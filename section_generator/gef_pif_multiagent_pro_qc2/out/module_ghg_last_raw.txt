{"body":"Paraguay has made significant strides in developing its greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, adhering to the IPCC 2006 Guidelines. The country has implemented a tiered approach across various sectors, including Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), and Waste. The institutional framework for inventory preparation is led by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MADES), which coordinates with technical teams and sectoral ministries to ensure comprehensive data collection and reporting. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, such as data fragmentation, capacity constraints, and the absence of country-specific emission factors, which hinder the accuracy and reliability of the inventory.

Paraguay's GHG inventory submissions have evolved over the years, with the most recent updates including the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted in 2024 and the First Biennial Update Report (BUR) in 2022. These submissions reflect a commitment to transparency and accountability in climate action, although the country continues to face issues related to staff turnover and the integration of GHG data into national planning processes. The application of QA/QC systems and the adoption of the 2019 IPCC Guidelines have improved the robustness of the inventory, yet ongoing capacity-building initiatives, such as the Capacity-building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) and the ICAT projects, are essential for further enhancement.

To align with the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), it is recommended that Paraguay focus on technical training for staff to advance to Tier 2 and Tier 3 methodologies, conduct thorough uncertainty analyses, and institutionalize Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) protocols. Strengthening the linkage between GHG inventory efforts and the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and national development plans will be crucial for achieving long-term climate goals."}
