{"body":"As part of the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement (2015) strengthened the global response to climate change. Article 13 established the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), under which Parties report on mitigation, adaptation and support. These information requirements present challenges to all countries, particularly those already facing impacts. For Paraguay, the latest submission of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is set for 2024, reflecting the country's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate change. The First Biennial Update Report (BTR) was submitted in 2022, providing an overview of the progress made in implementing its climate actions and the support received.

Paraguay's reporting under the ETF is crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in its climate efforts. However, the process is not without challenges, particularly for developing countries that may lack the necessary resources and technical expertise. The country has engaged various stakeholders, including civil society organizations, to enhance its climate initiatives. It is important to note that the number of entries for Civil Society Organizations (CSOs and NGOs) has been adjusted to comply with reporting limits, ensuring a balanced representation of voices in the climate dialogue.

In addition to its reporting obligations, Paraguay is involved in several initiatives aimed at addressing climate change impacts. One notable project is the GEF Project on Sustainable Land Management, which runs from 2021 to 2024 and has a budget of $5 million. This initiative aims to promote sustainable practices that can mitigate the effects of climate change while enhancing the livelihoods of local communities. Furthermore, adherence to the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories is essential for maintaining the integrity of Paraguay's emissions reporting, ensuring that the data provided is credible and aligned with international standards."}
