{"body":"The sections below outline status, progress, and challenges across the four core ETF modules. Jordan has made significant strides in implementing the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF), particularly in updating its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and aligning its reporting with international standards. The latest submissions from 2023 and 2024 have been incorporated, reflecting a commitment to transparency and accountability in climate action. However, there remains a need to streamline stakeholder engagement by reducing the number of entries in the 'Civil Society (CSOs and NGOs)' and 'Private sector' categories to comply with the recommended limit of eight, ensuring a more focused approach to collaboration.

In terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting, Jordan has adopted both the 2006 and the 2019 IPCC Guidelines, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of its emissions data. This dual adoption is crucial for maintaining credibility in international climate discussions. Despite these advancements, challenges persist, particularly regarding the financial requirements for implementing Jordan's NDCs, which are estimated at $3 billion by 2030. This figure currently lacks a citation, which could complicate efforts to secure necessary funding and support from international partners.

Overall, while Jordan's progress on the ETF modules is commendable, addressing the identified gaps and risks is essential for ensuring compliance with UNFCCC obligations and enhancing the effectiveness of its climate initiatives."}
