  "baseline_national_tf_header": "Jordan signed the UNFCCC on 12 November 1992 and ratified it on 28 March 1994. It also ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 23 May 2003 and the Paris Agreement on 21 September 2016, following its adoption on 12 December 2015. The following sections describe Jordan's institutional framework for climate action, key legislation and policies, stakeholders, and ongoing transparency initiatives. \n\nJordan has established a national transparency framework that aligns with its commitments under international climate agreements. This framework designates the Ministry of Environment as the primary institution responsible for climate policy and reporting. The country has developed various policies and strategies aimed at enhancing transparency in climate action, including the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which outline its climate goals and the financial needs associated with their implementation, estimated at $3 billion by 2030. However, it is essential to provide citations to support this financial figure to ensure credibility and facilitate funding efforts.\n\nIn addition to institutional arrangements, Jordan engages multiple stakeholders, including governmental bodies, civil society organizations, and the private sector, to foster a collaborative approach to climate action. Ongoing initiatives focus on improving data collection, monitoring, and reporting mechanisms to enhance transparency and accountability in climate-related activities. These efforts are crucial for building trust among stakeholders and securing the necessary financial resources to meet Jordan's climate commitments.",
  "baseline_institutional": "The institutional framework for climate action in Jordan is designed to ensure transparency and accountability in line with international commitments, particularly under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. The Ministry of Environment serves as the lead agency, coordinating climate-related activities across various sectors. This includes the preparation and submission of Biennial Update Reports (BURs) and Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), which are essential for tracking progress and maintaining compliance with international obligations. The framework emphasizes inter-ministerial coordination, with various ministries collaborating to align their policies and actions with national climate goals. Legal mandates support this framework, ensuring that data sharing and reporting mechanisms are established to facilitate effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders at all levels.\n\nJordan's state plan for confronting climate change is encapsulated in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which outline specific targets and strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate impacts. The plan identifies key sectors such as energy, water, and agriculture, where targeted interventions are necessary to achieve the outlined goals. The financial requirements for implementing these NDCs are estimated at $3 billion by 2030, highlighting the need for substantial investment and international support to realize these ambitions. This financial framework is critical for mobilizing resources and ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and programs are developed to address climate challenges effectively.\n\nData for the reports submitted by Jordan is sourced from various institutions, as outlined in the Project for the Adaptation to Climate Change (PATPA) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) documents. These institutions play a vital role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating climate-related data, which is essential for accurate reporting and informed decision-making. The collaboration among these entities ensures that the data is reliable and comprehensive, thereby enhancing the credibility of Jordan's climate reports.\n\nSeveral key institutions are involved in data collection, financial management, and policy formulation related to climate action in Jordan. The Ministry of Environment, the Department of Statistics, and the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation are among the primary agencies responsible for inventory management systems and reporting frameworks. These institutions contribute to the National Communications (NC) and other relevant reports, ensuring that data is systematically gathered and analyzed. The institutional arrangements and inventory management systems detailed in BUR1 and BTR documents further illustrate the collaborative efforts among these institutions to support Jordan's climate objectives, providing a robust foundation for ongoing climate action.",
  "baseline_policy": "Jordan's national climate policy framework is anchored in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), and various climate acts that collectively outline the country's vision for addressing climate change. The NDCs articulate Jordan's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31% by 2030, relative to a business-as-usual scenario, with an estimated financial requirement of $3 billion to implement these measures. This financial need is critical for achieving the outlined targets and is supported by the legal and institutional frameworks established in the Biennial Update Reports (BUR) and National Communications (NC). These documents serve as foundational legal bases for Jordan's climate and environmental policies, aligning with the Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) to enhance the country's transparency framework under the Paris Agreement. The BUR and NC detail the national circumstances and institutional arrangements that facilitate climate action, including the establishment of the Ministry of Environment as the lead agency for climate policy coordination and implementation.\n\nIn addition to the NDCs, Jordan's climate strategy is further reinforced by the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and the National Adaptation Strategy, which outline specific actions and measures to mitigate and adapt to climate impacts. The NCCP emphasizes the importance of integrating climate considerations into national development plans and sectoral strategies, ensuring a holistic approach to climate governance. Recent updates in the Policy Action and Technical Assistance Program (PATPA) and the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) have highlighted the need for continuous improvement in data collection, monitoring, and reporting mechanisms to track progress effectively. These updates reflect Jordan's commitment to enhancing its climate resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts.\n\nLooking ahead, several critical next steps are necessary to address gaps within the existing policy framework. First, securing the necessary funding and investment to meet the $3 billion requirement for NDC implementation is essential, which may involve seeking international support and fostering public-private partnerships. Additionally, enhancing stakeholder engagement and capacity-building initiatives will be vital to ensure that local communities and sectors are equipped to contribute to climate action. Finally, regular reviews and updates of the NDCs and associated policies will be necessary to reflect evolving scientific knowledge, technological advancements, and socio-economic conditions, thereby ensuring that Jordan remains on track to meet its climate targets.",
