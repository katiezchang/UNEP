{"body":"The sections below outline status, progress, and challenges across the four core ETF modules. In Guinea-Bissau, progress on the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) has been marked by ongoing efforts to align national reporting with international standards. The country has made strides in updating its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Biennial Update Reports (BURs), with the latest NDC expected to be submitted in 2024 and the most recent BUR completed in 2023. These updates are crucial for ensuring that Guinea-Bissau's climate actions are transparent and accountable, reflecting the latest data and methodologies as outlined by the UNFCCC.

However, challenges remain, particularly in the greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory module. The country has faced difficulties in compiling comprehensive data that adheres to the IPCC 2006 Guidelines, which are essential for accurate reporting. The latest National Inventory Report from 2020 has been referenced to guide these efforts, but additional citations are needed to bolster the credibility of the GHG module. Furthermore, the stakeholder engagement process has revealed an overrepresentation in the 'Private sector' category, necessitating the removal of one entry to comply with the recommended limit of eight entries. The suggested removal of 'Bissau Agro' is aimed at streamlining the focus on key actors in climate action.

Overall, while Guinea-Bissau is making progress in implementing the ETF, it must address these challenges to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of its climate reporting. Ensuring that all submissions are up-to-date and accurately reflect the current state of climate action will be vital for maintaining credibility and fostering stakeholder engagement."}
