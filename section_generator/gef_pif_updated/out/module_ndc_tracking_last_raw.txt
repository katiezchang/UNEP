{"body":"The NDC Tracking Module for Guinea-Bissau outlines a comprehensive framework for monitoring the country's climate commitments, focusing on both mitigation and adaptation targets. The NDC includes six key mitigation actions and identifies 17 priority areas that span across various sectors, including Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), and Waste. Institutional arrangements have been established to delineate roles and responsibilities among different stakeholders, ensuring that these actions are integrated with the State Plan for Confronting Climate Change. This integration is crucial for aligning national efforts with global climate goals and enhancing the effectiveness of climate action.

The Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) system plays a vital role in tracking progress towards these targets. Achievements under the Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT I) Project have been particularly notable in the Agriculture and LULUCF sectors, where initial frameworks for monitoring have been developed. However, significant gaps remain, including the absence of a digital platform for data collection and reporting, which leads to a reliance on manual processes that can hinder timely and accurate reporting. Additionally, limited sectoral integration and insufficient technical and financial capacity pose challenges to effective implementation and monitoring.

To enhance the effectiveness of the NDC Tracking Module, it is recommended that Guinea-Bissau automates and standardizes its reporting processes. Strengthening institutional coordination among the various sectors involved will be essential to ensure that all stakeholders are aligned and working towards common goals. Furthermore, aligning the MRV processes with the National Development Plan (NDP) and the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) provisions will facilitate a more cohesive approach to climate action, ultimately supporting the country's long-term sustainability and resilience efforts."}
