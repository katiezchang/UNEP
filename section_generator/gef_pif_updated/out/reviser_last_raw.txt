  "baseline_national_tf_header": "Guinea-Bissau signed the UNFCCC on 12 November 1992 and ratified it on 29 September 1994. It also ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 22 September 2005 and the Paris Agreement on 21 September 2016, following its adoption on 12 December 2015. The following sections describe Guinea-Bissau's institutional framework for climate action, key legislation and policies, stakeholders, and ongoing transparency initiatives. \n\nThe institutional framework for climate action in Guinea-Bissau is characterized by a multi-stakeholder approach involving government agencies, civil society, and the private sector. Key legislation and policies include the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which outline the country's commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate impacts. Stakeholders play a crucial role in implementing these policies, with ongoing initiatives aimed at improving transparency and accountability in climate action.\n\nOngoing transparency initiatives in Guinea-Bissau focus on enhancing the reporting and monitoring of climate actions. The country is working to align its reporting with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and has submitted its latest National Inventory Report in 2020. However, there is a need for clarity regarding the specific actions and metrics used to measure progress in the NDC tracking module. This will ensure that stakeholders can effectively monitor and evaluate the implementation of climate commitments.",
  "baseline_institutional": "Guinea-Bissau has established a comprehensive institutional framework for climate action, which is essential for maintaining transparency in its climate commitments. The country is committed to keeping its Biennial Update Reports (BURs), Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs), and other reports aligned with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement up to date. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development serves as the lead agency, coordinating inter-ministerial efforts to ensure that climate data is collected, analyzed, and reported effectively. This coordination is crucial for fulfilling legal mandates related to climate action and for fostering collaboration among various governmental bodies, including the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, which play significant roles in climate-related initiatives.\n\nTo confront climate change, Guinea-Bissau has developed a national strategy that emphasizes resilience and adaptation. This strategy outlines specific actions aimed at reducing vulnerability to climate impacts, enhancing food security, and promoting sustainable land management practices. The government has recognized the importance of integrating climate considerations into national development plans and policies, thereby ensuring that climate action is a priority across all sectors. The strategy also includes mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, allowing for the participation of civil society and local communities in the implementation of climate initiatives.\n\nData for the reports required under the UNFCCC framework is sourced from various institutions, as highlighted in the Project for the Adaptation of the Agricultural Sector to Climate Change (PATPA) and the Global Environment Facility's Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency (GEF CBIT) documents. Key institutions involved in data collection include the National Institute of Statistics, which provides demographic and socio-economic data, and the Ministry of Environment, which oversees environmental monitoring and assessment. These institutions collaborate to ensure that the data used in climate reports is accurate, reliable, and reflective of the current situation in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nSeveral institutions play pivotal roles in data collection, financial management, and policy formulation related to climate action. The National Directorate of Environment is responsible for inventory management systems and ensuring compliance with international reporting standards, as outlined in the BUR1 and BTR documents. Additionally, the National Climate Change Committee facilitates coordination among stakeholders and oversees the implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The Integrated Climate Action Toolkit (ICAT) also provides guidance on measuring and tracking progress towards climate goals, ensuring that Guinea-Bissau's climate policies are effectively monitored and evaluated. These institutional arrangements are critical for enhancing the country's capacity to respond to climate change and for fulfilling its international obligations.",
  "baseline_policy": "Guinea-Bissau's national climate policy framework is anchored in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategy (LT-LEDS), which outline the country's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate change. The NDC, updated in 2024, sets ambitious targets for emission reductions and emphasizes the importance of sustainable land management, reforestation, and renewable energy development. The legal and institutional framework for climate action is further supported by the country’s Biennial Update Reports (BUR) and National Communications (NC), which provide a comprehensive overview of national circumstances and the legal basis for environmental policies. These documents serve as foundational elements for Guinea-Bissau's engagement with the Global Environment Facility's Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT), ensuring that the country adheres to international climate reporting standards and enhances its transparency framework.\n\nThe National Communication (Annex I) and subsequent updates from the Policy and Action Tracking Platform for Adaptation (PATPA) and the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) highlight significant advancements in Guinea-Bissau's climate policy landscape. The government has enacted several laws and decrees aimed at addressing climate change, including the National Climate Change Strategy and the National Adaptation Plan, which align with the objectives set forth in the NDC. These frameworks not only guide the implementation of climate actions but also facilitate stakeholder engagement across various sectors, including agriculture, forestry, and energy. The integration of climate considerations into national development plans underscores the commitment to a holistic approach in confronting climate challenges, ensuring that economic growth is pursued alongside environmental sustainability.\n\nLooking ahead, there are critical next steps for Guinea-Bissau to address existing gaps within its climate policy framework. This includes verifying and updating the NDC submission for 2024 against the UNFCCC website to ensure accuracy in reporting. Additionally, enhancing the clarity of the NDC tracking module by detailing specific actions and metrics for measuring progress will be essential for effective monitoring and evaluation. The removal of 'Bissau Agro' from the private sector category, while necessary for compliance, may limit stakeholder representation, necessitating a strategic approach to engage a diverse range of private sector actors. Overall, strengthening these elements will bolster Guinea-Bissau's capacity to meet its climate commitments and foster resilience against the impacts of climate change.",
