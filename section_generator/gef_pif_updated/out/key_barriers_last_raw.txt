{"body":"Paraguay faces several key barriers in organizing climate data, which significantly hampers its ability to effectively address climate change challenges. The lack of a centralized and comprehensive climate data management system complicates the collection, analysis, and dissemination of relevant information. This disorganization not only affects the quality of data available for decision-making but also limits the capacity of stakeholders to engage in informed discussions and planning processes. Furthermore, the incomplete implementation of the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) modules reflects a broader issue of insufficient capacity within governmental and non-governmental entities. This gap in capacity undermines the effectiveness of climate action initiatives and hinders the country's ability to meet international reporting obligations.

Additionally, Paraguay's reliance on external projects and consultants poses a significant challenge to sustainable planning and implementation of climate strategies. While these external resources can provide valuable expertise, they often lead to a fragmented approach that lacks integration with national priorities and long-term goals. This dependency can result in short-term solutions that do not adequately address the underlying issues or foster local ownership of climate initiatives. Consequently, the effectiveness of climate actions is diminished, as stakeholders may not fully utilize the insights and recommendations provided by external consultants in their planning processes. Addressing these barriers is crucial for Paraguay to enhance its climate resilience and ensure a more coordinated and effective response to climate change."}
