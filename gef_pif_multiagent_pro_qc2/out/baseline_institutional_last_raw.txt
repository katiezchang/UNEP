  "body": "Ghana's institutional framework for climate action is anchored in a multi-tiered governance structure that involves various ministries, agencies, and local authorities. The Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation (MESTI) serves as the lead agency responsible for coordinating national climate policies and strategies. This ministry works closely with other key ministries, including the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Local Government, Decentralization and Rural Development, to ensure a cohesive approach to climate action across different sectors. The inter-ministerial coordination is facilitated through the National Climate Change Committee, which brings together representatives from various sectors to discuss and align on climate-related initiatives and policies.

Legal mandates for climate action in Ghana are established through several legislative frameworks, including the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the National Climate Change Policy. These laws provide the necessary authority for the government to implement climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Additionally, the Climate Change Policy outlines the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders, ensuring that climate action is integrated into national development plans. Data sharing is a critical component of this framework, with the Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant institutions tasked with collecting, analyzing, and disseminating climate-related data to inform decision-making processes.

At the subnational level, local governments play a vital role in implementing climate action initiatives tailored to their specific contexts. District Assemblies are empowered to develop and execute local climate action plans that align with national policies while addressing local vulnerabilities and priorities. This decentralized approach fosters community engagement and ensures that climate strategies are relevant and effective at the grassroots level. Furthermore, collaboration with civil society organizations and the private sector enhances the capacity of local governments to address climate challenges, promoting a more inclusive and participatory approach to climate governance in Ghana."
