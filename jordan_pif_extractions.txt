## 1. NDC Tracking Module
- By 2024 Jordan had already delivered 24.8% of its pledged 31% GHG reduction versus 2010, avoiding roughly 9,269 Gg CO₂e, driven by renewable electricity rising from 12% to 28.5% (~5 GW added capacity), EV market share growing from 1% to 21% (~120,000 vehicles), and large-scale nature-based sequestration (1,000 dunums restored; 1 million trees plus 32,500 urban plantings, sequestering ~11,900 tCO₂e/year). [p.2-3](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- NDC 3.0 plans to raise conditional ambition beyond the current 31% threshold (with green hydrogen, advanced storage, building standards, industrial efficiency) and to exceed the 5% unconditional cut through accelerated EV adoption, distributed solar, decentralized storage, and urban greening. [p.4](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- The contribution embeds a 2050 net-zero trajectory and economy-wide pathways: >35% renewables enabled by utility-scale storage and pumped hydro; green-hydrogen development aligned with the EU–Jordan partnership; completion of BRT phases and freight modernization; nationwide fast-charging and natural-gas transition in transport. [p.6](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- Water-energy nexus mitigation includes running the Aqaba–Amman desalination conveyance on 50% renewables, low-emission pumping, leakage-reduction, and climate-resilient utility operations; agriculture focuses on precision irrigation, drought-resilient seed varieties, integrated pest management, biodiversity corridors, and rangeland restoration. [p.6-7](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- Waste strategies move toward circular economy (extended-producer responsibility, digital waste-tracking, waste-to-energy) while industry adopts results-based financing and technology-transfer agreements to accelerate decarbonization. [p.7](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- ICTU alignment will quantify sectoral trajectories to 2035, document methodologies, integrate Energy Strategy 2035, the NAP, Biodiversity Strategy, and SDG linkages, while the Central Bank operationalizes climate-finance taxonomy, reporting, and green-finance guidelines. [p.8](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- Governance for NDC 3.0 rests on the National Climate Change Committee (16 secretary-generals across ministries) with parliamentary briefings, sectoral working groups, governorate consultations, and digital engagement to track progress and gather feedback. [p.9-10](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)

## 2. Support Needed and Received
- Meeting the conditional 26% portion of the 31% NDC target requires international finance; the annual climate-finance gap is estimated at JOD 1,095 million (~3.4% of GDP) after bottom-up costing across energy, transport, water, waste, industry, and agriculture. [p.107-108](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
- Total NDC investment needs equal USD 7.92 billion (USD 7.59 billion mitigation; USD 329 million adaptation) across 43 priority actions; domestic resources cover USD 565 million for the 5% unconditional mitigation goal. [p.109](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
- Annexed CTF tables record support received from multilateral and bilateral partners (e.g., GEF-UNDP grants of USD 1.23 million and USD 1.14 million, plus USD 6 million regional adaptation funding) delivering capacity-building, transparency, and readiness outcomes. [p.110](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
- Methodologies for tracking support rely on coordinated reporting by the Ministry of Environment (ETF focal point), Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (ODA tracking), and Ministry of Finance (developing climate budget tagging), with donor data verification. [p.106-108](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)

[p.61-62](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
- Key categories in 2023 were dominated by energy combustion (road transport, energy industries using gaseous and solid fuels) and natural gas fugitive CH₄, accounting for ~95% of total emissions. [p.60-61](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
- Land-use mapping (2003–2023) shows cropland contraction (113,036 ha to 106,101 ha), settlement expansion (52,810 ha to 162,818 ha), and variable grassland, informing LULUCF fluxes. [p.52-53](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)

## 7. National Policy Framework
- National Climate Change Policy (2013) and updated policy (2022–2050) provide long-term mitigation/adaptation roadmaps; the Climate Change Bylaw and Environmental Protection Law (2017) legally empower coordination, MRV, and finance mobilization. [p.64-65](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
- Green Growth Framework (2017) and sector action plans (2019) align climate ambition with economic modernization, job creation, and just transition objectives. [p.5](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- National strategies (Energy Strategy 2035, NAP, Biodiversity Strategy, Economic Modernization Vision) are being hard-linked to the NDC via ICTU requirements, ensuring coherence across planning instruments. [p.8](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)

## 8. Climate Transparency in Jordan
- Jordan launched a domestic web-based MRV system in 2018 for renewable and efficiency projects and is expanding it to other sectors and the national finance registry under the ETF. [p.8,106-108,117](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- Flexibility is applied for historical time series (pre-2012) and F-gases due to data constraints, with improvement timelines set for BTR2/BTR3 (e.g., uncertainty analysis, projections). [p.113-115](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
- Planned enhancements include operationalizing the national MRV framework, climate-finance registry, and long-term low-emission strategy, supported by training and international cooperation. [p.116-117](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)

## 9. Official Reporting to the UNFCCC
- Jordan has submitted BUR1 (2017), BUR2 (2021), NC4 (2023), and BTR1 (2025) with accompanying NID, CRT, and support tables, fulfilling ETF obligations and documenting improvements in data systems, QA/QC, and institutional coordination. [p.55-63,116](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)

## 10. Key Barriers / Constraints
- Dynamic projections warn of +4 °C warming, −21% precipitation, and extreme heatwaves under RCP8.5 by 2070–2100, intensifying water scarcity and agricultural stress. [p.26](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/NAP_Jordan_2025_ENG.pdf)
- Current water balance shows deficits expanding from −116 MCM to −1,542 MCM by 2100 even with desalination, underscoring systemic scarcity. [p.41](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Hashemite%20Kingdom%20of%20Jordan%204th%20National%20Communication.pdf)
- Climate hazards (flash floods, droughts, heatwaves) have increased, with flash floods causing 110 deaths and hundreds of millions in losses over three decades, driving priority for DRR and resilient infrastructure. [p.5,68](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20NDC%203.0%20Vision_final.pdf)
- Financial and data constraints persist—limited capacity for detailed projections, incomplete F-gas data, and fragmented reporting responsibilities—necessitating sustained international support and institutional strengthening. [p.107-115](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Jordan%20First%20BTR_6Nov.pdf)
