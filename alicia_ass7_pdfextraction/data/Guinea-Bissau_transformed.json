Despite these efforts, there\nare still challenges related to limited institutional capacity and the need for a more robust\nintegration of adaptation actions into the regular operations of public institutions.\nStrengthening institutional capacity and improving inter-institutional communication are\npriority areas for ensuring the effectiveness of adaptation actions.\n\nThe effectiveness of current institutional arrangements is also related to the technical and\nadministrative capacity of the government institutions involved, especially in terms of\nspecialised human resources, adequate infrastructure and access to the necessary\ntechnologies. Continuous improvement of these capabilities is essential to ensure that\ninstitutions are able to effectively implement adaptation actions and integrate them into\ntheir routine operations.\n\n3.3. Legal framework related to climate change\n\nConsiderations and planning for adaptation to climate change in Guinea-Bissau are at an\nearly stage of development. Although some climate change integration activities have\nbeen carried out in the framework of the implementation of the project \"Strengthening\nClimate Change Resilience and Adaptive Capacity in Guinea-Bissau's Agricultural and\nWater Sectors\", the country faces major challenges, mainly due to the absence of a\nnational climate change policy framework and an established national adaptation\nplanning process. It is therefore necessary to create an enabling environment to facilitate\nthe integration of adaptation measures into national development objectives and to\nstrengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action,\nwhich is responsible for the development of environmental and climate change adaptation\npolicies.\n\nTable 12 below presents some policies and plans on climate change:\n\nTable 12: Policies and Plans on Climate Change:\n\nPolicies/Plans\n\nDescription\nParis Agreement.\nGuinea-Bissau is a signatory to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and ratified the\nParis Agreement in April 2016.\n\nNational Determined Contribution\n(NDC).\nGuinea-Bissau submitted its National Contribution (Expected)\nin September 2015. The document includes mitigation and\nadaptation components. The NDC was inspired by the\nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy (DENARP II) and is\naligned with the Strategic and Operational Plan - Terra Ranka\n2015-2025.\nGuinea-Bissau's\ncontribution\nto\nmitigation\nincludes the implementation of policies and planned actions in\nthe forestry and energy sectors. Its contribution to adaptation\nbroadly identifies agriculture, the coastal zone, cross-cutting\nareas, disaster risk management, education,\nenergy,\nenvironment, health and tourism as areas requiring adaptation\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 49\nactions. It also identifies gaps and needs, as well as high-level\nadaptation objectives. One of these gaps is the need to carry\nout a cost-benefit analysis of adaptation measures. According\nto the updated 2021 NDC, the implementation of adaptation\nand mitigation measures depends on external partners that\nprovide financial resources, technology, and capacity building.\nAlthough the impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change are\npresented, they are based on NAPA (2006) and are therefore\nconsidered outdated.\nNational Action Plan for Adaptation\n(NAPA, 2006).\nPANA has defined several priority strategic actions to address\nthe risks and impacts of climate change in Guinea-Bissau.\nThese actions aim to increase food security for rural\npopulations in order to increase their resilience, reduce\npressure on forest and fisheries resources, and improve\naccess to drinking water. PANA prioritises agriculture and\ntourism, as well as water resources, coastal erosion, and\nbiodiversity.\nThird National Communication\n(TNC).\nThe 2018 TCN presents, among other things, the climateinduced impacts and suggested adaptation needs for the main\nsectors of agriculture and livestock, energy, forestry,\nbiodiversity, fisheries and water resources. The TCN proposes\na series of adaptation measures. For the water sector, it\nproposes the establishment of a coherent and consistent\nstrategy, using an integrated approach to water resources\nmanagement and the increase of rainwater harvesting and\nstorage capacity to increase surface and groundwater\nreserves. For the agricultural sector, it proposes a series of\nadaptation measures that vary according to ecosystems.\nThese ecosystems are those of the mangrove swamps, those\nof the Bas-Fonds (fresh water), those of the plateau, and those\nof backyard agriculture.\nHyogo Frame/Sendai Frame.\nUnder the Hyogo Framework/Sendai Framework, GuineaBissau has been making efforts since 2010 to develop its\ncapacity\nin\nDisaster\nRisk\nReduction/Disaster\nRisk\nManagement (DRR/DRM), which led to the adoption of the\nNational Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction and the creation\nand operationalisation of the National Civil Protection Service\n(SNPC).\n3.4. IMPACTS, RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES\n\n3.4.1. Analysis of projected past and future climate change\n\nAvailable information on past climate change indicates general trends, such as increasing\naverage annual temperature and changes in precipitation patterns, reported mainly by\nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its global and regional\nassessment reports (IPCC, 2014; IPCC, 2021) and the new climate scenarios for GuineaBissau 2016 - 2045, provided by the National Institute of Meteorology (INM), there is a gradual\nincrease in temperatures, accompanied by increasing variability in precipitation regimes and a\nhigher frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and intense rainfall.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 50\nLooking ahead, climate projections indicate the continuation of these trends, with further\nincreases in average temperatures, intensification of extreme weather events, and\nchanges in precipitation patterns. Specifically, the IPCC climate models suggest that\nGuinea-Bissau could face significant increases in average annual temperature, ranging\nfrom 1.5 °C to 3 °C by 2100, depending on the emissions scenario considered (IPCC,\n2021).\n\nThe new climate scenarios project significant changes in the climate of Guinea-Bissau.\nSystematic increases in average daily temperature are expected to reach +1.4 °C in the\nperiod 2016-2045 and +2.2 °C in 2046-2075, according to Scenario CRP4.5 ( low\nemissions ); and from +1.6 °C to +3.1 °C in the period 2046-2075, according to Scenario\nRCP8.5 ( high emissions ).\n\nFor the maximum daily temperature, the average of the regional climate models used\nindicate an increase in the order of +1.2 °C [+0.8 °C to +1.7 °C] on the coast (Bissau and\nBolama) to +1.4 °C [+1.0 °C to +1.6 °C] in the interior and east zone, according to\nScenario RCP4.5 ( low emissions ), for the period 2016-2045 compared to Normal 19611990. An increase from +1.3ºC [+0.9ºC to 2.0ºC] on the coast to +1.5ºC [+1.2ºC to 2.1ºC]\ninland, according to Scenario RCP8.5 ( high emissions ), for the period 2016-2045\ncompared to Normal 1961-1990 (see Figure 33).\n\nFigure 6: Projected changes in the maximum daily temperature (ºC) for the period (20162045): a) RCP4.5 scenario (low emissions ) and b) RCP8.5 scenario (high emissions).\n\nRegarding precipitation, the average of the fourteen models used in the simulations\nindicate a slight increase in average daily precipitation of +10% for the period 20162045, according to Scenario RCP4.5 ( Low emissions ). For the RCP8.5 Scenario (\"High\nemissions\"), a climatologically identical situation to Normal is expected (without significant\nvariations from the reference period: 1961-1990), with the exception of the\nsouthwestern part of the Bijagós Archipelago and the southern part of the Tombali\nRegion (Cacine Sector) where an increase of +5% is expected.\n\nAverage Daily Precipitation (in %) 2016-2045 ; Scenario RCP4.5 (\"low emissions\"), the\naverage of the set of models used in the simulations projects a slight increase in average\ndaily precipitation, in the order of +3% [+2% to +5%] in almost all the national territory,\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 51\nwith the exception of the southwestern part of the Bijagós Archipelago, where an increase\nbetween +5% and +10% is expected. For the RCP8.5 Scenario (\"high emissions\"), a\nclimatologically identical situation to Normal is expected (without significant variations\nfrom the reference period: 1961-1990), with the exception of the southwestern part of the\nBijagós Archipelago and the southern part of the Tombali Region (Canine Sector) where\na slight increase of about + 2% to +5% is expected.\n\nFigure 7: Projected changes in average daily precipitation (in %), for the period (20162045): a) Scenario RCP4.5 (low emissions) and b) Scenario RCP8.5 (high emissions)\n\nHowever, it is important to highlight the significant uncertainties associated with these\nprojections, especially due to the scarcity of detailed historical data and the limited spatial\nresolution of the climate models available for the region. In addition, the absence of\nspecific national studies contributes to additional uncertainty regarding the exact\nmagnitude of the projected changes and their detailed impacts on Guinea-Bissau’s\nterritory and communities (UNDP, 2020; GEF, 2021).\n\nFor the scenarios of average sea level rise, according to the MAGICC SCENGEN Model,\nversion 5.1, an increase of approximately 1.5 million is expected by 2020 6.5 cm and will\nreach 1.5 million by 2050. 20 cm. These sea level rises, combined with coastal erosion,\ncan have drastic consequences for low-lying countries and small islands such as GuineaBissau, particularly affecting the country's economy, especially populations living in\ncoastal areas and their livelihoods.\n\n3.5. IMPACTS, RISKS AND VULNERABILITIES IN KEY SOCIO-ECONOMIC\nSECTORS\n\nAvailable assessments, including reports produced by the Third National Communication\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other\ninternational organisations, highlight significant impacts on Guinea-Bissau's key socioeconomic sectors resulting from current and future climate risks.\n\nThe agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with prolonged\ndroughts, irregular rainfall and frequent flooding reducing productivity and affecting food\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 52\nsecurity. Small farmers in rural areas are most affected due to their direct dependence\non climatic conditions for subsistence and commercial cultivation.\n\nFigure 8Subject: Horticulture for adapting agriculture to climate change\n\nThe fishing sector, critical to the national economy and food security of coastal\ncommunities, faces significant risks due to rising sea levels, rising ocean temperatures\nand extreme weather events. These changes directly threaten marine and coastal\necosystems, which are essential for the reproduction and maintenance of fishing species.\n\nFigure 9Subject: Market offer / Artisanal fishermen\n\nUrban areas, particularly the capital, Bissau, are increasingly vulnerable to frequent\nflooding and flooding, impacting critical infrastructure, housing and public health services.\nVulnerable urban populations, including women, children, and marginalised communities,\nface increased risks due to lack of adequate infrastructure and limited capacity to respond\nto climate emergencies.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 53\n\nFigure 10Subject: Flooding in urban areas of Guinea-Bissau\n\nRural populations and vulnerable social groups, especially women and children, face\nadditional challenges due to direct exposure to extreme events and limited adaptability.\nWomen, who are responsible for much of family farming and natural-resource\nmanagement, are disproportionately affected by climate change.\n\nThese analyses emphasise the urgent need for integrated policies and concrete actions\nfor adaptation and resilience, considering the socioeconomic and cultural particularities\nof Guinea-Bissau, to protect and strengthen the sectors and communities most vulnerable\nto the adverse effects of climate change.\n3.6. PRIORITIES AND BARRIERS TO ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN\nGUINEA-BISSAU\n\nGuinea-Bissau has made progress in implementing climate change adaptation strategies\ndespite structural and financial challenges. National priorities reflect the need to protect\necosystems, ensure food security, strengthen infrastructure and promote sustainable\ndevelopment.\n\n3.6.1. National priorities for climate adaptation\n\nGuinea-Bissau's national priorities for climate change adaptation are outlined in a number\nof policy and strategic documents that reflect the country's commitment to addressing the\nchallenges posed by climate change. The main document that defines these priorities is\nthe National Action Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA), drawn up in 2006.\nThis plan identified three sectors as the most vulnerable:\n Agricultural Sector : Developing the adaptability of agropastoral and forestry\nproduction systems.\n Water Resources : Promoting integrated water resources management.\n Coastal Zone : Protect and prevent degradation of coastal zones resulting from\nclimate change.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 54\n\nIn addition to PANA, Guinea-Bissau has integrated climate change into other national\nstrategies, such as the National Development Plan 2020-2023, prioritising the sustainable\nmanagement of natural resources and adaptation to climate change.\n\nThe country also developed its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), updated in\n2021, which aligns climate action with sustainable development goals, emphasising\ngender integration and the preservation of national carbon sinks.\n\nThese documents reflect Guinea-Bissau's commitment to mainstream climate change\nadaptation into public policy, aiming to reduce the vulnerability of critical sectors and\npromote sustainable and resilient development.\n\n3.6.2. Barriers to adaptation\n\nGuinea-Bissau faces several barriers that hinder its ability to adapt effectively to climate\nchange. The main constraints include a lack of specialised technical capacity, insufficient\nfinancial resources and institutional challenges. These constraints undermine the\nimplementation of adaptation strategies needed to address adverse climate impacts.\n\nTo overcome these barriers, the country needs specific support in several areas:\n\n- Institutional Strengthening and Technical Training : It is crucial to develop and enhance\nthe technical capabilities of national institutions to plan and implement adaptation actions.\nThis includes the ongoing training of professionals and the strengthening of government\nstructures responsible for environmental and climate management.\n\n- Access to International Climate Finance : Obtaining financial resources from\ninternational funds is essential to enable adaptation projects. Guinea-Bissau needs\nassistance to prepare competitive bids and meet criteria required by global funders.\n\n- Transfer of Appropriate Technologies : The introduction of sustainable and locally\nadapted technologies can increase the resilience of vulnerable sectors such as\nagriculture and water management. This includes climate-resilient farming practices and\nefficient water-use systems.\n\n- Community Engagement and Public Awareness: Involving local communities in the\nadaptation process is essential. Education and awareness programmes can empower\npopulations to adopt adaptive practices and actively participate in the implementation of\nsolutions.\n\nMeeting these specific needs will allow Guinea-Bissau to strengthen its resilience to\nclimate change and promote sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 55\n3.7. ADAPTATION STRATEGIES, POLICIES, PLANS, TARGETS AND ACTIONS TO\nINTEGRATE CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION IN GUINEA-BISSAU\n\nOngoing national adaptation policy processes often include strategic initiatives\ncoordinated by different instruments and approaches, such as National Adaptation Plans\n(NAPs), Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), National Adaptation Action\nProgrammes (NAPs) and the integration of adaptation into national development plans.\nHere is a detailed description of each of these processes:\n\n3.7.1. National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NAP)\n\nThe NAP is currently under development in Guinea-Bissau with the support of\ninternational partners such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and\nthe Green Climate Fund (VCF). The central objective of the NAP is to strengthen the\nnational capacity to identify, prioritise and implement effective adaptation measures in\nkey sectors. This process involves:\n\na) Diagnosis and assessment of climate vulnerabilities especially in priority sectors such\nas agriculture, water, forestry, coastal zone, health and infrastructure;\n\n(b) national and regional multi-stakeholder consultations to ensure social inclusion,\ngender equity and community participation in adaptation decisions;\n\n(c) developing sector-specific adaptation strategies, including detailed programmes and\nactions, with clear timelines and budget estimates;\n\n(d) identification of financing and capacity-building needs including the development of\ntechnical, institutional and human capacities for the effective implementation of the NAP;\n\ne) Integrating the NAP into sectoral and regional policies and plans, enhancing coherence\nwith sustainable development policies, poverty reduction strategies and local territorial\nplans.\n\n3.7.2. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)\n\nThe NDCs represent a strategic commitment of Guinea-Bissau under the Paris\nAgreement (UNFCCC). The country submitted its first NDC in 2015, recently updated in\n2021. As regards adaptation, the NDC sets out priority actions to increase national\nresilience to climate impacts, involving:\n\na) Restoration and protection of coastal and marine ecosystems with particular attention\nto mangroves, which are essential for natural defence against floods and coastal erosion;\n\n(b) promoting resilient and climate-adapted farming practices, including drought-resistant\nvarieties, sustainable water management and agro-ecological techniques;\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 56\nc) Strengthen national early warning and climate risk management systems by increasing\ninstitutional capacity for a rapid and effective response to climate emergencies;\n\nd) Strengthening technical and scientific capacity by investing in applied climate\nresearch, environmental education and specialised technical training;\n\ne) Mobilising international climate finance to complement national resources for the\neffective implementation of the proposed measures.\n\n3.7.3. National Action Programmes for Adaptation (NAAPs)\nGuinea-Bissau's National Climate Action Plan (PANA), developed in 2006, was the first\nstrategic approach to address the challenges of climate change in the country, serving as\nan emergency plan for immediate priority actions. PANA initially identified the most\nvulnerable sectors and areas and proposed concrete actions to reduce climate vulnerability.\nKey actions highlighted include:\n\na) Integrated water resources management to ensure safe and sustainable access to\nwater, especially in periods of prolonged drought;\n(b) promoting food security through crop diversification, introducing climate-resilient\nfarming techniques and improving traditional farming practices;\nc) Protecting and restoring forests and mangroves, recognising the importance of these\necosystems for local and regional climate stability;\nd) improving public health systems, especially in the management of climate-sensitive\ndiseases such as malaria and diarrheal diseases;\ne) Awareness raising and community empowerment for participatory management of\nnatural resources and adaptation to climate change.\n\nCurrently, many actions initiated by NAPA continue to be developed and deepened in\nNAP and NDCs, creating continuity and strategic complementarity.\n\n3.7.4. Integrating Adaptation into National and Sectoral Development Plans\nGuinea-Bissau has adopted an integrated approach to adaptation, aligning climate\nobjectives with national policies and sectoral development plans, such as:\na) Strategic and Operational Plan \"Terra Ranka\" (2015–2025): This document includes\nadaptation as one of the pillars to promote sustainable development and ecoNOmica and\nenvironmental resilience;\nb) National Strategy for Poverty Reduction and Inclusive Growth : Highlights actions to\nreduce social, environmental and economic vulnerabilities in the face of climate change;\nc) Agricultural and Rural Sector Master Plan : explicitly provides for integrated climate\nactions to increase agricultural productivity and food security by reducing the negative\nimpacts of climate extremes;\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 57\nd) National Plan for Integrated Water Resources Management : Aims to ensure the\navailability and quality of water, especially in the face of climate variability;\ne) Strategic Coastal Management Plan : Incorporates adaptation strategies, including\ncoastal protection and ecological restoration, to mitigate erosion and flooding.\n3.7.5. Institutional Strengthening and Intersectoral Coordination\nTo implement these processes, Guinea-Bissau has strengthened its institutional climate\ngovernance mechanisms, including:\na) Creation and strengthening of the National Committee on Climate Change (CNMC),\nbody responsible for coordinating national climate policies;\nb) Strengthen the capacity of the National Institute of the Environment (INA) and the\nInstitute of Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP), responsible for the implementation\nand monitoring of environmental and climate policies;\nc) Implementation of Climate Project Management Units, such as the Coastal Project\nand the Early Warning Project, Energy Mini-Networks Project, which play an essential\nrole in the practical implementation of adaptation measures on the ground.\nThese processes together illustrate Guinea-Bissau’s coordinated, coherent, and\nintegrated approach to addressing climate change and strengthening national resilience\nin all sectors critical to sustainable development.\n3.7.6. Adaptation targets\nGuinea-Bissau's national adaptation targets are clearly defined at three main levels:\n1. International commitments (NDCs – Nationally Determined Contributions);\n2. The National Adaptation Plan (NAP); and 3. National and sectoral sustainable\ndevelopment plans and strategies.\nThese policies are interlinked to set concrete short-, medium-, and long-term goals and\nguide the country in strengthening climate resilience.\n3.8. PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADAPTATION\n\nGuinea-Bissau has taken significant steps to consolidate adaptation to climate change as\na national priority. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), presented in 2021,\nsets clear adaptation targets in key sectors such as water, agriculture, forests, health and\ncoastal areas. These commitments are aligned with the Paris Agreement, in its Article 7.\n\nAt the same time, the country started to formulate its National Adaptation Plan (NAP),\nwith technical and financial support from the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The activities carried out so far include\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 58\nclimate vulnerability assessments, cross-sectoral consultation workshops and the\ndefinition of criteria to prioritise adaptive measures.\n\nAdaptation has also been gradually integrated into the main national and sectoral\nplanning instruments, including the Strategic Development Plan \"Terra Ranka II\", the\nMaster Plan for the Agricultural and Rural Sector (PDSAR) and the National Plan for\nIntegrated Water Resources Management (PNGIRH).\n\nThe table below presents progress on Adaptation Policy and the Strategic Framework.\n\nTable 13: Progress in the Adaptation Policy Framework and Strategy\n\nInstrument\n\nProgress\nNDC (Nationally Determined\nContribution)\nThe 2021 NDC integrates adaptation commitments across\nwater, agriculture, forests, coastal areas and health.\nPreparations for the submission of the second version\n(updated NDC) are in progress.\nPAN (National Adaptation Plan)\nIn the formulation phase, with the support of UNDP/UNEP in\nthe framework of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) Preparation\nprogramme, vulnerability diagnostics and sector prioritisation\nworkshops were held.\nSector Adaptation Plans\nThey include the Agricultural and Rural Sector Master Plan\n(PDSAR), the National Plan for Integrated Water Resources\nManagement (PNGIRH) and the National REDD+ Strategy .\nThese documents incorporate adaptive goals and actions.\nIntegration into Development\nPolicies\nIntegration of adaptation into national plans (Strategic and\nOperational Plan – Terra Ranka II) is underway, especially in\nthe areas of resilient agriculture, renewable energy and\ncoastal management.\n\nOver the period under review, Guinea-Bissau has implemented a number of adaptation\nmeasures in priority sectors such as agriculture, water, coastal areas, biodiversity, health\nand gender. Interventions were carried out at both community and institutional level, with\nthe aim of reducing climate vulnerability and increasing the resilience of human and\necological systems.\nIn addition to the description of the actions, measurable progress has been made, with\nemphasis on the following indicators:\n Resilient Agriculture:\n +1,600 farmers trained in agroecological practices and sustainable use of\nwater;\n Implementation of 12 solar irrigation systems in arid areas of Oio, Cacheu and\nGabú.\n Water Resources Management:\n Rehabilitation of 23 holes and construction of 10 new community water points;\n Coastal Protection and Ecosystems:\n Rehabilitation of 981 ha of wetlands and mangroves (Coastal Project);\n Raising awareness among 54 coastal communities on climate risks and naturebased solutions.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 59\n Education and Gender:\n Inclusion of climate change issues in the curriculum of 32 basic education pilot\nschools;\n Support for 135 women in climate cooperatives with access to microfinance for\nresilient activities.\n\nThese data demonstrate not only the scope of the actions, but also the concrete positive\nimpacts on people's lives and ecosystems. One of the main lessons observed is the\nimportance of community participation and the integration of adaptation into local and\nsectoral policies. The continuity and scaling-up of these actions depends, however, on\nthe mobilisation of additional funding and the consolidation of institutional capacity.\n3.9.

Implementation of Projects and Actions on the Ground\n\nAt the operational level, Guinea-Bissau implements a number of projects that directly\ncontribute to climate adaptation. One of the most emblematic is the Coastal Project which\naims to protect coastal areas and subsistence farming. This project promotes actions\nsuch as the rehabilitation of protection dykes, reforestation of mangroves, installation of\nirrigation systems and formation of communities in climate resilient agricultural practices.\n\nAnother strategic project is the Early Warning Project which aims to strengthen national\nclimate information and early warning systems. With funding from the Green Climate\nFund (GCF), the installation of new meteorological stations, the strengthening of the\nNational Directorate of Meteorology and the technical training of national experts in\nclimate modelling and forecasting are under way.\n\nOther initiatives include the Functional Literacy Programme focussing on climate\nresilience, targeting women and youth in the most vulnerable areas, and the WACA\nProject, with interventions focused on integrated coastal zone management and erosion\nreduction.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 60\nIn the energy sector, the country is betting on the promotion of solar energy as an\nadaptation strategy, guaranteeing energy supply in remote communities and reducing\nvulnerability to climate shocks.\n\nThe table below shows the status of the Implementation of Adaptation Projects and\nConcrete Actions.\n\nTable 15: Implementation of Projects and Concrete Actions of Adaptation.\n\nProject/Programme\nSector\nActions in progress\nFinanciers\nCoastal Project\nCoastal areas and\nagriculture\nDam rehabilitation, mangrove\nreforestation, support for resilient\nagriculture and water security\nGEF, UNDP\nQuick Alert Project\nMeteorology and\nresilience\nStrengthening of climate\ninformation systems, installation\nof weather stations, early warning\ntraining\nGreen Climate\nFund, UNDP\nFunctional Literacy\nProject\nGender and local\nresilience\nFunctional education for women\nand youth, focussing on\nsustainable agriculture and\nadaptation to climate change\nCoastal\nWACA Project\nCoastal\nmanagement\nStrengthening the resilience of\ncoastal communities and\nprotecting against erosion\nWorld Bank,\nUEMOA\nSolar Programme for\nResilience\nEnergy\nPromotion of solar panels in rural\nareas as an energy resilience\nstrategy\nUNDP, Ministry\nof Energy\n\n3.9.2. Advances in Governance, Monitoring and Evaluation\nGuinea-Bissau created and operationalised the National Committee on Climate Change\n(CNCM) responsible for coordinating the implementation of climate policies, including\nadaptation actions under the NDC and the future PAN. This committee is inter-ministerial\nand also includes representatives of civil society, the private sector, universities and\ntechnical partners.\nThe Monitoring, Reporting and Verification System (MRV) for Adaptation is under\ndevelopment, with methodological proposals for data collection, definition of indicators\nand institutional coordination arrangements. This system will be essential to measure\nprogress and report to UNFCCC international mechanisms.\nIn addition, efforts are being made to integrate climate data from various institutions,\nimprove the technical capacity of the National Environment Institute (INA) and the\nNational Institute of Meteorology (INM) and digitise the databases of historical series and\nprojections.\nThe table below presents the governance, monitoring and evaluation framework.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 61\nTable 16: Governance, Monitoring and Evaluation Framework\n\nComponent\n\nCurrent status\nCreation of the NCCC (National\nCommittee for Climate Change)\nIt works with inter-ministerial representatives, NGOs, civil\nsociety and the private sector.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF ADAPTATION MEASURES AND\nPROCESSES IN GUINEA-BISSAU\n\nGuinea-Bissau is currently in a process of structuring and gradual operationalisation of\nits national MRV system, focussing on both mitigation (actions to reduce GHG emissions)\nand adaptation (actions, impacts and results). This process is driven by the commitments\nmade under the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of the National Adaptation\nPlan (NAP) and the preparation of the Second Biennial Transparency Report (BTR2) .\n\nThe table below shows the progress made so far in the adaptation process.\n\nTable 17: Progress made so far in the adaptation process\n\nComponent\n\nCurrent status\nInstitutional Structure\n✓ The National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC) was created,\nwhich leads the coordination of MRV actions.\n\n✓ Established a technical working group for MRV under BTR2.\nLegal and Regulatory\nFramework\n⚠ In development.

PREVENTING, MINIMISING AND DEALING WITH LOSSES AND DAMAGE\nASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN GUINEA-BISSAU\nGuinea-Bissau, as a small island developing state and a West African country with low\nadaptation capacity, is among the nations most vulnerable to the impacts of climate\nchange. Major threats include sea level rise, coastal erosion, flooding, prolonged\ndroughts, and changes in precipitation patterns, which significantly affect agriculture,\nfisheries, food security, public health, and basic infrastructure.\nTo prevent and minimise these impacts, the Government adopted several strategies. The\nupdated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) incorporates explicit commitments\nrelated to loss and damage management. Initiatives are underway, such as the Coastal\nProject (focused on community resilience and vulnerable coastal areas) and the WACA\nProject, which works on protecting against erosion and restoring coastal ecosystems.\nThese projects integrate preventive actions such as mangrove rehabilitation, community\nawareness, building resilient infrastructure and improving early warning systems.\nDespite these efforts, losses and damages are already felt in several regions. Coastal\ncommunities face forced displacement due to loss of land and housing; farmers suffer\nfrom unpredictable rainfall and crop failure; and unique ecosystems such as the Bijagós\nArchipelago are threatened. The institutional response still faces structural challenges,\nincluding weak cross-sectoral coordination, insufficient data, lack of adequate climate\nfinance, and lack of compensation mechanisms or insurance for losses and damages.\nGiven this scenario, the country recognises the urgent need to move forward with a\nnational mechanism for losses and damages that integrates the identification of risks, the\nquantification of impacts and the mobilisation of resources. Strengthening technical and\ninstitutional capacities, implementing robust monitoring and early warning systems, and\naccess to international funding, including the new Loss and Damage Fund established\nunder the UNFCCC, are also priorities.\nWith a focus on vulnerable communities and nature-based solutions, Guinea-Bissau is\ndetermined to protect lives, livelihoods and ecosystems by strengthening national climate\nresilience and contributing to a just and sustainable transition.\n3.12. COOPERATION, GOOD PRACTICES, EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS\nLEARNED ON CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN GUINEA-BISSAU\n3.12.1. Cooperation\nGuinea-Bissau has strengthened its response to climate change through strategic\npartnerships, implementation of good practices and continuous learning from local and\ninternational experiences. Cooperation with multilateral organisations, partner countries,\nand local communities has been essential to drive adaptation and mitigation actions.\n\nThe following table presents the list of National and International Cooperation\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 63\nTable 18: List of National and International Cooperation\n\nType of Cooperation\n\nInstitutions/Partners\n\nKey Contributions\nMultilateral Cooperation\nUNDP, FAO, GEF, GCF, World\nBank\nTechnical and financial support\nfor adaptation, resilience and\nstrategic planning projects\nRegional Technical Cooperation\nOMM, CILSS/AGRHYMET\nWeather data, early warning\nsystems, technical training\nBilateral Cooperation\nEU, German Cooperation\nFinancing of water infrastructure\nand institutional support\nConservation Partnerships\nMCRP, IUCN\nCoastal protection, ecosystembased management\nRegional Mechanisms\nECOWAS, WACA, CPLP\nIntegration into regional climate\nresponse networks and sharing\nof best practices\n\nGuinea-Bissau has accumulated relevant and promising experiences in climate\nadaptation, especially through pilot projects implemented in vulnerable areas and with\nstrong community participation. These best practices demonstrate local solutions with\ntangible impact on improving the resilience of livelihoods, infrastructure and ecosystems and\ncan serve as a model for scaling up and replicating on a national and regional scale.\n\nThe following table presents Implemented Best Practices.\n\nTable 19: Good Practices Implemented\n\nIntersection Domain\n\nGood Practices\nAgriculture and Food Security\nIntroduction of resistant crops, agroecological practices, consortia\nand agroforestry systems\nWater resources\nTanks, small reservoirs, National Plan for Integrated Water\nResources Management\nCoastal areas\nReforestation of mangroves, construction of adapted ramps,\ncommunity resource management\nEducation and Awareness\nClimate-focused functional literacy for women and youth in\nvulnerable areas\nMonitoring and Prevention\nStrengthening the early warning system, environmental\ndatabases, GIS in the INA and IBAP\n\n3.12.2. Experiences and lessons learned\nDuring the implementation process of climate actions in Guinea-Bissau, especially in the\nfield of adaptation, several relevant experiences have been accumulated. These\nexperiences have generated practical lessons that may be useful for other developing\ncountries, particularly small island states and West African countries with similar\nsocioeconomic and ecological characteristics.\n1. Integrating Adaptation into Local and Sectoral Policies\nLesson learned: Adaptation is most effective when integrated with local and sectoral\nplanning tools.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 64\nExperience has shown that the adaptation pilot projects with the greatest impact were\nthose that were linked to Local Development Plans (LDPs) and Protected Area\nManagement Plans. This increased local acceptance, facilitated the mobilisation of\nresources and reinforced sustainability after the end of projects.\n2. Community participation from the diagnostic phase\nLesson learned: Involving communities in designing and monitoring adaptation actions\nsignificantly improves their effectiveness and acceptance.\nDuring the Coastal Project, coastal communities were involved in identifying climate risks\nand nature-based solutions. This increased the relevance of interventions and reduced\nresistance. It also facilitated the appropriation and maintenance of results, such as\nmangrove plantations and drainage infrastructure.\n3. Importance of Technical and Institutional Capacity Building\nLesson learned: Investing in continuous training of national technicians and community\nactors is essential to ensure continuity and replicability of adaptation actions.\nIt was found that local technicians trained during the projects (e.g. water management,\nresilient agricultural practices, use of climate tools) became multiplier agents in their\nregions. However, in some cases, the high turnover in the public sector has compromised\nthe retention of knowledge.\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation: Gaps and Opportunities\nLesson learned: The absence of robust systems for monitoring the impacts of adaptation\nactions makes it difficult to assess progress and mobilise climate finance.\nDespite the implementation of several actions, such as mangrove rehabilitation or\npromoting resilient agriculture, the lack of harmonised impact indicators and real-time\ndata has compromised the ability to report results to technical and financial partners.\n5. Fragmented and Short-Term Financing\nLesson learned: The fragmentation of financial resources and the short duration of\nprojects limit sustainable impacts.\nMany adaptation projects in Guinea-Bissau operate with short funding (2–3 years),\nmaking it difficult to consolidate results. The dispersion of funding sources and the\ncomplexity of reporting requirements also overwhelm local capacities.\n3.13. ANY OTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE\nCHANGE AND ADAPTATION UNDER ARTICLE 7 OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT.\n\nArticle 7 of the Paris Agreement recognises adaptation as a global challenge with local,\nsubnational, national and international dimensions and is essential for protecting populations,\nlivelihoods and ecosystems . Guinea-Bissau, as a highly vulnerable country with low\nadaptive capacity, has sought to develop consistent actions to integrate adaptation into\nthe core of its national development planning.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 65\nGuinea-Bissau recognises that adaptation is a national priority and requires a strategic,\nparticipatory and coordinated approach.\n\nThe following table provides information related to the adaptation under Article 7 of the Paris\nAgreement in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nTable 20: Information related to adaptation under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement in GuineaBissau\n\nCategory\nDetailed description\nObserved impacts\n- Increasing frequency and intensity of seasonal floods (e.g.\nfloods in Bafatá, Gabu and Bissau in 2022-2024)\n- Increased salinisation of coastal soils and mangrove\ndegradation\n- Reduction of agricultural productivity - Decreased access to\ndrinking water in rural areas\nVulnerable Sectors\n- Agriculture and food security\n- Water resources - Coastal infrastructure - Public health -\nBiodiversity and fragile ecosystems (mangroves, estuaries,\nwetlands)\nLimited adaptive capabilities\n- Poor institutional and technical capacity to respond\n- Low availability of hydro-meteorological data - Insufficient\nfinancial resources - Poor integration of adaptation into sectoral\nand local policies\nNational Adaptation Priorities\n1.

NATIONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION, INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND\nCOUNTRY-DRIVEN STRATEGIES\n4.1.1. Economic situation of the country\nGuinea-Bissau's economy is recovering moderately following external shocks in recent\nyears. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has been growing steadily, with an estimated rate\nof about 4.8% in 2024, driven mainly by the agricultural sector, namely by the production\nand export of cashew nuts, which remains the main ecoNOmico engine in the country.\nDespite progress, the economy remains vulnerable. Inflation, which reached high levels\nin 2023, began to fall in 2024, nearing the goal of the West African Economic and\nMonetary Union (WAEMU). However, food and fuel prices continue to put pressure on\nthe cost of living.\nPublic finances face significant challenges, with high fiscal deficits and public debt\nexceeding 80% of GDP. Fiscal consolidation is underway, with the support of international\npartners, but depends on more efficient management of public revenues and\nexpenditures.\nThe current account deficit is structural, reflecting the country's strong dependence on\nimports and limited export base. The economic concentration in the primary sector,\nespecially in cashew, makes the country highly exposed to climate shocks and variations\nin international markets.\nInstitutional problems, such as political instability and corruption, continue to limit\ninvestment and the effectiveness of public policies. The economy is also hampered by\npoor infrastructure and the fragility of human capital.\nDespite these restrictions, the economic outlook is positive, provided that efforts to\nstabilise macroeconomic, productive diversification and structural reforms are\nmaintained. External support, good governance and political peace will be crucial to turn\nthe country's economic potential into concrete benefits for the population.\n4.1.2. Institutional Arrangement\nThe institutional architecture of Guinea-Bissau in the economic and financial field involves\nseveral key bodies:\nMacroeconomic institutions:\n- Ministry of Economy, Plan and Regional Integration : Development Plan, economic\npolicy coordination.\n- Ministry of Finance : Tax management, revenue collection, budget execution and control\nof public debt.\n- Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) : Responsible for monetary policy in the\ncontext of the WAEMU.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 67\n- National Institute of Statistics (INE): Production and dissemination of macroeconomic\nand social data.\nDevelopment support institutions:\n- Investment Promotion Agency (APIB) : Attraction of private investments.\n- Sectoral regulatory institutions, such as in the areas of energy, telecommunications,\nagriculture and environment.\nCoordination with international partners:\n- Close relations with the IMF, World Bank, ADB, UNDP, European Union, BOAD and\nother bilateral and multilateral partners that finance a large part of public investment.\n4.1.3. Country-orientated strategies\nGuinea-Bissau has been structuring a set of strategies and reforms to promote more\ninclusive and sustainable growth:\na) Development Strategies\n National Development Plan (NDP) 2025–2030 (under development): Aims at\neconomic diversification, improving infrastructure and creating decent jobs.\n National Economic Transformation Agenda prioritises value-added agriculture,\nrenewable energy, fishing and tourism.\n Programme for Modernisation of Public Administration and Tax Reform, focussing\non digitisation, transparency and control of spending.\nb) Sectoral Strategies\n Promote climate resilient agriculture through projects such as the Coastal Project\n, WACA and PNIA.\n Energy transition: investments in solar and renewable energy to reduce\ndependence on fossil fuels.\n Investing in sustainable value chains (rice, horticulture, fishing) to generate rural\njobs and food security.\n Promotion of the private sector and youth entrepreneurship with technical support\nand access to microcredit.\nc) Economic and Institutional Reforms\n Fiscal consolidation (cost containment, tax base expansion).\n Strengthening\neconomic\ngovernance\n(budget\ntransparency,\ncombating\ncorruption).\n Public-private partnerships for infrastructure (roads, ports, energy).\n Revision of the investment policy to attract foreign capital.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 68\n4.1.4. Systems and processes used to notify incoming and required support\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the monitoring and accountability of the support received and needed\nis ensured by a set of institutional mechanisms that are still in the consolidation phase.\nThe main instrument used is the Integrated System of Public Finance Management\n(SIGFIP), which allows the Ministry of Finance to register the support channelled through\nthe State Budget. However, much of the support continues to be managed outside the\nbudget, making it difficult to obtain a complete and integrated view of external aid.\nIn addition to SIGFIP, there are Project Management Units (PMUs) in the different sectors\nthat monitor and report the funding received, based on the needs of donors. These units\nproduce periodic technical and financial reports, but the integration of this information into\nnational systems is still limited.\nThe country also has structures such as the Directorate-General for Cooperation and\nthematic coordination mechanisms, which collect information on funding needs and\nsupport received, especially in the areas of climate and international cooperation.\nHowever, the use of digital tracking systems is still incipient, and manual tools such as\nExcel spreadsheets are often used.\nDespite progress, challenges remain such as institutional fragmentation, low digitalisation\nand weak integrated analysis and reporting capacity. Therefore, strengthening\ninterinstitutional coordination and implementing a unified national monitoring support\nsystem is a strategic priority to improve transparency, the Plan, and effective resource\nmobilisation.\n4.1.5. Difficulties and challenges in monitoring and reporting the support needed\nand received\nGuinea-Bissau faces several structural and operational challenges when it comes to\neffectively monitoring and reporting the financial support needed and received, both in\nthe context of development aid and climate finance.\nOne of the main obstacles is institutional fragmentation. Different ministries and project\nmanagement units operate in a relatively isolated manner, with little coordination and\nsystematic sharing of information. Much of the support received is managed outside the\nState Budget (off-budget), making centralisation and transparency of data difficult.\nAnother significant challenge is the lack of a unified national digital system that allows the\nautomatic and real-time recording of the funds received and the needs expressed. In\nmany cases, data is manually collected and shared using Excel spreadsheets, scattered\nreports, and ad hoc communications.\nThe limited technical and human capacities in the responsible institutions, namely the\nDirectorate-General for Cooperation, the Ministry of Finance and the sectoral technical\nunits, represent an additional obstacle. There is a lack of resources, training in monitoring\nand reporting systems, as well as standardised methodologies for classifying, validating\nand communicating support.\nThe lack of specific tools for monitoring climate finance, as well as the difficulty of\ndistinguishing between new finance and the reuse of old funds, undermines the quality of\nreporting to international bodies such as the UNFCCC or the OECD.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 69\nFinally, institutional instability and frequent turnover of technicians and decision makers\ncompromise the continuity of processes and the institutionalisation of good practices.\nThese challenges undermine not only the effectiveness of resource mobilisation, but also\nthe country’s credibility with international partners. Overcoming them requires\ncoordinated reform, focused on digitisation, capacity-building, and harmonisation of\nmonitoring and reporting mechanisms for foreign aid and climate finance.\n4.1.6. National priorities and strategies of Guinea-Bissau\nGuinea-Bissau has defined the achievement of sustainable, inclusive and climate resilient\ndevelopment as a strategic priority. At the national level, the country is committed to\nintegrating adaptation and mitigation objectives into ecoNOmico development policies,\nwith a focus on poverty reduction, food security, environmental preservation, and\ninstitutional strengthening.\nKey national strategies include:\n- Promoting resilient and sustainable agriculture that ensures food security and the\nlivelihoods of rural communities;\n- Protection of coastal and marine ecosystems through projects such as the WACA and\nthe Coastal Project;\n- Expanding renewable energies, especially solar energy, to improve access to energy\nand reduce dependence on fossil fuels;\n- Improving the management of natural resources and protected areas with community\nparticipation;\n- Strengthen climate governance, including Climate Plan, Finance and Transparency\nmechanisms.\n4.1.6.1. Aspects of the CDN that require support\nIn its updated CDN, Guinea-Bissau reaffirms its commitment to the Paris Agreement by\ntaking mitigation and adaptation measures, with objectives conditioned on the\nmobilisation of financial, technological and international support.\nMitigation\nThe country is committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 30 per cent by 2030\n(conditional). The focus is on:\n- Energy transition (investments in solar energy, improvement of energy efficiency);\n- Sustainable forest management and reduction of deforestation;\n- Treatment and recovery of waste.\nSupport needs:\n- Financing of renewable energy infrastructure;\n- Technologies for waste management and clean energy;\n- Transfer of knowledge about MRV (measurement, reporting and verification).\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 70\nAdaptation\nAdaptation is a top priority, focussing on:\n- Agriculture and food security;\n- Integrated water management and combating coastal erosion;\n- Resilience of communities vulnerable to climate impacts.\nSupport needs:\n- Technical and financial support for climate-smart agriculture;\n- Coastal protection projects (green and grey infrastructure);\n- Strengthening early warning systems and climate monitoring.\nMeans of implementation\nThe CDN specifies that almost all conditional goals can only be met with outside support,\nincluding:\n- Additional, predictable and long-term climate financing;\n- Transfer of green technology adapted to the local reality;\n- Institutional and technical training in Climate Plan, transparency, governance and\ncommunity participation;\n- Support for the operationalisation of the National Strategy for Low Carbon Development\ncurrently under formulation.\n\n4.2. INFORMATION ON THE NECESSARY FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO\nDEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 9 OF THE PARIS\nAGREEMENT\n\n4.2.1. Financial support needed\n\nThe NDC of Guinea-Bissau estimates that the costs of implementing the mitigation\ncomponent will be approximately US$ 664 million during the period from 2021 to 2030, of\nwhich US$ 531 million, or 80% of the total investment needs, are financial support needs\n(conditional element of the NDC). The sectoral breakdown of financial support needs is\ndetailed in Table 90 below.\n\nTable 21: International financial support needs to implement the updated NDC (Mitigation\nComponent)\nSectors\nValue in millions of US dollars in 2021\nEnergy\n240\nForests and Land Use\n264\nAgriculture\n22\nWaste\n5\nTOTAL\n531\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 71\nThere is no information available on the methodological approach to estimate the costs\nof implementing NDCs.\n\nGuinea-Bissau will strive to report more robust information on financial support needs in\nthe upcoming BTR, noting the upcoming development and adoption of NDC3.0.\n\nGuinea-Bissau needs to mobilise financial support from the GEF/UNEP, worth an\nestimated US$ 1,233,000, for the preparation and presentation of the Second Biennial\nTransparency Report (BTR2) and the Third Biennial Transparency Report and Fifth\nNational Communication (BTR3/NC5).\n\nFind CTF support needs in the attachment, in Excel format.\n\n4.2.2.

INFORMATION ON SUPPORT FOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND\nTRANSFER REQUIRED AND RECEIVED BY DEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTIES\nUNDER ARTICLE 10 OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT\n\nGuinea-Bissau is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, which occurs in\nthe form of temperature and precipitation changes and the occurrence of intense and\nfrequent extreme weather events (droughts and floods).\n\nThe negative impacts of these events are already being felt in the water, coastal and\nagricultural sectors. These sectors are classified as vulnerable to climate change in the\nTechnology Needs Assessment (TA) process; in the 2006 PANA; as well as in the NDCs\ndocuments.\n\nWithin the NCA, Guinea-Bissau has selected and prioritised nine (9) climate adaptation\ntechnologies: three (3) for the Agriculture sector; three (3) for the Water Resources sector\nand three (3) for the Coastal Zone sector, which express the necessary support in terms of\ntechnology transfer:\n\nFor the Agricultural Sector: 1st - Reforestation by communities (mangroves, fast-growing\nspecies, etc.); 2nd - Hydroagricultural projects; and 3rd - Use of seeds of short-cycle varieties\nand\n\nFor the Water Resources Sector: 1st - Hydrological and Piezometric Observation Networks;\n2nd - Irrigation Dam; and 3rd - Water retention infrastructure for various purposes.\n\nFor the Coastal Zone Sector: 1st - Reforestation of coastal vegetation; 2nd - Mapping of\nareas at risk of flooding and erosion using the Geographic Information System (GIS); and\n3rd - Construction / improvement of dykes.\n\nThe selected and/or prioritised technologies are aligned with the country's development\nstrategy to ensure that natural resources continue to provide the goods and services on\nwhich the country's continued well-being and progress, as well as adaptation to climate\nchange, depend and will serve as the basis for the other stages of the ANT process, i.e.\nBarrier Analysis, Technological Action Plan Development and project concept notes.\n(see link: https://tech-action.unepccc.org/country/guinea-bissau/ )\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 79\n4.4.\nINFORMATION\nON\nCAPACITY-BUILDING\nSUPPORT\nREQUIRED\nFOR\nDEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTIES UNDER ARTICLE 11 OF THE PARIS AGREEMENT\n\nThe training needs for the implementation of the NDC were detailed in the respective\ndocument.

INFORMATION ON THE SUPPORT NEEDED AND RECEIVED BY DEVELOPING\nCOUNTRY PARTIES FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE PARIS\nAGREEMENT AND TRANSPARENCY-RELATED ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CAPACITY\nBUILDING RELATED TO TRANSPARENCY.\n\n4.5.1. Support received from GEF/UNEP for the preparation of NC4 and BTR1\n\nGuinea-Bissau has received financial support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF),\nimplemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), for the preparation of\nits First Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1). This funding, worth 600\n1,000 U.S. dollars, was awarded through a comprehensive multi-country project. The project\nstarted in February 2023, is expected to last 24 months and the report is expected to be\ndelivered on January 1, 2025.\n\nThe preparation of BTR1 Guinea-Bissau is based on the findings and recommendations of\nits previous National Communication (NC) and Biennial Update Report (BAR), including the\nresults of the International Review and Consultation (ICA). The greenhouse gas (GHG)\ninventory included in BTR1 represents an improvement over the inventory presented in the\nprevious LU.\n\nGuinea-Bissau has received financial support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF),\nimplemented by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), for the preparation of\nthe Fourth National Communication (NC4). This financing, for a total amount of 500,000 US\ndollars, is valid for a period of 36 months (October 2022 to May 2025).\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 83\nUnder these projects, the country has benefited from UNEP's technical monitoring, including\ntraining and capacity-building sessions on IPCC tools and guidelines, etc., conducted by Mr.\nAlphonse MUTABAZI - Programme of Enabling Activities | GEF Climate Mitigation Unit.\n\nThis effort reflects Guinea-Bissau's continued commitment to strengthening the transparency\nand accuracy of its climate actions, aligning with the requirements of the Paris Agreement\nand contributing to global climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n4.5.2. Lusophone Cluster Support for Transparency\nThe Lusophone Cluster on Transparency is a triangular platform (south-south, north-south\nand south-north) for cooperation, sharing of information and experiences, training and\ntechnical assistance on climate transparency, in Portuguese, implemented by UNDP Climate\nPromise, with funding from the Government of Belgium; by the Partnership for Transparency\nof the Paris Agreement, funded by the Government of Germany, and by CBIT-GSP, funded\nby the GEF.\nThe Lusophone Cluster has provided fundamental support to Guinea-Bissau in its efforts to\nproduce transparent climate information, in particular this BTR.\n\nSupport is provided through many mechanisms, including in-person and online regional\nseminars with all Portuguese-speaking countries; remote assistance and in-person training\nand technical assistance.\n\nRegional Seminary\n\nGuinea-Bissau was represented by two experts deeply involved in the preparation of BTR1\nat the 7th Face-to-Face Seminar of the Lusophone Cluster dedicated to the debate on \"The\nrole of transparency in increasing the ambition of climate action: the link between BTR and\nthe NDC\".\n\nThe seminar aimed to encourage the exchange of experiences between Portuguesespeaking countries and increase their respective capacities to respond effectively and\nefficiently to the results of the Global Stocktake (GST). To this end, the seminar aimed to\narticulate, through a careful and rigourous Plan, the work of preparing the first Biennial\nTransparency Report (BTR) and the review of the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)\n- considering the mitigation and adaptation components - as well as, where applicable, the\ndevelopment and approval of the Long-Term Strategy (LTS).\n\nAs one of the most advanced countries in this regard, Guinea-Bissau made a presentation\non the steps taken for the preparation of BTR1.\n\nTraining and technical assistance in the country\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 84\n\nThe Lusophone Cluster on Transparency offered two two two-week training and technical\nassistance sessions in Bissau, in August 2024 and January 2025, both with the participation\nof about 20 specialists from different ministries and institutes, all involved in the preparation\nof the BTR and/or National Communication.\n\nThe first training The objective of the training was to develop the capacity for the elaboration\nof a transparent BTR1, focussing on the national GHG inventory, taking into account the\nspecific circumstances of each country. The training aimed to ensure that specialists\nacquired in-depth knowledge of ETF MPGs, including the CRT and CTF tables. The focus\nwas on GHG inventory, including the use of the IPCC GHG Inventory Software. However, in\nparallel sessions, relevant training and qualification was offered for the preparation of the\nremaining chapters.\n\nThe structure, content and use of the flexibility clause in this report were largely determined\nby the lessons learned during the training. The country’s ability to meet the deadline, clearly\nset by the Minister of Environment, was also made possible, in large part, thanks to the\ndetailed work plan and recommendations presented by the Lusophone Cluster at the end of\nthe intense work week.\n\nThe second training and technical assistance carried out in January 2025, after the\nsubmission of the mandatory chapters of the BTR, aimed to prepare the country for the TER\n- Technical Expert Review.\n\nThe training included a presentation on MPGs for TER, including key milestones and\ntimelines, and the flexibility offered to developing countries that need it. Expert support was\nalso provided in the preparation and execution of simulations of TER presentations. This was\nfollowed by a simulation of the presentation of the review week and question-and-answer\nsessions.\n\nA detailed cross-check of the consistency between NIR and CRT was performed.\nFinally, support was provided for the completion of the required and received support\nchapter, which was sent along with a compiled BTR file.\n\nBetween the two weeks of support in the country, the Lusophone Cluster provided extensive\nremote support including through the revision of successive versions of the NIR and the\nchapter on NDC.\n\n4.5.3. Other support\n\nUNFCCC Regional Workshop on IPCC Software Usage\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 85\n- UNFCCC Regional Workshop in Praia, Cape Verde (April 2023): In April 2023, the city of\nPraia, Cape Verde, hosted a regional practical training workshop organised by the UNFCCC\nExpert Advisory Group (CGE). The event focused on reporting information on climate change\nimpacts and adaptation, including the support needed and received in relation to adaptation\nreporting. While specific details about Guinea-Bissau’s participation are not available in\npublic records, it is common for countries in the region, including Guinea-Bissau, to send\nrepresentatives to events of this nature to strengthen their capacities on climate transparency\nreports.\n\n- Regional Workshop on Capacity Building in Africa to Accelerate Preparation for BTR; Togo,\nLomé, 9-11 August 2024\n\n- IPCC Workshop in Baku, Azerbaijan (September 2024): From 4 to 6 September 2024, the\nIPCC held a workshop in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the participation of experts from\napproximately 100 countries. The goal was to improve the use of IPCC inventory software\namong potential users and to promote the dissemination of IPCC methodologies. GuineaBissau participated actively in the event.\n\n- Regional Workshops on Article 6 and Carbon Pricing in Praia, Cape Verde (OctoberNovember 2024): From October 29 to November 1, 2024, the UNFCCC, in collaboration with\nthe Regional Collaboration Centre for West and Central Africa (RCC WAC Africa) and the\nWest African Alliance for Carbon Markets and Climate and Finance, organised a regional\nworkshop in Praia, Cape Verde. The event brought together key stakeholders, including\nrepresentatives from government, the private sector and international development\nagencies, with the aim of deepening understanding of the operational aspects and\nrequirements of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, as well as promoting regional dialogues on\neffective carbon pricing strategies. Guinea-Bissau was represented, given its interest in\ncarbon market mechanisms and regional cooperation.\n- Regional workshop held in Windhoek, Namibia, from 27 to 31 January 2025. This event\nwas organised by the secretariat of the UNFCCC in collaboration with the IPCC and the\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).\nCHAPTER 5: INFORMATION ON FLEXIBILITY\n5. Introduction\nGuinea-Bissau, as a non-Annexe I Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and a developing country with limited capacity, used the\nflexibility provisions set out in the relevant GMP paragraphs (decision 18/CMA.1). This\nchapter presents the flexibilities applied, the reasons for its use and how transparency was\nguaranteed in its application.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 86\n5.1. Legal and institutional basis for the use of flexibilities\nThe use of flexibilities is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities\nand respective capabilities, recognising national circumstances and the technical and\ninstitutional limitations faced by the country.\nGuinea-Bissau has institutional capacities still in the process of consolidation in the climate\nsector, which justifies the need to apply certain flexibilities, namely with regard to the\nidentification of key categories, complete time series, uncertainties and continuous\nimprovement of inventories.\n5.2. Implementation of the flexibility provisions of the GMP\nThe table below summarises the flexibility provisions used, as permitted by MPG:\nTable 27: Application of flexibility mechanisms according to MPGs.\nReference in MPG\n(Decision 18/CMA.1)\nFlexibility Provision\nApplication of\nGuinea-Bissau\nJustification\nParagraph 25\nIdentification of key\ncategories only for\ninventory start and\nend year\nApplied\nThe country’s technical and\ndata capacity does not allow\nfor detailed interannual\nanalyses.\nParagraph 29\nUse of less stringent\nmethods for emission\nestimates\nApplied\nHuman resources and\nlimited data justify the use of\nstandard emission factors\n(IPCC Level 1).\nParagraph 37\nAbsence of full time\nseries since 1990\nApplied\nThe national data series\nstarts in 2010 due to the\nunavailability of reliable\nhistorical data.\nParagraph 57\nUncertainty estimates\nprovided qualitatively\nApplied\nThe lack of quantitative data\nprevents the application of\nstatistical analysis of\nuncertainty.\nParagraph 74\nContinuous\nimprovement limited\nto priority areas\nApplied\nPriority given to sectors with\nhigher emissions and more\naccessible data.\nParagraph 32\nEstimates of\nemissions and\nremovals presented\nfor specific\ngeographical areas\nNot applied\nGeographical segmentation\nof estimates is not yet\npossible due to the absence\nof disaggregated data and\nregional reporting systems.\nParagraph 45\nSending complete\ninformation on\ninternational transfers\nof mitigation results\n(ITMOs)\nNot applied\nGuinea-Bissau does not\ncurrently participate in\nmechanisms or market\ntransactions involving\nITMOs.\nParagraph 64\nComplete reports on\nsupport received at\nall levels (financial,\ntechnology and\ntraining) with robust\nmethodology\nNot applied\nThe country is still in the\nprocess of structuring a\ncomprehensive system for\ntracking the support\nreceived and needed.\nParagraph 70\nComplete information\non progress in CDN\nNot applied\nLimitations in the definition\nof indicators and data\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 87\nimplementation with\nquantitative\nindicators\ncollection prevent the full\napplication of this\nrequirement.\n5.3. Transparency in the Application of Flexibilities\nEven with the application of the flexibilities, Guinea-Bissau sought to maintain the maximum\npossible transparency, explaining clearly:\n- The reasons for each flexibility applied;\n- The impacts of these flexibilities on the comparability and integrity of data; - Strategies to\nprogressively overcome these limitations, based on the strengthening of technical and\ninstitutional capacities, through international cooperation and technical assistance.\n5.4. Path to Continuous Improvement\nGuinea-Bissau recognises that the use of flexibilities is a transitional measure. It therefore\nundertakes to:\n- Strengthen national climate monitoring systems;\n- Develop a more robust national inventory system; - Expand technical training of national\nexperts; - Create and maintain accessible and reliable databases.\nCHAPTER VI – IMPROVING REPORTING OVER TIME\n6. Introduction\nContinued improvement of national climate reports is one of the pillars of the enhanced\ntransparency framework of the Paris Agreement. Guinea-Bissau recognises that as a Least\nDeveloped Country (LDC), the progressive development of technical and institutional\ncapabilities is essential to ensure the quality, comprehensiveness and regularity of its climate\nreports.\nThis chapter presents the main improvements made in the reporting processes, from the\nNational Communication and the Biannual Update Reports (BURs), to the present Second\nBiennial Transparency Report (BTR2).\n6.1.

Methodological and Technical Improvement\nGuinea-Bissau has gradually adopted the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for GHG emission\ninventories. Key improvements include:\n- Adoption of Tier 1 methods with greater precision and consistency;\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 88\n- Use of regional emission factors adapted to the reality of West Africa;\n- Improved systematisation of activity data in the agriculture, land use and forestry and waste\nsectors;\n- Technical training of more than 70 national technicians in MRV, GHG accounting,\ntransparency and climate finance.\n6.3. Institutional and governance improvements\nBetween 2020 and 2025, remarkable progress has been made in the institutional framework\nfor climate communication, including:\n- Strengthen the National Commission on Climate Change (CNMC) as a coordinating body;\n- Strengthen the capabilities of the National Environment Institute (INA) as a technical focal\npoint for inventories and MRV;\n- Better coordination between the Ministry of Environment, the Institute of Biodiversity and\nProtected Areas (IBAP), the Directorate-General for Agriculture, the National Institute of\nStatistics and other sectoral bodies.\nCONCLUSIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe preparation and presentation of the First Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) is a key\nmilestone in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau's commitment to the implementation of Article\n13 of the Paris Agreement on the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ERF). BTR1\nrepresents a strategic step in the institutionalisation of a national monitoring, reporting and\nverification system (MRV) and marks a qualitative leap in the national climate reporting\nprocess.\nAn updated inventory was developed, covering the period from 2010 to 2022, with greater\nmethodological rigour and sectoral coverage. The Energy, Agriculture, Land Use, Forestry\nand Land Use Change (AFOLU), Waste and Industrial Processes sectors were reviewed\nand updated in accordance with the 2006 IPCC guidelines.\n\nThe inventory shows a general trend of increasing GHG emissions, driven mainly by\nagricultural expansion, fossil energy consumption (particularly diesel) and pressure on\nforests and mangroves.\nThe total national GHG emissions in GgCO2eq in Guinea-Bissau, without LULUCF, in 2010\nwere 2,095.6 GgCO2eq; in 2015, 2,440.5 Gg CO2eq and in 2022, 3,449.7 Gg CO2eq. This\nrepresents a progress rate of 64.62%. If this trend continues, the sector will emit 4,809.46\nGgCO2eq by 2030 and reach 11,037.86 GgCO2eq in 2050.\nThe total national emissions of Gg CO2 eq in Guinea-Bissau with LULUCF in 2010 are 25122.2 Gg CO2 eq; in 2015 they are -19294.8 GgCO2 eq and in 2022 they are -19095.0 Gg\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 89\nCO2 eq . If this trend continues, by 2030 the sector will emit -15903.56 GgCO2 eq and reach\n-10067.72 GgCO2 eq in 2050.\nBetween 2010 and 2022, national GHG emissions show an increasing trend. In fact,\nemissions increased from 2,075.3 GgCO2eq in 2010 to 2,848.5 GgCO2eq in 2022, an\nincrease of 37.26%, without LULUCF. If this trend continues, by 2030 national GHG\nemissions will be 3,518.09 GgCO2eq, and by 2050, they will reach 5,963.92 GgCO2eq.\nIn the Energy sector, between 2010 and 2015, emissions increased from 233.0 GgCO2eq to\n309.2 GgCO2eq, an increase of 32.62%. From 2015 to 2022, emissions increased from\n309.2 to 458.2 GgCO2eq, representing an increase of 48.22%; in total, from 2010 to 2022,\nemissions almost doubled, with a cumulative increase of 96.6%.\nFor the LULUCF sector, emissions decreased from -27217.8 GgCFO2eq in 2010 to -22544.7\nGgCO2eq in 2022, a reduction of -17.16%.\nFor the Waste Sector, emissions increased from 124.8 GgCO2eq in 2010 to 229.5 GgCO2eq\nin 2015 and rose to 228.1 GgCO2eq in 2022. Between 2010 and 2022, waste emissions\nincreased by 130 per cent.\nNational emissions have a general upward trend between 2010 and 2022, with an average\nannual rate of increase of 8%.\nGuinea-Bissau remains a modest net emitter globally, but faces serious domestic\nenvironmental sustainability challenges. The dependence on biomass (firewood and\ncharcoal) and the pressure on forest ecosystems are the main drivers of emissions. Despite\nmitigation efforts, the rate of deforestation and soil degradation still exceeds the natural\nregeneration capacity.\n\nBTR1 assesses progress in the implementation of Guinea-Bissau's NDC, highlighting\nconcrete mitigation actions in the renewable energy, forestry and sustainable agriculture\nsectors. Moderate progress was observed in the implementation of the proposed measures,\nwith emphasis on investments in solar energy, mangrove restoration and pilot projects for\nresilient agroecology.\n\nIndicators show that, despite the challenges, there are consistent efforts to meet emissionsreduction commitments by 2030, although they still rely significantly on external support.\n\nBTR1 presents a systematisation of the adaptation measures implemented between 2020\nand 2024, including community capacity building, building resilient infrastructure (nurseries,\ndrilling holes, dykes) and protecting coastal areas.\n\nGuinea-Bissau has made progress in integrating adaptation into national and sectoral plans,\nsuch as the agriculture, water, health and biodiversity sectors. Areas of critical vulnerability\n(coastal, insular and estuarine zones) were identified, with an urgent need for prevention and\nresponse actions to losses and damages.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 90\n\nThe report documents efforts mobilised with international partners, including the Global\nEnvironment Facility (GEF), UNDP, the Green Climate Fund and the European Union.\n\nThere are still large funding gaps to cover mitigation and adaptation actions, with an\nestimated need of hundreds of millions of dollars by 2030. Challenges persist in technology\ntransfer and access to modern monitoring systems, particularly in the fields of remote\nsensing, climate data and land management.\n\nThe country reinforces the need for technical and financial support to continue improving\ndata quality and expanding mitigation measures.\n\nThe institutional and technical capacity is still limited, with a deficit of qualified human\nresources and fragility of the national systems for collecting, analysing and reporting data.\nThe development of BTR1 was made possible thanks to an inclusive and participatory\nprocess involving sectoral ministries, academia, civil society and development partners. The\ncountry has made progress in structuring a National Climate Transparency Unit, and the\ndesign of a National Integrated MRV/ETF System is underway.\n\nThe lessons learned and the gaps identified in BTR1 will improve the preparation of the next\nbiennial reports and improve the monitoring of national climate goals.\nSTRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Strengthen international technical and financial support to ensure the continuity and\nimprovement of the climate transparency system.\n2. Consolidate the National MRV/ETF System, with a clear definition of institutional\nmandates, data flows and responsibilities.\n3. Prioritise structural investments in adaptation, especially in high-risk areas such as\ncoastal and island regions.\n4. Develop continuous training plans, focussing on technical training in inventories, climate\nmodelling and reporting.\n5. Promote greater inter-institutional coordination to ensure coherence in the\nimplementation and reporting of NCDs.\n\nFirst Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1) - Guinea-Bissau\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action 91\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES\n1\nOil Products Import Yearbooks, DGE/DSDP; Ministry of Finance\n2\nParis Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015) – Establishes the global adaptation target and\nestablishes guidelines for vulnerable countries to implement climate resilience measures.\nAvailable at: https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\n3\nRegional Analysis of Climate Vulnerability in West Africa - Case of Guinea-Bissau.\nNiamey: AGRHYMET Regional Centre; CILSS/AGRHYMET (2020).\n4\nFAO Yearbook (2000 to 2022)\n5\nSupporting Coastal Ecosystem-Based Adaptation in West Africa: Lessons and\nExperiences from Guinea-Bissau.

In order to achieve\nthe above, the following interventions will be\nneeded: (i) in the transport sector, blockages will be\neliminated (rehabilitation of Bissau port and urban\nroads, priority inland waterways and inland\nwaterways); (ii) in the energy and water sector, a\nmajor turnaround is needed by developing 90 MW\nby 2020 and significantly improving access to safe\ndrinking water and sewerage / sanitation facilities;\n(iii) in the digital system, the digital system needs to\nbe transformed into a true growth lever for the\neconomy as a whole; and (iv) in land management\nand urban development, it is necessary to renovate\nand build urban centers in order to provide them\nwith functional infrastructure and systems and\nestablish them as epicentres of economic activity.\nIn this context, the priorities are based on the\ndevelopment of the Bolama-Bijagós Archipelago\nand the five main urban centers.\n\nThe Human Development Axis\nThis Axis aims to enhance the potential of the\nGuinean population, to ensure that their basic\nneeds are met, to implement a social safety net and\nto\ndevelop\ntheir\nskills,\nproductivity\nand\nemployability. This requires investing in: (i)\neducation and employment; (ii) health; (iii) social\nprotection for large-scale poverty reduction\nthrough the creation of both a safety net and real\nempowerment opportunities for the poor; and (iv)\nculture, youth and sports that will be especially\nbearers of a major cultural renewal.\n\nThe Simplification of Business Sector and Private\nSector Development axis aims to implement an\nenabling environment for the private sector. It is\nabout creating favourable conditions for the\nflourishing of the private sector, which is essential\nfor the development of investments and the\npositioning of the engines of growth. Business\nscope\nsimplification\nrevolves\naround\nthree\nprograms: (i) development of a conducive and\ncoherent national legal framework; (ii) business\nscope reform; and (iii) implementation of integrated\neconomic platforms with the creation of a\nmultisectoral Special Economic Zone in Bissau.\n\n6.2.2 Climate Mitigation in the context of national sustainable development objectives\nand plans\nThe cost benefit of mitigation resulting from\nnational sustainable development objectives and\nplans has not yet been estimated. The country is\nworking on this. Even so it is expected that:\n― By increasing the percentage of protected areas\nfrom 15 to 26%, according to the National Protected\nAreas Strategy the capacity of carbon sinks will\nincrease and hence the national effort to tackle the\ndamaging impacts of climate change. It will\nstrengthen the country's existing capacity to\nparticipate in the REDD + mechanism in accordance\nwith the Cancun and Warsaw framework as a way\nof receiving funding for efforts to reduce\ndeforestation and forest degradation, forest\nconservation and management, and increase of\ncarbon stock.\n\n― In its most recent planning, the Government\nemerging from the last democratic elections of\nApril 2014, has proposed for the energy sector a\nprominent role in its ten-year strategic and\noperational plan “Vision Guinea-Bissau 2025-Terra\nRanka”. In essence, the Administration envisages\ninvestments for the reinforcement and extension of\nthe 90 MW power plant by 2020. These investments\nwould be combined with others, such as those for\nthe\nimplementation\nof\na\nnational\nenergy\ntransmission grid. On the other hand, as part of its\nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy, NPRSP II\n(2012), the country has programmed investments\nfor the power system to increase its installed\ncapacity by 60%. In both the first and the second\ncase, the planned investments did not specify the\ntypology of the energy sources to be used for the\n\n103 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nstrengthening of electricity production, and it is\ntherefore understood that such investments are\nmainly concerned with fossil fuel power generation,\nie diesel and fuel oil.\n\n6.2.3 Climate adaptation in the context of national sustainable development objectives\nand plans\nAs with mitigation, the cost-benefit of adaptation at\nnational level has not yet been estimated. Similarly,\nit is expected that by increasing the percentage of\nprotected areas from 15 to 26%, the capacity of\nnational ecosystems to adapt will certainly increase\nby enhancing soil protection against water and\nwind erosion and protecting the coast against sea\nlevel rise and other types of erosion. It should be\nnoted that Guinea-Bissau has a considerable\ncoastline (approximately 300 km) where the vast\nmajority of the population lives, and much of the\ninfrastructure, equipment and major economic\nactivities are in place and practiced in this coastal\narea.\nThe Project on resilience and adaptability of the\nagricultural sectors to climate change in GuineaBissau did the cost-benefit analysis of adaptation in\nthe Gabu region, (taking into account the\ndevelopment trend baseline) and it shows that the\ncapacity of the Guinea-Bissau to adapt to climate\nchange will be low. Any endeavours that may exist\nwill most likely be through international initiatives\nand NGO efforts, both with scarce funding and\ninadequate\nmanagement,\nwith\nlittle\ndeep\ngovernment commitment due to lack of low\nfinances and weak institutional capacity.\n\nAlternatively, the country may have the capacity at\nnational and local levels to plan and implement\nmeasures to increase resilience to climate change.\nThis will be carried out within the framework of a\nclimate change resilience program, integrated into\nmultisectoral rural development and based on upto-date and accurate data and forecasts.\n\nAt national level, government agencies should\nassume a coherent leadership role within a strong\nlegislative and policy framework. The national\ngovernment should effectively allocate human and\nfinancial resources to agricultural and water\nmanagement for climate resilience. The national\ngovernment should be able to use greater capacity\nto absorb and attract climate-related funding from\nthe international realm. National administrative and\ntechnical agencies, in partnership with civil society\norganizations, can provide timely and accurate\ntechnical support to local governments and\ncommunities. This will be based on a sufficient\nunderstanding of climate change, climate variability\nand its implications through a prioritization process.\n\nAt local level, communities should identify and\nprioritize measures and undertake programs and\nprojects that incorporate livelihoods activities that\nreduce their vulnerability, in particular with respect\nto climate change and climate variability. This will\ninclude developing infrastructures as well as\nprotective measures such as good agricultural and\nwater management practices, tree planting, ceasing\nenvironmentally harmful practices, and further\ndiversification of environmentally and socially\nsustainable\nlivelihood\nactivities.\nCommunities\nshould also use their increased knowledge of\nclimate change to clearly articulate their demands\nwith local and national government, and to secure\nadditional funding for appropriate and effective\nactivities.\n\nLessons learned can be disseminated at local,\nnational\nand\ninternational\nlevels\nso\nthat\ncommunities can share best practices with other\nlocal communities. National policy integration\nprocesses that have successfully incorporated\nclimate change will be recorded so that they can be\nreplicated in other sectoral policies when new\nfunding becomes available.\n\n6.2.4 Climate Mitigation in the context of existing strategies and policies\nGuinea-Bissau has acceded to the UNFCCC\nCopenhagen Agreement with several dozen other\ncountries. The agreement promotes measures by\ndeveloping countries and industrialized countries\nto limit emissions in the medium term and the\nfinancing organization to take the necessary\nactions.\nAs\nthe\nprocess\nprogresses,\nthe\ncommitments of all countries (developed and\ndeveloping) to lower emissions, as well as the\nfunding frameworks, are recognized. Guinea-Bissau\nis currently seeking funding to draw up its NAMA\nStrategy and REDD + Strategy.\n\n104 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nThus, the forest in Guinea-Bissau plays an important\nrole in both adapting and mitigating climate\nchange. However, the view that the forest is a\nbalancing factor for the earth's ecosystems and\nprocesses and not just a natural resource to be\nexploited is not yet understood by policy makers\nand the population. In 2010 a diagnosis was made\nto lay the foundations for a new forest policy, but\nthe process was halted. The vision is for sustainable\nmanagement of forest resources - namely through\nthe conservation and restoration of forest heritage\n- to foster a socio-economic balance of meeting the\nneeds of communities and their accountability.\nProposed guiding principles include: biodiversity\nconservation,\nsustainable\nland\nmanagement,\nresearch and research and forest teaching,\nvalorisation of forest and wildlife resources that\nfavour economic development and environmental\nimprovement, promotion of agro-forest-pastoral\nmanagement, participation and communities’\naccountability in the design, implementation,\nmonitoring and evaluation of forest activities\nthrough decentralized management. However,\nforests continue to be heavily pressurized either by\ntraditional thinning practices for agriculture, slash &\nburn practice, charcoal production or by the latest\nrampant exploitation of forest resources and their\nlarge-scale commercialization (after the 2012 coup\nd'état).\n\nCapacity building for the implementation of Trade\nLaw, Governance and Regulation (FLEGT) is urgent.\nThis involves the elaboration of the forest inventory\nand forest management instruments with reserve\nareas and exploration areas for various purposes, in\nanticipation of massive reforestation. It should be\nnoted that the new government that came out of\nthe 2014 elections introduced a 5-year moratorium\nthat prohibits logging and timber exports. This will\nreduce pressure on forests and consequently\nnatural regeneration and restoration of forest\nheritage.\n\n6.2.5 Climate Adaptation in the context of existing strategies and policies\nGovernance in Guinea Bissau is based on\narticulation between the Central Government and\nRegional Governments. Regional governments\nhave very limited means to meet their obligations.\nSome Ministries have delegations in different\nregions. Aware of the fragility of the ecosystems\nand vulnerabilities that characterize the country and\nas part of the UNFCCC implementation, the\nGovernment of Guinea-Bissau has developed basic\ninstruments to prepare the country for possible\nadaptation measures. Thus, the Initial National\nCommunication, the National Climate Change\nAdaptation Action Program (NAPA), the Second\nNational Communication and the Third National\nCommunication were prepared.\n\nAwareness of climate change has progressively\nincreased among policy makers and the wider\ncommunity. Thus, the country through the National\nPeople's Assembly (ANP) ratified the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), the Convention on Biological Diversity\n(CBD) and the United Nations Convention to\nCombat Desertification (UNCCD) on October 27,\n1995.\n\nPalácio Colinas de Boé – Assembleia Nacional Popular\n\nAs part of its obligations, the country approved the\nNational Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan\n(December 2006), the National Biodiversity Strategy\nand Action Plan (Decree 3/2004 of 19 May) and the\nNational Action Program to Combat Drought and\nDesertification (2006 and a new PAN / LCD in 2011).\nThe country ratified the Kyoto Protocol through\nResolution No. 14 / PL / ANP / 2005 of 2 March,\nmaking a commitment to develop, update, publish\nand participate in the Conferences of the Parties\n(COP) national inventories of GHG emissions and\nremovals. Greenhouse Effect (GHG). It has already\nprepared three National Communications on\nclimate change and is preparing its BUR1.\n\n105 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nThere is absence of legislation related to land use\nplanning and town planning, ie there is no urban\nplanning. In the case of the General Regulations on\nConstruction\nand\nUrban\nHousing,\nclimate\nsafeguards are not yet included. These gaps make\nclimate change adaptation planning and climate\nrisk management difficult, as many of the decisions\nthat impact on the ability of the territory and society\nto adapt to the effects of climate change can be\nmade in spatial planning.\nThe national (political, strategic, institutional and\nprogrammatic)\nframework\nfor\ndisaster\nrisk\nreduction is under development. A National Civil\nProtection Service has been set up and a draft legal\ndraft has been prepared for the creation of the\nNational Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction\n(PNRRC) and a “National Strategy for Disaster Risk\nReduction” - both are to be analysis of the Council\nof Ministers. The National Risk Reduction Strategy\nincludes food insecurity, epidemics, extreme\nweather events, coastal erosion, fires but will have\nto first study vulnerabilities.\n\nThe Coastal Zone Master Plan, prepared in 1993\nwith the support of IUCN, was an important\nmilestone in the sustainable development of the\ncountry. The plan was aimed at the development of\nthe coastal zone, but also the conservation of\nnatural\nresources,\ncoastal\necosystems\nand\nbiodiversity. Following this plan, important actions\nemerged, such as the creation of the Orango, João\nVieira and Poilão, Cacheu, Cufada and Cantanhez\nnature parks and the Bijagos Biosphere Reserve\nproject.\n\n6.3 Presentation of current climate change adaptation initiatives and\nperspectives\nThe country's first exercise to pursue initiatives to\npromote the fight against climate change and longterm climate variability was carried out under NAPA\n(2006). According to NAPA (2006) it was possible to\ngauge the level of exposure of the sectors to\nclimate risks based on the sensitivity matrix analysis\nwhich showed that the sector with the highest\nexposure was agriculture with 57%, followed by\nlivestock and health both with 54%, followed by the\nfisheries with 51% and infrastructure with 46%.\n\nAgain as a result of the NAPA exercise, the\nidentification of particularly vulnerable social\ngroups was made possible on the basis of available\nsocio-economic\nindicators,\nparticularly\nthose\nprovided by the Light Poverty Assessment Survey\n(ILAP) and indications of the impact of climate\nchange on the sectors of activity acknowledged in\nthe process of preparation. Subsistence small\nfarmers were found to be the 1st most vulnerable\ngroup (54%), followed by livestock farmers (49%),\nwaged workers living in large cities (46%) and\nfishermen (34%).\n\nShort-term objective\nThus, in the context of information of this BUR 1, the\nnational short-term objective, was to implement the\nfollowing actions with the financial, technological\nand\ncapacity-building\nsupport\nfrom\nthe\ninternational community:\n― The already achieved increase in the percentage\nof protected areas from 15% to 26% and beyond\nensuring their management,\n― The effective implementation of the Forest Law\nand the moratorium on banning logging and\nexportation over the next five years;\n― Conduct a national forest inventory;\n―Develop agro-ecological zoning and forest\nmanagement;\n― Strengthen the existing capacity in order to\nparticipate in the REDD + mechanism and thereby\nincrease the national effort to tackle the damaging\nimpacts of climate change.\n― Enhance the adaptability of national ecosystems\nby enhancing soil protection against water and\nwind erosion and protecting the coast from rising\nsea levels and other types of erosion.\n\nMedium- and long-term objective\nIn the medium- and long-term Guinea-Bissau is\nconditionally committed, depending on financial,\ntechnological and capacity building support from\nthe international community stemming from the\nnew Climate and Green Fund Agreements to:\n― Develop a national reforestation and sustainable\nmanagement program for forest and agroforestry\necosystems by 2025;\n― Develop scientific and technical research on\nadaptation of new productive varieties with broad\nspectrum tolerance to the harmful effect of climate\nby 2025;\n\n106 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\n― Reduce illegal and indiscriminate logging by\n2030;\n― Foster forestry / plantation of species resistant\nto drought and low rainfall by 2030;\n― Develop\nan\nIntegrated\nCoastal\nZone\nManagement Program by 2025;\n― Implement 80% of renewable energy in the\nnational energy matrix by 2030;\n― Increase energy efficiency – by reducing energy\nlosses up to 10% over time by 2030;\n― Promote 80% of universal access to electricity by\n2030;\n― While a SIDS Member state, develop a Country\nClimate Change Vulnerability & Resilience Profile.\n\nThe long-term objectives\nThe long-term objectives are the introduction of\nclimate proofing in business sectors through\nestablishments / introduction of:\n― Short cycle drought resistant seeds;\n― Hydro-agricultural planning;\n― Introduction of culture techniques resilient to\nthe effects of climate change;\n― Introduction of fast-growing fodder plants for\nanimal feed;\n― Preparation of contingency plans for the\nmanagement of climate risks and natural disasters;\n― Rainwater harvesting and storage (water\nretention basins and mini dams) for dry season\nwater management;\n― Construction of grain and seed banks;\n― Infrastructures (roads, bridges, houses, etc.).\n\nCurrently and still taking into account the results of\nNAPA, the country is making efforts to implement a\nseries of projects and initiatives some already\nunderway or foreseen to be implemented in the\nnear future on the theme of climate change\nadaptation. Some of these initiatives are presented\nbelow:\n\n(i) Climate Change and Coastline Adaptation\nProject: Response to Coastal Change and Its\nHuman Dimensions in West Africa under Integrated\nCoastal Zone Management (ACCC). Following\nstudies carried out in the years 2000-2003 on the\ncontinent of Africa, during the African Process for\nthe Development and Protection of the Coastal and\nMarine Environment, the ACCC project emerged.\nThis process has chosen three priorities: coastal\nerosion, the impacts of climate change on coastal\nzones and the application of integrated coastal\nzone management.\nThe ACCC Project aimed to strengthen the\nadaptability of local communities and the resilience\nof the coastal ecosystems of the five West African\ncountries (Mauritania, Cape Verde, Senegal,\nGambia and Guinea-Bissau) to climate change. It\nhad as components:\n1. Implementation of pilot activities to enhance the\nadaptability and resilience of coastal ecosystems in\nareas vulnerable to the harmful effects of Climate\nChange;\n2. Integration of climate change and adaptation\nissues into coastal zone management policies and\nprograms.\n\n(ii) Adaptation and resilience building project for\ncoastal areas and communities vulnerable to\nclimate change in Guinea-Bissau (portfolio)\nIn partnership with UNDP and submitted to the LDC\nFund, the project aims to strengthen the resilience\nand adaptability of communities and coastal\ninvestments to the impacts of climate change. The\nproject has three main components:\n\n1. Enhanced policies, regulations, institutions and\nindividuals mandated to manage coastal zones to\nreduce the risks of climate change;\n2. Vulnerability of coastal investments to reduced\nclimate risks through the design, construction and\nmaintenance of coastal protection measures;\n3. Rural livelihoods in the coastal zone reinforced\nand protected from climate change impacts\n\niii) Stepping up smart agriculture in eastern\nGuinea-Bissau\n-\nScaling\nup\nclimate-smart\nagriculture in East Guinea Bissau (in portfolio). In\npartnership with the West African Development\nBank (BOAD) and submitted to the Adaptation\nFund, the project aims to strengthen farmers'\ncapacities for smart agriculture while enhancing\nadaptation\nand\nclimate\nrisk\nplanning\nand\nmanagement capacities at all levels of governance\nThe project also aims to solidify and broaden the\nactions developed by the project \"Strengthening\nresilience and adaptability of the agrarian and water\nsectors to changes in Guinea-Bissau\", from the 14\nintervention villages in the Gabu region to 26 in the\n\n107 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nGabu regions. and Bafata, with a total beneficiary\npopulation of 37,000. The project will address\nvulnerability in agriculture and water management,\nas\nwell\nas\ncontributing\nto\nthe\nlong-term\ndevelopment of resilience needs of extremely\nvulnerable farmers, with a particular focus on\nextremely vulnerable groups: women, the elderly\nand children. The project has three specific\nobjectives:\n1. Develop the technical and institutional capacity of\ngovernment and civil society (private sector, local\ncommunities and NGOs) to address the growing\nclimate risks in climate change adaptation planning;\n2. Increase the resilience of existing agricultural\nproduction\nsystems\nand\ncontribute\nto\nthe\ndiversification of production, notably through the\nimplementation of climate resistant actions such as\nwater management to minimize the risks of severe\ndroughts and floods;\n3. Promote the dissemination of lessons learned on\nknowledge of smart agriculture and adaptation\nplanning in other regions of the country, other West\nAfrican countries, and international climate change\nnegotiations and fora, including those of the\nUNFCCC.\n\nMain square in Bafatá with Amílcar Cabral bust, Bafatá, GuineaBissau8.\n\niv) Guinea-Bissau Resilience Project to Climate Change and Increasing Food Security (in portfolio)\nIn partnership with UNDP and FAO, it aims to develop and operationalize a National Agro-Ecological\nZoning System (NAEZ) to support decision-making in land use management, increased agricultural\nproductivity and reduced vulnerability to climate change. It is based on the fact that Guinea-Bissau's\neconomy is largely dependent on land and climate productivity, and mainly on rainfall patterns, and given\nthe predictions of climate change it is critical to prepare the country for adaptations in its agriculture to\nensure the food security of the population and make farming increasingly profitable and sustainable.\n\nColonial old town of Bafatá, the capital of Bafatá Region9\nPhoto credit: jbdodane\n\nThe system to be operationalized is based on plant\nproductivity models, data and maps already\ndeveloped by FAO to a coarse scale, but its practical\napplication\nin\nGuinea-Bissau\nrequires:\ni)\nparameterization of the main suitable crops\n(including\nbiofuels);\nii)\nsmall\nsoftware\ndevelopments; iii) construction of fine resolution\nspatial\ndatabases\nincluding\nmeteorological\ninformation; iv) data collection and soil mapping; v)\ntraining of technicians; vi) awareness raising and\nownership of information by farmers and local\nassociations.\n\n108 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\nAs main results, it is expected to set up a NAEZ\nsystem that produces high resolution maps for\nagricultural\nmanagement,\nproviding\ndecision\nsupport in the use of fertilizers and / or irrigation\nfor present climate and future climate forecasts. The\nsystem and the information it produces (including\nmaps) underlie field interventions by Agricultural\nExtension Services, local communities and other\nstakeholders. Interventions will be designed to\nincrease the resilience of local populations to\nincreases in rainfall variability and, at the same time,\nincrease productivity and return on agricultural\nproducts. This will reduce human pressure on\necosystems\nand\npromote\na\nreversal\nof\nenvironmental degradation phenomena.\n\n109 | First Biennial Update Report - Chapter 6: Additional Information\n\n6.4 References and Footnotes\n\n―\nAfrican Development Bank (2001a) Key issues in forestry sector to year 2020 in the West African\n―\nSustainable Agriculture in Guinea-Bissau Increasing Production. 2018. https://borgenproject.org/sustainableagriculture-in-guinea-bissau/\n―\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pu.html\n―\nProjecto de Dinamização dos Sistemas de Produção Pecuários nos Sectores de Pitche e Gabu BALAL\nGAINAKO (contrato DCI-NSAPVD 2010 / 257–105).

Executive branch: It is headed by the President of the Republic, elected by direct universal\nsuffrage, who exercises the functions of Head of State, guarantor of national unity and Supreme\nCommander of the Armed Forces. The Government, led by the Prime Minister, is responsible for\n\n19\n\nthe conduct of the country's general policy and public administration, consisting of Ministers of\nState, Ministers of State and Secretaries of State.\n2. Legislative branch: The National People's Assembly (NPA) is the supreme body of representative\nsovereignty, composed of directly elected deputies, with legislative powers, political oversight\nand approval of key governance guidelines and instruments of economic and budgetary planning.\n3. Judiciary: It operates independently and is exercised by the courts, with the Supreme Court of\nJustice as the highest instance. Regional courts, sectoral courts and specialised courts are also\npart of this power. The Supreme Judicial Council ensures the management and discipline of the\njudiciary.\nIn addition to the three traditional powers, there are control and supervisory institutions such as the Court\nof Auditors and the Ombudsman, as well as autonomous administrative bodies, including local\nauthorities, which have been gaining increasing importance in the context of administrative\ndecentralisation.\nGuinea-Bissau participates actively in regional and international cooperation mechanisms, being a\nmember of ECOWAS, the African Union, the CPLP and the United Nations, which influences the design\nand implementation of its national policies.\nThe country ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on 27\nOctober 1995 and also ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 18 November 2005 (IGEE, 2008), thus becoming\na contracting party to the Convention, committing itself to develop, update and publish the National\nCommunications on Climate Change and other strategic documents on the same topic and to participate\nin the Conferences of the Parties (COP). In order to comply with its reporting obligations, Guinea-Bissau\nhas already systematically prepared and presented: (i) The First Inventory and the National Initial\nCommunication in 1996, reference year 1994; (ii) The Second Inventory and the subsequent second\nnational communication in 2011, reference year 2000; and (iii) now the Third Inventory and,\nconsequently, within this framework, the reporting guidelines, adopted at COP 8 for the preparation of\nthe national communications of the Parties not included in Annexe I to the Convention and contained in\nDecision 17/CP. 8, were adopted for the preparation of this Fourth National Communication (reference\nyear is 2020), still guided by the Guidelines and/or Best Practices Guide of the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC) 2019 for the preparation of national communications of Parties not included\nin Annexe I to the Convention.\nIn the new organisational structure of the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC) is the governmental entity with the overall\nresponsibility for the development of environmental, biodiversity and climate action policies. The\norganisational structure for the implementation of the NC4 Project is presented in the scheme below.\n\n20\n\nFigure1Subject: Scheme of the institutional arrangements of the NC4 project\nThe National Environment Institute (INA) is responsible for the overall coordination and implementation\nof environmental policy across departments, programmes and projects in a centralised system, as there\nare still no regional offices. Given the NSI's limited resource capacity (human, material and financial)\nfor the effective implementation of its policy, it has received significant support from a number of\nnational and international partners, including: UNEP/GEF, World Bank (WACA Project), EU, IUCN and\noccasionally Wetlands International, etc.\nThe National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC), chaired by MABAC and involving a broad\nrepresentation of stakeholders, assumed the overall oversight and advisory role for the implementation\nof the NC4 project. The highest level of project structure is the Project Management Unit (PMU), which\nwas the highest decision-making body of the National Communication and provided general guidance\nand oversight.\n\nMINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT, BIODIVERSITY AND\nCLIMATE ACTION (MABAC)\n\nUNFCCC FOCAL POINT\n\nGEF OPERATIONAL FOCAL POINT\n\nPILOTAGE COMMITTEE\nOF THE NC4 PROJECT\n\nPROJECT COORDINATION UNIT NC4:\n\nNational Director of Projects (DNP)\nNational Project Coordinator (CNP)\nAdministrative and Financial Assistant (APA)\n\nGHG Inventory\nTeam\n1.

The population tends to focus on large cities in\nsearch of better services and infrastructure.\nAccording to demographic projections provided by the National Institute of Statistics (INS), in 2023, the\npopulation of Guinea-Bissau is 1,781,310 inhabitants; in 2030 it will be 2,053,620 inhabitants.\nThe average age in Guinea-Bissau decreased by 0.67 years between 2012 and 2023, from 18.97 to 18.30\nyears (median value).\nAbout 45% of the country's population lives in large cities. This growing trend of urbanisation is\nincreasing by 3.1% per year.\n\nFigure 2: Guinea-Bissau population pyramid\n\nPopulation growth is the result of birth rate, mortality rate and migration rate. Taking 2021 as an example\nin the chart: Guinea-Bissau's population increased by approximately 44,900. In the same year, the\nmortality rate was 8.7 per 1,000 inhabitants (~17,600 cases) and the birth rate was 31.1 per 1,000\ninhabitants (~62,700 births). Thus, approximately 200 inhabitants emigrated to other countries.\n\nOn average, 16,837 people have died each year in Guinea-Bissau in the last 10 years. The number of\nbirths was 62,885 per year.\nThe following chart compares the trends of births and deaths. All figures refer to births or deaths per\n1,000 inhabitants.\nPopulation projections for 2014-2060 estimate that by 2020 the population will be 1,678,768, reaching\n2,029,547 in 2030 (see table below).\n\n22\n\nTable 1-0-1Subject: Population projections 2014-2060\n\nYear\nOptimistic hypothesis\nTrend Hypothesis\nPessimistic hypothesis\nTOTAL\nMan\nWoman\nTOTAL\nMan\nWoman\nTOTAL\nMan\nWoman\n\n2020\n\n1,678,768\n\n800,620\n\n878,148\n\n1,682,149\n\n802,343\n\n879,807\n\n1,687,834\n\n805,237\n\n882,596\n\n2021\n\n1,709,219\n\n812,508\n\n896,712\n\n1,714,193\n\n815,041\n\n899,152\n\n1,721,865\n\n818,948\n\n902,916\n\n2022\n\n1,741,002\n\n825,168\n\n915,833\n\n1,747,193\n\n828,322\n\n918,871\n\n1,757,251\n\n833,446\n\n923,805\n\n2023\n\n1,774,143\n\n838,617\n\n935,526\n\n1,781,308\n\n842,267\n\n939,041\n\n1,794,039\n\n848,752\n\n945,287\n\n2024\n\n1,807,358\n\n852,199\n\n955,160\n\n1,816,449\n\n856,830\n\n959,620\n\n1,832,303\n\n864,905\n\n967,398\n\n2025\n\n1,842,016\n\n866,600\n\n975,416\n\n1,852,784\n\n872,084\n\n980,699\n\n1,872,115\n\n881,931\n\n990,184\nSource: INS, Nov-2022\nThe population of Guinea-Bissau consists of more than 20 ethnic groups, with different languages, social\nstructures and customs. The majority of the population lives on agriculture and professes local traditional\nreligions. About 45% practice Islam. The most widely spoken languages are Fulani and Mandinka, from\npopulations concentrated in the north and northeast. Other important ethnic groups are the Balanta and\nPapua on the south coast, and the Manjaco and Mancanha on the central and north coasts.\nThe population of Guinea-Bissau is currently predominantly rural; but this situation will be reversed\nfrom 2037 with an urbanisation rate of more than 50% (50.32%).\nThe population of Guinea-Bissau is predominantly rural. However, about 49.3% of the population of\nGuinea-Bissau lives in urban areas28 and, according to data on the population size of Guinea-Bissau,\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the number of urban residents is approximately 743,402. The current population\ndensity is 51.7 inhabitants per square kilometre as of April 2016. The city alone, with Bissau, the capital,\nhas more than 100,000 inhabitants, with an estimated population of 492,000 in 2015. Urban population\nconcentration also occurs in other major cities, such as Gabú (43,556) and Bafatá (34,760). In fact, the\npopulation of Guinea-Bissau's urban areas has grown at a considerable pace, and recent data indicate that\nurbanisation is 4.13%. This means that a considerable number of people are migrating to urban areas,\neither due to poor economic conditions and lack of employment opportunities in villages; and/or poor\nagricultural conditions and increasing population pressure on land. These are the main factors driving the\nexodus of the rural population to urban areas, testing, on the one hand, the capacity of urban centres to\nabsorb the incoming population and provide them with sufficient means of subsistence and, on the other\nhand, contributing to the steady decline in agricultural productivity.\n\n1.4 Profile Geography\nThe Republic of Guinea-Bissau lies on the west coast of Africa, between latitudes 11°-13°N and\nlongitudes 13°-17°W, bordering the Republic of Senegal to the north, the Republic of Guinea (also known\nas Guinea-Conakry) to the east and south, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. Its area is 36,125 km², of\nwhich only 27,700 km² are of land surface, due to the country's low altitude relative to mean sea level.\n\n23\n\nAdministratively, the country is divided into 8 regions and 1 autonomous sector: the Regions of Bafatá,\nBiombo, Bolama/Bijagós, Cacheu, Gabú, Oio, Quínara, Tombali and the Autonomous Sector of Bissau\n(SAB), which is the capital of the country. The regions are divided into sectors (36 in total) and these\ninto sections, consisting of villages (tabancas).\n\nNumber3Map of the administrative division and geographical location of Guinea-Bissau\nThe country consists of a continental part and an island that covers the Bijagós archipelago, consisting\nof about 90 islands and islets, of which only 21 are inhabited. In terms of geomorphological\ncharacterisation, three main areas can be identified: the western coastal zone, the central zone,\ncharacterised by gently undulating plateaus, and the zone of plateaus and hills of the Gabú region, in\nBoé.\nThe topography favours the existence of two areas of high potential for water production: the areas\ninfluenced by the tides (whose area can reach up to 150 km²) and the areas corresponding to the large\nbasins of the Geba and Corubal rivers, due to the great availability of surface water. Among the numerous\nrivers that cross the territory and the main accesses to the interior of the country, the Cacheu, the Mansoa,\nthe Geba and the Corubal stand out.\nThese features make the country highly vulnerable, especially to rising sea levels, floods, and the saline\nintrusion associated with climate change.\n1.5 Climate Profile\nThe climate throughout the year is mainly determined by the location of the territory in relation to the\nIntertropical Front (ITF) and by the subsidiaries of the semi-permanent high pressure cells, usually\ndesignated by Alto dos Açores, in the North Atlantic; Alto de Santa Helena, in the South Atlantic and\nalso by the low summer thermal pressure that settles over the Sahara.\nGuinea-Bissau's climate is humid tropical, characterised by an alternation between a monsoon-influenced\nrainy season and a Harmattan-ruled dry season. In the northeast, the climate is warmer, with low\n\n24\n\nhumidity, while in the south the climate is characterised by intense rainfall and lower temperatures.\nPrecipitation can reach levels in the order of 2,500 mm in the south, and in the north, the average\nprecipitation was recorded in the order of 1,400 mm. Since the 1970s, there has been a gradual trend of\ndeclining precipitation.\nThe climate is naturally determined by factors such as the influence of geography and three major\nclimatic phenomena, namely: i) the movements of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ); ii) the\nsubsidiary actions of semi-permanent high pressure cells, commonly referred to as Alta dos Açores in the\nNorth Atlantic and Alta de Santa Helena in the South Atlantic; and iii) the summer thermal depression\nthat settles over the Sahara desert. The country is divided between the mainland and small islands.\n1.5.1 Precipitation\nThe first rains normally occur in the second half of May, between 15 and 20 degrees Celsius. Currently,\nthe rainy season clearly begins in June, with intensity and regularity in distribution throughout the month.\nOctober marks the end of the rainy season, preceding the transition month, which corresponds to\nNovember.\nThe year can be divided into two distinct seasons:\n- Dry season: December to May (inclusive); and\n- Rainy season: June to November (inclusive).\nThe southern region of Guinea-Bissau has the highest rainfall. These indices decrease with latitude,\nwhich means that in the north the average rainfall is lower.\nThe average annual precipitation in Guinea-Bissau presents a great spatial variability, with values\nobserved between 830.0 mm and 1505.3 mm in the centre and north of the regions of Cacheu, Biombo\nand Oio. In the regions of Bafatá and Gabú, the observed values vary between 1289.7 mm and 1871.7\nmm. The values vary between 1661.5 mm and 2005.2 mm in the regions of Quinará and Bolama/Bijagós.\nOn average, about 80% of annual precipitation occurs during the months of July, August and September.\nThe maximum rainfall is reached in August, with a monthly average of more than 300 mm. The\nminimum, close to zero (0.0 mm), occurs during the months of December to April (dry season).\n\n25\n\nNumber4Subject: Distribution of average normal annual rainfall values (1991-2020)\n1.5.2 Temperatures\nTemperatures vary between 20.6°C and 39.7°C (monthly average: 30.2°C) in April and May, just before\nthe rainy season, between 21.7°C and 31.8°C (monthly average: 27.8°C) in August and September and\nbetween 16.4°C and 39.0°C (monthly average: 27.7°C) from December to March.\nThe average annual air temperature varies between a minimum of 25.4 °C in Bolama and 28.2 °C in\nBissau, and a maximum of 30.8 °C in Bafatá. The monthly average temperature values vary regularly\nthroughout the year, reaching a maximum in April and May and a minimum in December and January.\n\nNumber5: Distribution of normal values of mean temperature (°C) (1991-2020)\n\n26\n\nThe average values of the maximum temperature range from 35.5 °C in Bafatá (31.3 °C to 39.7 °C);\n32.8 °C in Bissau (30.5 °C to 35.0 °C) and 31.7 °C in Bolama (29.5 °C to 33.9 °C).\nThe average minimum air temperature varies between 19.7 °C in Bafatá (16.4 °C to 22.9 °C); 21.2 °C in\nBissau (18.6 °C to 23.7 °C) and 20.4 °C in Bolama (and 18.6 °C to 22.2 °C).\nFrom the point of view of temperature, the year can be clearly divided into four periods:\n1- Cold season: December, January and February;\n2- Hot period: March, April and May;\n3- Rainy season: June, July, August and September; and\n4- Second hot season: October and November.\n1.5.3 Climate variability\nThroughout the year, the climate of Guinea-Bissau is mainly conditioned by the situation of the\nmovements and impacts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in relation to the territory; and by\nthe subsidiary actions of the semi-permanent high pressure cells, commonly designated High of the\nAzores in the North Atlantic and High of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, as well as by the low\npressures of the austral summer, and also by the low summer temperatures that settle over the Sahara\nDesert. Changes in the behaviour of general air circulation systems, such as the anomalous ITCZ\noscillation or the increase in sea surface temperature (SST) that occurs when there is cooling in the\ntropical North Atlantic, and slight warming in the South Atlantic, in the Sahel region, in the West African\nregion and in the Southeast Asian region, in the Sahel region, where Guinea-Bissau tends to become drier\nwith decreasing precipitation.\nOn the other hand, human action to reduce vegetation cover, increase atmospheric carbon dioxide and\nair pollution in the northern hemisphere has also been pointed out as a cause of climate change in the\nSahel region and its surroundings, such as Guinea-Bissau. These changes are particularly noticeable in\nthe variability of precipitation, with delays in the first rains, increase in extreme precipitation events,\nreduction in the total and number of rainy days, appearance of dry periods in the middle of the rainy\nseason, strong winds, increase in temperature, increase in heat waves, decrease in the thermal amplitude\nwith the increase in the minimum temperature and the number of warm nights (with values oscillating\nby about 10% in some cases).\n1.5.3.1 Temperature variability\nThe highest temperature ranges are recorded in January and February, as well as in the first warm period\n(March and April), due not only to the fact that general winds alternate with warmer winds, but also to\nthe existence of frequent calms.\nTo these two factors should be added the low degree of cloudiness that favours nocturnal irradiation and,\nconsequently, the rapid decrease in temperature.\nEven during the rainy season, when the amplitude of the diurnal variations is low, a few clear nights are\nenough to register an immediate drop in the temperature.\nDuring the period of NORMAL CLIMATE 1991-2020, trends of maximum temperature increase are\nobserved in all representative synoptic stations of the three zones of the country: Bissau (Central and\nNorth Zone); Bolama (South Zone and Islands) and Bafatá (Eastern Zone), and a trend of sharp decrease\n\n27\n\nof minimum temperatures in Bolama (South Zone and Islands). These trends confirm projections for future\nclimate scenarios in Guinea-Bissau (see graphs below).\n\nNumber6: Maximum and Minimum Temperature Trends; 1991-2020 (Source: INM-GB Database)\n1.5.3.2 Precipitation variability\nThe average annual precipitation in Guinea-Bissau presents a great spatial variability, with values\nobserved between 830.0 mm/year and 1505.3 mm/year, in the Centre and North of the Regions of\nCacheu, Biombo and Oio. In the regions of Bafatá and Gabú, the observed values vary between 1289.7\nmm/year and 1871.7 mm/year. In the regions of Quinará and Bolama/Bijagós, the values vary between\n1661.5 mm/year and 2005.2 mm/year.\nThe southern region of Guinea-Bissau has the highest rainfall.

The average\nlife expectancy at birth in 2021 is only 59.7 years, per capita GDP is less than $900, population growth\nis 2.4%, and the fertility rate is 4.3 children per woman. Moreover, an estimated 21.7% of the population\nhas less than $1.9 billion in PPP per day, and almost 7.4% of children die before the age of five.\nThe economy of Guinea-Bissau is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in prices and production of\ncashew nuts (about 150,000 tons), which represents 80% of the country's exports mainly to India. The\nagricultural sector accounts for almost 35% of GDP, of which 10% is directly attributable to the cashew\nnut sector and represents 20% of budget revenue. In addition, the very significant fishing potential\nremains largely untapped. Guinea-Bissau also has the potential to extract bauxite and phosphate without\nany really active exploration project at this time. Thus, industry accounts for only about 15% of GDP.\nServices account for just over half of the country’s GDP.\nAfter reaching 1.5% in 2020, the GDP growth rate recovered significantly to 6.4% in 2021, according to\nIMF data, due to: (i) an increase in cashew nut production; (ii) public investments in essential\ninfrastructure (externally financed); (iii) the gradual lifting of restrictions and the improvement of\nbusiness confidence, which boosts private investment.In 2022, the growth rate slowed to 3.5%, affected\nby below-expected cashew nut exports and the consequences of the war in Ukraine (rising food and\nenergy prices).In the medium term, Guinea-Bissau is expected to achieve growth 4.5% in 2023, then\nstabilising at an average of around 5% per year over the period 2024-2027.\nThe standard of living measured by gross national income (GNI) per capita is $780 in 2022, with constant\ninternational dollars converted by purchasing power parity (PPP). Conversion rates have been steadily\nincreasing from 1,335 in 1990 to 1,552 in 2017 (UNDP, 2018). However, Guinea-Bissau's GDP per\ncapita, as an indicator of economic strength, reached 820 dollars in 2022 and went through a fairly stable\nperiod, from 614 dollars in 2010 to 620.21 dollars in 2016, which represents a GDP per capita equivalent\nto 3% of the world average.\nThe vulnerability of the economy is twofold. On the one hand, the strong dependence on agriculture\n(almost 60% of GNI), mainly on the cashew sector, the main source of export earnings, and on the other,\nthe long period of political instability.\n\nTable 1-0-2: Evolution of Guinea-Bissau HDI based on consistent data (Human Development Report,\nUNDP 2024)\n\nYear\nLife expectancy\nat birth\nEstimated\nduration\nEducation level\nAverage duration\nEducation level\nGNI per capita\n(2017 dollars in PPP)\nHDI\nValue\n1990\n47.1\n3.7\n-\n1,692\n-\n1995\n48.7\n5.2\n-\n1,713\n-\n2000\n50.4\n6.7\n-\n1,668\n-\n\n30\n\n2005\n52.3\n8.5\n2.3\n1,644\n0.403\n2010\n54.6\n9.9\n2.6\n1,739\n0.436\n2015\n57.0\n10.5\n3.2\n1,848\n0.464\n2016\n57.3\n10.5\n3.3\n1,916\n0.468\n2017\n57.7\n10.5\n3.3\n1,929\n0.470\n2018\n58.0\n10.5\n3.3\n1,945\n0.472\n2019\n58.3\n10.6\n3.6\n1,996\n0.480\nPPA – Part of Purchasing Power\n\nReal economic growth slowed to 3.5% in 2022, compared to 6.4% in 2021. This was due to disruptions\nin the supply chain and reduced demand and economic activity caused by measures and policies to\ncontain the pandemic. Inflation increased from 3.3% to 7.8% in 2021. The general government deficit\ndecreased from 5.5% of GDP in 2021 to 5.2% in 2022. Tax revenue was unchanged at 9.1%, equivalent\nto a ratio of wages to tax revenue of approximately 65.3%. On the expenditure side, total government\nexpenditure decreased slightly from 24.5% of GDP in 2021 to 23.3% in 2022. As a result, the public debt\nreached 80.2%.\nTable 1-0-3Subject: Macroeconomic indicators\n\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023 2024 E¹ 2025 P²\nReal GDP growth rate (%)\n4.80%\n3.80%\n5.60% 2.10%\n5.20% 4.40%\n4.60%\n5.10%\nReal GDP per capita growth rate\n(%)\n2.30%\n1.30%\n–0.2% 2.90%\n3.20% 2.10%\n2.30%\n—\nInflation (annual average, %)\n–0.2%\n0.40%\n0.30% 1.50%\n7.90% 7.20%\n3.80%\n—\nBudget balance including grants\n(% of GDP)\n–2.0%\n–3.8%\n–3.4% –8.8%\n–6.2% –8.2%\n–7.3%\n–3.4%\nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)\n–3.5%\n–3.5%\n(approx.)\n–8.0% –2.8%\n–8.0% –8.3%\n–8.5%\n–5.8%\n¹ 2024 (Estimate) — According to the World Bank: growth of 4.6%, average inflation of 3.8%, budget deficit of 7.3% of GDP\nand current account deficit of 8.5% of GDPworldbank.org.\n\n² 2025 (Projections/Forecast) — According to the IMF: projected growth of 5.1%, average inflation of 2%, budget deficit of\n3.4% and current account deficit of 5.8% of GDP.\n\nSources:\n\nIndicators 2018–2024: World Bank Selected Indicators Report thedocs.worldbank.org.\n\nProjections for 2025: IMF Report – Article IV Consultation, July 2025IMF.\n\nEconomic update and additional data (2024): World Bank overview – Guinea-Bissau worldbank.org.\n\n1.6.1 Emerging economic sectors\nThe country’s history of chronic political instability has led to a political discontinuity that poses a\nsignificant obstacle to reform. However, the reforms undertaken in the last three years have produced\nconcrete results, notably in terms of macroeconomic stabilisation and improved public financial\nmanagement. The newly established climate of peace allowed the economy to grow by 5.1% in 2015,\ncompared to 2.9% in 2014.\nThe vulnerability of the country's economy is twofold. On the one hand, the vulnerability of GuineaBissau's economy is mainly due to its dependence on agriculture (almost 60% of GDP), in particular the\ncashew nut industry, which is the main source of export earnings and a significant share of government\n\n31\n\nrevenues. On the other hand, Guinea-Bissau's economic depression is largely the result of a long period\nof political instability. Proof of this is that, due to the latest unrest in 2012, the country’s GDP contracted\nby 1.5%, according to the African Development Bank Group. To diversify its economy and promote\ngrowth, Guinea-Bissau must prioritise economic diversification if it is to increase its resilience to external\nshocks.\nIn fact, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and livestock accounted for 41.3% of GDP in 2023. This is\nfollowed by trade (19.3%), government services and manufacturing, each representing 10% of GDP.\nTable 1-0-4: Real GDP by sector (in million CFA francs at 2015 prices)\nGDP/Sector\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n2024\n2025\nPrimary sector\n297,481.4\n312,239.7\n328,071.9\n342,807.2\n358,854.8\n375,949.3\nAgriculture\n244,320.8\n257,714.4\n272,277.0\n285,635.8\n299,795.9\n314,922.6\nAgriculture other than fruit and cashew\nnuts\n147,926.7\n156,247.0\n165,736.3\n176,538.1\n188,079.8\n200,413.6\nCashew nuts and fruits\n96,394.0\n101,467.4\n106,540.8\n109,097.7\n111,716.1\n114,509.0\nBreeding and hunting\n27,254.7\n27,926.1\n28,472.8\n29,105.8\n29,757.1\n30,427.2\nFishing\n21,358.3\n21,997.3\n22,655.4\n23,333.2\n24,496.4\n25,718.7\nForest\n4,547.7\n4,602.0\n4,666.7\n4,732.4\n4,805.5\n4,880.8\n\nReal GDP growth rate (in %)\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\nPrimary sector\n1.8%\n5.0%\n5.1%\n4.5%\n4.7%\n4.8%\nSubsistence farming\n6.8%\n5.6%\n6.1%\n6.5%\n6.5%\n6.6%\nCashew nut\n-6.2%\n5.3%\n5.0%\n2.4%\n2.4%\n2.5%\nBreeding and hunting\n2.5%\n2.5%\n2.0%\n2.2%\n2.2%\n2.3%\nFishing\n6.5%\n3.0%\n3.0%\n3.0%\n5.0%\n5.0%\nForest\n1.8%\n1.2%\n1.4%\n1.4%\n1.5%\n1.6%\nSource: National Institute of Statistics (INS) of Guinea-Bissau\nGuinea-Bissau is among the countries most affected by climate change.

To attract private finance, the country needs to develop specific\nregulatory frameworks for climate finance, implement tax incentives, promote good governance, and\nbuild technical capacity.\n\n32\n\nNumber8Subject: Cumulative climate financing\nneeds of Guinea-Bissau, NDC 2020-2030\n\nNumber9Subject: Financing needs for\nmitigation by sector (in millions of US dollars)\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on OECD data\nSource: CDN (2021) Guinea-Bissau\n\n1.7 Energy\nGuinea-Bissau has a wide range of potential energy sources, including biomass, hydrocarbons,\nhydropower, solar energy, wind energy, bioenergy and ocean energy. Currently, all of them are\nunderdeveloped due to insufficient financial, regulatory and technical capacity. As a result, the country's\ncurrent energy capacity is extremely limited. Energy consumption in Guinea-Bissau is mainly based on\nbiomass (90%), petroleum products (8%) and electricity (2%). Biomass energy resources include wood,\ncharcoal and agricultural/forestry products. At the subsistence level, the collection and use of\nwood/charcoal for heating and cooking consumes huge biomass resources and labour.\nThe hydroelectric potential of Guinea-Bissau is high, but only 33.84 MW of hydroelectric capacity have\nbeen identified so far (including Saltinho (14 MW) and Cusselinta (13 MW)) in studies conducted in the\n1980s. Thus, the generation of electricity in Guinea-Bissau is excessively dependent on imported diesel.\nThis strong dependence of a non-oil producing country on energy imports (mainly petroleum products)\nis a significant factor with negative impacts on the economy. The first step to reduce the excessive\ndependence on fossil fuels with high import costs is the total replacement of diesel in the generation of\nelectricity by other cleaner sources.\nThe production system in Guinea-Bissau, both at regional and national level, are the OMVG energy\nproject dams and the Cusselintra and Saltinho dams in Guinea-Bissau. A 15 MW BOAD power plant\nand TAGs, wind turbines and solar power are also included in the project.\nEnergy Project of OMVG (Organisation for the Development of the Gambia River). Cusselintra and\nSaltinho hydroelectric power plants.\nAt the national level, the hydroelectric potential of Guinea-Bissau is estimated at a minimum of 300.91\nGWh, with a minimum power of 33.84 MW. This potential is necessary for the construction of two (2)\nhydraulic dams in Cusselintra and Saltinho, as well as transformed hydroelectric microdams. Thus, an\ninvestment of approximately 116,8 million GFCF is required for the construction of all these\nhydroelectric works. As regards the infrastructure development strategy, the hydroelectric (HA) projects\nof Cusselintra and Saltinho will be taken into account.\n\n33\n\nNumber10Subject: Target structure of the 225/63 kV transmission network in Guinea-Bissau (in 2025)\n– option 63 kV.\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau intends to implement programmes aimed at implementing an energy\nmodel based on economic rationality and sustainability, through, on the one hand, the combination of\nenergy efficiency measures and the use of energy from endogenous and renewable sources and, on the\nother, the reduction of additional costs affecting energy prices. At the same time, it is intended to reduce\nthe country's energy dependence and ensure security of supply, promoting a balanced energy mix.\nIn this sense, and in the implementation of the Government Programme and the Great Options of the\n2020-2030 Plan, \"It is a challenge for the future - The development of priority sectoral measures and\nobjectives\", in the part relating to the \"National Plan\" \"Action Plans for energy and energy policy\", the\nGovernment of Guinea-Bissau intends to pursue, among others, the following objectives:\n·Ensure the continuity of measures that ensure the development of a rational energy and economic\nmodel, that ensures the protection of sustainable energy and that does not compromise the\ncompetitiveness of companies in the quality of life of cities;\n· Ensure a substantial improvement of the country's energy efficiency through the implementation\nof the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) and the National Renewable Energy Action\nPlan(PANER). After the completion of its preparation, the government intends to strengthen the\ncoordination of programmes to support energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as\nsupport innovation and technology transfer.\nGuinea-Bissau is currently facing the challenge of improving access and energy security for its\npopulation while mitigating climate change. The unstable political and economic environment in GuineaBissau has affected the development of several sectors of the economy, including the energy sector. The\ncountry is currently trying to recover from its long period of instability.\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau, through the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Natural Resources\n(MEIRN), remains committed to the process of sectoral reorganisation and, at the same time, to the\n\n34\n\nimplementation of the policy for the energy sector, with a special focus on the energy sector. One of the\nconstraints that hinder the development of the energy sector is the difficult national/international financial\nsituation, marked by the scarcity of resources, thus imposing the need to adopt new strategies in the\nenergy subsector.\nRegarding energy resources, the country has the following potential:\n· Biomass energy: The amount of biomass mobilised from various agricultural waste for the production\nof solid fuels in Guinea-Bissau is estimated at 239,760 tons. There is a clear predominance of rice\n(35.4%) and cassava (34.8%) residues, followed by groundnut (12.4%) and sorghum (7%) residues. The\ncultural residues present low values <5%. The resulting energy production corresponds to a thermal\nenergy of 2,220,950 TJ (terajoules). With an average growth rate of 5%, the country’s cashew nut\nproduction is expected to increase from 171,000 tons in 2011 to 333,000 tons in 2025. Unfortunately,\nalmost all of this significant production is exported without processing – the country is the world’s largest\nexporter of fresh cashew nuts. If Guinea-Bissau were to process all its domestic cashew nut production,\nthe amount of cashew nut shell extracted would be 119,609 tons in 2011 (since the shell corresponds to\n70% of the cashew nut), which could have corresponded to 2.7 TJ of thermal energy if used as solid fuel\nfor energy production. At the same time, the country produces approximately 683,480 tons of cashew\npulp, of which only 30% is processed into fruit juice and brandy. The rest is discarded. If this percentage\ncould be transformed into ethanol, approximately 13,353 m³ of ethanol (CABIRA) would be generated.\n\n· Fossil fuels (oil, coal, natural gas): these resources have not been identified in the country despite the\nresults of research carried out so far, which give rise to some hope for the existence of oil in offshore\nareas;\n\n· Hydropower: The country has a very large river basin which, if properly exploited for energy purposes,\ncould contribute to closing the electricity deficit. In the study of the Energy Master Plan carried out by\nthe company CABIRA, using the SIMAHPP Professional software version 4.8, which was used to\nanalyse the sites selected by PAGIRE for the construction of dams for agricultural purposes, 19\nmicrodams were identified that can be used for the production of electricity, whose potential was\nestimated at 2.94 MW, with an expected annual production of 25.91 GWH. In addition to these, the study also\nidentifies: the production of electricity through the Tide-Motive and wave energy, whose potential is\nabout 4 MW, and an annual production of 35 GWH; and the dams of Saltinho, Cussilinta and Surire\n(fast), with an estimated power of 27 MW, which totals 33.94 MW and an annual production of 300.91\nGWH;\n\n· Solar and wind energy: As a tropical country, it benefits from a strong solar irradiation estimated at\n5.5 kW/m²/day and an average wind speed between 2.5 and 5.3 m/s. If these renewable energy potentials\nare exploited, Guinea-Bissau could reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and take advantage of\nclean development mechanisms (CDMs).\nIn the energy sector, the country should align its industrial policies with current trends and opportunities\nin the energy transition, exploiting its renewable energy potential (solar, hydroelectric, etc.) to address\nits significant energy deficit. Opportunities exist for the private sector, thanks to ongoing initiatives by\n\n35\n\ndevelopment partners, including the World Bank, which plans to install a 40-megawatt solar plant to\ncover the entire country. The contribution of the private sector is expected for the construction of\nproduction infrastructure. Likewise, BOAD established a credit line for SMEs operating in the\nrenewable-energy sector and installed two 1-megawatt hybrid mini-grid systems in Gabu and Cahungo.\nA 22-megawatt solar plant originally planned was suspended due to lack of funding, but could be the\nsubject of a public-private partnership once the country’s structure is well established. A regional\napproach to their exploitation can also help maximise their contribution to sustainable growth.\nTable 1-0-5Subject: Estimated final energy consumption (ktoe) in Guinea-Bissau.

However, it faces significant structural limitations that\naffect its efficiency, safety and environmental sustainability.\n1. Road transport: They are the main means of transport in the country, accounting for more than\n90% of passenger and cargo transport. The road network is extensive, but much of it is in poor\ncondition, with unpaved roads, vulnerable to erosion and torrential rains, which compromises\nthe connection between the regions, especially during the rainy season.\n2. Maritime and fluvial transport: They have great strategic importance, given the archipelagic and\ncoastal configuration of the territory. The port of Bissau is the main infrastructure for foreign\ntrade, but it needs modernisation and expansion to increase operational capacity. River navigation\n\n36\n\nremains an essential means for riverine communities, although limited by the lack of adequate\nvessels and local port infrastructure.\n3. Air transport: Bissau's Osvaldo Vieira International Airport is the only airport infrastructure of\nsignificant size, serving as a gateway for international air traffic. Secondary aerodromes exist in\nsome regions, but are underused and poorly maintained.\n4. Rail transport: The country does not have a rail system, which limits the alternatives for largescale freight transport.\nFrom an environmental point of view, the transport sector is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions, due to the almost exclusive dependence on imported fossil fuels and the predominance\nof old and low energy efficiency vehicles.\nNational priorities include:\n\nModernisation and maintenance of the road network;\n\nImprove maritime and port connectivity, including inter-island transport;\n\nImproving the safety and efficiency of air services;\n\nPromote sustainable transport and encourage the use of cleaner vehicles;\n\nDevelopment of policies to reduce dependence on fossil fuels through the progressive\nintroduction of clean and efficient technologies.\nStrengthening the transport sector is therefore essential not only for the socio-economic integration and\ncompetitiveness of the country, but also for achieving environmental and climate commitments in the\nfield of emissions mitigation.\n1.9 Industry\nGuinea-Bissau's industrial sector is still incipient and characterised by a low diversified production base\nand low technological capacity. Industrial activity is concentrated mainly in small and medium-sized\nunits, linked to the processing of agricultural and fishery products, the extraction of natural resources and\nartisanal production.\nKey industry features include:\n1. Agribusiness: Cashew nuts represent the main export product of the country, but most of them\nare exported in nature, with low national processing capacity. The modernisation and expansion\nof the cashew husking and processing industry are seen as strategic priorities to add value and\ncreate jobs.\n2. Fishing and fish processing: Despite the high potential, the fish processing industry is limited,\nwith few conservation and processing infrastructure, restricting the export of value-added\nproducts.\n3. Extractive industries: There are artisanal activities of extraction of sand, clay and other nonmetallic minerals, especially for the construction sector. The bauxite and phosphate farms are\n\n37\n\nidentified, but they are still in the preliminary stage of evaluation and do not represent a\nstructuring activity.\n4. Basic industries and manufacturing: The country has few manufacturing facilities, limited to\nsmall industries of beverages, soap, furniture, building materials, and local consumer products.\nFrom an environmental and climate point of view, the industrial sector contributes to greenhouse gas\nemissions mainly through fossil fuel-based energy consumption, the use of inefficient biomass and\ninadequate waste management.\nThe main national priorities for the industrial sector are:\n\nPromote the local processing of agricultural production, in particular cashew nuts and other\nagroforestry products;\n\nEncourage investments in sustainable, low-carbon and clean-tech industries;\n\nImprove energy and transport infrastructure affecting industrial competitiveness;\n\nStrengthen the regulatory framework and institutional capacity-building to attract investment and\npublic-private partnerships;\n\nDevelop industrial areas and supporting infrastructure to promote entrepreneurship and\ninnovation.\nStrengthening the industrial sector is seen as crucial to diversify the economy, create jobs and reduce\nexternal vulnerability, and should be aligned with the country’s sustainable development goals and\nclimate commitments.\n1.10 Waste\nIn the last thirty years, the city of Bissau has registered a strong population growth, which consequently\nled to rapid changes in both the magnitude and the formation of capital (for example, names, numbers,\nneighbourhood boundaries). The demographic composition and economic level of the population\ncontribute to determining the amount and type of waste produced in a given city. In the city of Bissau, as\nin most African cities, there has been a very high population growth rate, due, on the one hand, to the\nincrease in the birth rate and, on the other, to the phenomenon of urbanisation. This leads us to assume\nthat the amount of waste produced in the city of Bissau will increase in the same proportion as the\npopulation increases.\nCurrently, the amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) produced in Bissau is 316 tons per day and,\nconsidering the population growth and the maintenance of constant production levels, by 2025, the\nproduction of 395 tons of MSW per day will be reached. The estimated daily waste production per person\nis 0.6 kg/inhabitant/day.\nToday, we face obvious hygiene problems and the dispersion of large amounts of solid waste that the\nmunicipality has difficulty managing. Less than 30 per cent of the waste produced by the capital's\npopulation ends up in the city's landfills every day.\n\n38\n\nNumber11Subject: Problems with municipal solid waste in Guinea-Bissau\n\nMunicipal solid waste management (MSW) is the responsibility of the Municipality of Guinea-Bissau\n(CMGB), but the garbage collection service is limited only to the main blocks, or neighbourhoods, of the\ncity centre. In the neighbourhoods surrounding the city and in the regions that make up the country,\ncleaning, collection, treatment and final disposal depend almost exclusively on the voluntary action of\nyouth associations in each neighbourhood and the residents themselves. The absence or absence of urban\ncleaning services is the cause of several illegal landfills that have spread throughout the country. There\nis only one legal landfill declared by the CMGB for the disposal of any type of waste, and it is located in\na rural area near the capital.\nThe area where the CMGB dumps the waste has been carefully chosen. There's a large rural community\naround that lives off agriculture and fishing. It should also be noted the existence of a river around the\nlegal deposit. At this point, fishing in the area is already difficult, because all the manure (Figure 2A)\nthat leaves the deposit was thrown into the river, causing the death or escape of the fish (Figure 2B).\n\nNumber12: (A) Leachate from the CMGB legal landfill outside Safim. (2B)\n\nOpen disposal of waste can contribute to soil, air and water contamination and the spread of disease\nvectors.\n\nThe CMGB itself faces challenges in the collection and disposal of waste. In addition to the lack of\ntransport for collection (Figure 3), there is a huge difficulty in finding people willing to work in the\nmunicipal waste collection service, since the company itself has created labels to honour different\nservices (those that collect waste are not considered \"someone\" in Guinean society). Often, it is foreigners\n\n39\n\nwho provide the collection service or families (the pickers) whose income depends, in part, on the\nmaterials collected in the dumps.\n\nNumber13Transport: used for waste collection\nHowever, the adequate disposal of municipal solid waste remains the main challenge of the country,\ngiven that its careless disposal on land remains the most common, simple and economically \"viable\"\noption. All regions and communities of the country tend to use this simpler and more economical option,\nwhich is easily evidenced by the existence of illegal dumps and landfills that have spread everywhere\n(Figures 12 and 13).\n\nNumber14Market: Snail\n\nNumber15Subject: River water channel blocked\nby garbage in the Military District\nAccording to the International Association of Lay Volunteers (LVIA, 2016), in Bissau alone, 316 tons of\nMunicipal Solid Waste (MSW) are generated daily, with a per capita production of 0.6 kg of MSW /\ninhabitant / day. Although this production is far from the approximately 1.2 kg/inhabitant/day of Europe,\nits management is more complex due to the lack of infrastructure for waste treatment already mentioned.\nThis volume of waste is expected to increase to 394 tons per day by 2025. Of the amount of waste\ngenerated, less than 30% is collected and the remainder has an uncertain destination.\nIn rural areas, per capita production is lower due to social inequality and lower purchasing power, with\nwaste generated often being reused.\n\n40\n\nTherefore, it is very important that the country bets on strategies and structures that help regulate the\ndestination of the waste produced to minimise the negative impacts currently observed.\nAccording to LVIA (2016), in Bissau, organic waste represents the largest percentage (about 37%), of\nwhich about 7% is associated with pruning waste. These types of residues, together with the organic\nresidues of the sieves, present a greater potential for the composting process, as can be seen in Table 3.\nIn rural areas, although there are no studies on the quantification of municipal waste, there are also\norganic waste produced in large quantities, compared to other waste produced in the country.\nTable 1-0-6: Quantification of Municipal Solid Waste in the city of Bissau\nType of waste\nQuantity (in %)\nOrganic waste\nThe sieve remains\nGlass\nPaper/Cardboard\nSize\nPlastic\nMetals\nInert\nDangerous\n30%\n26%\n9%\n8%\n7%\n4%\n4%\n2%\n1%\nSource: LVIA, 2016\nAt present, the government of Guinea-Bissau is not taking any significant steps in relation to waste\nmanagement. This has resulted in widespread environmental degradation, a situation that urgently needs\nto be reversed.\nThe reversal of the environmental situation in Guinea-Bissau should involve not only the creation of\nspecific legislation in the area of waste management, but also the formal creation of effective control\nentities.\nCurrent waste recycling/reuse practices should continue to be encouraged, if possible with cleaner and\nmore up-to-date techniques, thus contributing to the implementation of the circular economy concept.\nComposting seems to be a suitable process to recover the organic fraction of organic waste, since it is\nrelatively simple to implement and ultimately produces a plant production factor, a compound that can\nbe used as a fertiliser due to its high nutrient content and its very low content of heavy metals. However,\nit will be necessary to encourage changes in the environmental attitudes of the population. The\ngovernment should also invest in environmental education, starting with primary schools.\n1.11 Real Estate Park and Urban Structure\nThe urban structure of Guinea-Bissau is characterised by a strong population concentration in the capital,\nBissau, and by a poorly planned pattern of urbanisation, marked by the spontaneous growth of peripheral\nneighbourhoods and the absence of adequate infrastructure. Urbanisation is advancing at an accelerated\npace, driven by rural-urban migration, but not accompanied by sufficient investments in basic services,\nhousing and sanitation.\n1. Real estate park:\n\n41\n\nThe housing deficit is estimated at more than 30% of national needs, with most informal and selfconstructed housing. About 65% of households use precarious materials (adobe, zinc, straw), especially\nin peri-urban and rural areas, increasing vulnerability to climate disasters such as floods, cyclones and\nstrong winds. The formal real estate sector remains small, with little supply of public or social housing\nfor low-income families.\n2. Urban structure:\nThe country's urbanisation rate is estimated at about 45% (ONU-Habitat, 2022), with more than a third\nof the urban population living in Greater Bissau. Other secondary cities, such as Gabú, Bafatá, Cacheu\nand Bolama, show slow growth and low economic attractiveness. The disorderly growth of urban areas\nresults in the occupation of risk areas (river banks, low-lying areas and mangroves), putting pressure on\necosystems and aggravating climate vulnerability.\n3. Urban infrastructure:\nOnly 38% of the urban population has access to clean water and less than 20% to adequate sanitation\nsystems. The electricity supply is irregular and affects about 30% of the urban population, with great\ndependence on diesel generators. Solid waste management is poor: more than 60% of municipal waste\nis not collected, resulting in open deposition, with risks to public health and the environment.\n4. Environmental and climate impacts:\nThe construction sector and the building stock contribute to greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of\nconventional materials (cement, uncertified wood, aluminium) and inefficient energy consumption. The\nlack of adequate urban planning and sustainable construction standards increases the population’s\nexposure to climate risks, including seasonal flooding and coastal erosion.\nNational priorities in this sector include:\n- Strengthen spatial planning and urban management to promote more resilient and sustainable cities;\n- Reducing the housing gap by promoting social housing and affordable finance programmes;\n- Integrate criteria for sustainable construction, energy efficiency and use of low impact local materials;\n- Improve urban access to water, sanitation, electricity and waste management;\n- Develop effective urban drainage systems to reduce flood risks;\n- Support the development of secondary cities, to diversify the growth poles and promote territorial\nbalance.\nSustainable and inclusive urban development is an essential condition for improving the quality of life\nof the population, reducing climate vulnerability and ensuring the resilience of communities to the\nimpacts of global change.\n\n42\n\nTable 1-0-7: Main indicators of the Real Estate Park and Urban Structure\nIndicator\nCurrent situation (estimate)\nSource/Note\nUrbanisation rate\n~45%\nUN-Habitat (2022)\nUrban population in Greater\nBissau\n>33% of the urban population\nNational estimate\nHousing deficit\n>30% of needs\nMinistry of Housing /\ntechnical estimates\nHousing in precarious\nmaterials\n~65%\nInformal sector and selfconstruction\nUrban access to safe drinking\nwater\n~38%\nUNICEF/WHO (JMP 2022)\nUrban access to adequate\nsanitation\n<20%\nUNICEF/WHO (JMP 2022)\nUrban access to electricity\n~30%\nDirectorate General for Energy\nMunicipal waste not collected\n>60%\nMunicipal estimate\nExistence of sustainable\nconstruction standards\nVery limited\nNot applied systematically\n1.12 Agriculture\nThe agricultural sector is the backbone of Guinea-Bissau's economy, providing a source of income for\n85% of the population. Agriculture plays an important role in the country's external accounts and\ntherefore has a significant impact on the macroeconomic stability of Guinea-Bissau. Agricultural exports\naccount for more than 98% of total exports of goods. The production and export of cashew nuts and rice\ncultivation are the main activities associated with extensive livestock farming. In 2012, the area\ncultivated with cashew was 223,000 ha, with a production of 130,000 tons of raw cashew nuts (FAO,\n2015). In 2013, cashew nut accounted for 87.7% of the country's total exports. The sector has grown\nsince the late 1990s, and now 85% of people living in rural areas depend on these orchards in some way\nfor their livelihood. This has led to a major economic improvement, but the lack of diversity involved in\nthis monoculture practice leaves citizens extremely vulnerable. If crops fail or are affected by disease,\nhundreds of thousands of citizens will be adversely affected.\nMost of the country's population is employed in low-productivity agriculture, focused on the production\nof cashew nuts, which has replaced rice production. Economic growth has stagnated since 2000 and\npoverty has worsened in the following years. In fact, poverty has increased in the last decade, in contrast\nto the regional situation. The social gap between Guinea-Bissau and its peers has widened more and\nmore, as social progress has stagnated over the past decade. Poverty is more prevalent in rural areas than\nin urban areas. The latest recorded estimate indicates that approximately 64.7% live in poverty on less\nthan $2 a day. The agricultural sector underpins the Guinean economy, a source of income for 85% of\nthe population. Agriculture plays an important role in the country's external accounts and therefore has a\nsignificant impact on the macroeconomic stability of Guinea-Bissau. Agricultural exports account for\nmore than 98% of total exports of goods. The production and export of cashew nuts and rice cultivation\nare the main activities associated with extensive livestock farming.\nThe country’s climate and soil allow for the cultivation of a wide variety of commercial crops, fruits,\nvegetables, and tubers; however, cashew nuts generate on average more than 80% of export earnings and\nare the main source of income for many rural communities.\n\n43\n\nThe impacts of climate change, such as increased droughts and floods in the future, will significantly\naffect the country’s key assets. The agricultural sector, which is less diversified and depends mainly on\nrainfall, will suffer greatly from the increased tensions resulting from uneven rainfall, rising temperatures\nand rising sea levels. The livestock sector will also be significantly affected by droughts.\nFuture climate conditions will have potential impacts, such as:\n- Loss of soil suitable for agriculture (continental and marine hydromorphic soils) due to salinisation and\nacidification (due to lack of rainfall) and intrusion of salt water (due to rising sea levels);\n- Reduction of crop yields by about 20-30%, mainly of vegetables, cereals (rice and basil maize), peanuts\nand cashew nuts, due to drought, high temperatures, poor distribution of rainfall and/or floods from\nlowlands for prolonged periods; one third (33%) of the population will be mired in food insecurity.\nCashew nuts are the main exported product. It undoubtedly accounts for more than 90% of total exports\nand about 17% of government revenues, making the economy vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations in the\nmarket price of cashew nuts.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, factors contributing to soil degradation include soil salinisation, forest fires,\nagricultural deforestation associated with itinerant agriculture, overgrazing, excessive use of firewood,\nwater erosion, and irregular and poorly distributed rainfall.\nTo realise its commitment to climate action, Guinea-Bissau has developed a series of policies to combat\nthe effects of climate change that have highlighted the need for a transition to green growth.\nTable 1-0-8: Policies and strategies for green growth in Guinea-Bissau\n\nPolicy/Strategy\n\nGreen growth priorities and objectives\nStrategic and operational plan 2015-2020\n\"Terra Ranka\"\nAxis III; Ensuring sustainable management of natural capital and\npreserving biodiversity\nStrategic and Operational Plan 2020-2023\n\"Chiga Time\"\nStrategic objective 6: Preserving biodiversity, combating climate\nchange and enhancing natural capital\nPNIA2 Agricultural Investment Plan (2017)\nSub-programme 7: Adapting the agricultural\nsector to climate change\nObjective: To promote food security and resilience in the\nagricultural sector and gender equality, in particular through the\ndevelopment of climate-friendly seed varieties, agricultural\ninsurance products that protect farmers and the exploitation of\nlocally adapted agroforestry systems.\nNationally Determined Contribution NDC\n2021\nTarget: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030. GuineaBissau's unconditional contribution corresponds to 10% or 1.8\nmillion tons of CO2 emissions compared to the baseline scenario of\n18.2 million tons of CO2 in 2020.\nSource: Official documents – authors compilation / Country Report, Guinea-Bissau 2023 (BOAD)\nThe country needs to move beyond subsistence farming to modern, large-scale agriculture, adapting to\nthe vagaries of climate change. To this end, the country must focus on the transfer of technology and the\nmechanisation of the production system, in order to guarantee food and nutritional security and\nsovereignty. Developing sustainable agriculture (short-cycle seeds and drought-resistant varieties) and\nusing climate-smart techniques, such as solar irrigation systems, would increase agricultural productivity\n\n44\n\nwhile preserving the environment. The private sector could also invest in the development of hydraulic\nworks, the construction of micro-dams and small water retention gates.\nAbstract: Agroecological zoning is one of the most important instruments to support agricultural activity,\nbased on knowledge of the potential and environmental vulnerabilities of a given region, especially the\nbehaviour and characteristics of climate, soil, vegetation, geomorphology, and with emphasis on the\nsuitability of the land for agricultural use. Although it is a priority of the Ministry of Agriculture,\nunfortunately the country has not yet managed to carry out its agroecological zoning at national level,\nwhat has helped so far have been specific actions, carried out more within projects such as the ACTIVA\nproject, in which the agroecological zoning was carried out in the regions of Bafatá, Quinará and Tombali,\nalso under PADES this activity is planned for some places in the regions of Quinará, Tombali and\nBolama, etc. Therefore, it can be considered that the measure taken was partially effective, due to its\npunctual implementation in some regions. The main obstacle to the effective implementation of this\nmeasure is the lack of internal capacity for its implementation. The implementation of this measure will\ncontribute significantly not only to agronomic gains, but also to put an end to the anarchic occupation of\nland intended mainly for cashew cultivation, where agronomic skills are not respected, and to reduce the\nfrequent conflicts between pastoralists.and farmers, mainly in the Oio, Bafatá and Gabu regions.\nLivestock farming\nLivestock represents 4.8% of GDP, with an estimated value of $51.389 billion in 2023, and constitutes\n32% of agricultural income. It is a fragile sector, exposed to infectious and parasitic diseases. The\nestimated average meat consumption is 7.7 kg/inhabitant/year, including 2.6 kg of beef and 3.4 kg of\npork. For milk, the estimated average consumption is 6 kg/person/year. Regarding livestock, the country\nis divided into 3 regions:\n•\nThe eastern part of the country, in the Gabu and Bafatá regions, concentrates most of the livestock\nactivity, with 74% of the national bovine herd, 54% of the sheep herd and 63% of the national\ngoat herd. The Fula (Peul), a Muslim people, constitute the main ethnic group, with the presence\nof a Mandinka minority in the Bafatá region. Their cattle-raising techniques are quite similar, and\nthe ownership and management of the herd are familiar.\n\n•\nThe Bissau region and its surroundings concentrate the vast majority of the population, while\nlivestock is limited to some more or less modernised poultry producers. This is the main\nmarketing area.\n\n•\nThe rest of the country, whose ethnic groups are predominantly animist (especially the Balanta),\nhas no livestock tradition, with a limited number of animals and meat rarely marketed, being used\nin ritual ceremonies (20 cows can be slaughtered during a funeral ceremony), with frequent\npractices of consuming dead animals. Herd management is collective (at village level). Pig\nfarming is predominant in this region. The northern region alone has significant percentages: 13%\nof cattle, 10% of sheep, 19% of goats and 46% of pigs.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the agricultural system still dominates the practice of extensive cattle raising and\nlivestock. The livestock sector contributes 17% to the national GDP and 32% to the GDP of the\nagricultural sector. According to the livestock census carried out in 2009 by the Directorate-General for\n\n45\n\nLivestock (DGE) under the PRESAR / BAD, the cattle herd is estimated at 1,325,412, distributed mainly\nin the eastern and northern regions.\nTable 1-0-9Subject: Domestic livestock population by species and region, including the Bissau\nAutonomous Sector\n\nSpecies\nRegion\nGrand total\nGrave\nQuina\nOio\nBiomb\nBolam\nBafatá\npeople\nGabú\nCcheus\nBissau\nCattle\n11010\n19778\n223943\n25042\n9065\n294070\n654543\n87240\n721\n1,325,413\nSheep\n4555\n472\n61510\n341\n225\n77348\n153349\n6304\n641\n304,745\nGoats\n34645\n23626\n173731\n26305\n15654\n98052\n193445\n80726\n2900\n649,083\nHorses\n110\n91\n950\n0\n...\n658\n2503\n44\n0\n4,355\nDonkeys\nPigs\n164\n6825\n0\n18075\n4450\n196029\n0\n21462\n...\n31930\n8875\n15295\n20890\n1484\n0\n13089\n0\n13591\n34,770\n343,680\nBirds\n63034\n131180\n422289\n69244\n57948\n211099\n318209\n166510\n43129\n1,482,641\n\nThe Eastern region concentrates the highest concentration of cattle, where the regions of Gabu and Les\nBafatá arise with 71% of cattle herds (49% and 22%); 75% of sheep (50% and 25%); 45% goats (30%\nand 15%); equidae 72.55% (57.45 and 15.10%); donkeys 85.60% (60.08% and 25.52%).\nTo maximise the positive impacts, it is urgent to organise the transhumance chain to promote exploitation\nand high livestock productivity as a contribution to poverty reduction. The total area of pastures is\nestimated at 1,268 million hectares, or about 35% of the country's total area, with approximately 300,000\nhectares in the north, 800,000 hectares in the east and 168 hectares in the south. The biggest limitation\nof the sector is the lack of sufficient technical resources to support shepherds, the lack of infrastructure\nfor water supply and poor animal health control.\n1.13 Forests\nForest capital makes up the bulk of Guinea-Bissau's natural capital, accounting for about 65% of the\ncountry's total natural resources. The total forest cover was estimated at 1.98 million hectares in 2020,\ncorresponding to approximately 55% of the national territory area, consisting mainly of primary forests.\nThe southern part of the country has dense tuff forests, while the northern and central regions are\ncharacterised by wooded savanna and mangrove forests in coastal areas, making Guinea-Bissau one of\nthe densest forest areas in West Africa.\nDespite the high ecological and economic value of forests, there was a tendency for forest cover to\ndecline. Between 2001 and 2021, forest area decreased by approximately 5,075 hectares (World Bank,\n2022). Official annual estimates indicate an average loss of 625,000 m³, distributed as follows:\n\nA 30% reduction in Tombali's dense rainforests;\n\nA 57% reduction in savanna forests in the Bafatá, Oio and Gabú regions;\n\nA 19% reduction in mangrove forests.\nThis decline is mainly explained by anthropogenic pressures, including:\n\nExpansion of agriculture and livestock;\n\nUse of timber for construction and trade;\n\n46\n\n\nProduction of firewood and charcoal for domestic energy.\nThe social and gender impact associated with forest use is significant: household chores related to\nobtaining firewood for cooking fall predominantly on women, reinforcing gender inequalities and work\noverload.\nThe protection, sustainable management and monitoring of forests are therefore national priorities, both\nfor biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation, considering the role of forests as carbon\nsinks.\nTable 1-0-10Subject: Key indicators for the forestry sector\nIndicator\n\nValue/Estimate\n\nRemarks/Source\n\nTotal forest cover\n1.98 million hectares\n55% of the country area (2020)\nProportion of natural capital represented by forests\n65%\nNational assessment\nAverage annual loss of forest area\n625,000 m³/year\nWorld Bank, 2022\nVariation in dense humid forest cover (Tombali)\n-30%\n2001–2021\nVariation in the cover of savanna forests (Bafatá,\nOio, Gabú)\n-57%\n2001–2021\nVariation in mangrove forest cover\n-19%\n2001–2021\nTotal forest cover loss (2001–2021)\n5,075 hectares\nWorld Bank, 2022\nMain causes of forest loss\nAgriculture,\nconstruction,\nfirewood/coal\nAnthropogenic pressures\nGender impact\nHigh\nWomen responsible for collecting\nfirewood and related household\nchores\nPredominant forest types\nPrimary forests,\ncluster forests,\nsavanna forests,\nmangroves\nGeographical distribution north,\ncentre and south\n\n1.14 Public Health\nThe public health sector in Guinea-Bissau remains fragile, strongly affected by socio-political instability,\npoor sanitation and the limited capacity of the health system to deal with health crises. These conditions\ncontribute to the spread of various infectious diseases, including malaria, respiratory diseases, diarrhoea\nand cholera.\n\nPrevalent diseases:\n- Malaria is the leading cause of hospital mortality, being caused mainly by Plasmodium falciparum in\nmore than 90% of cases. It represents about 50% of national hospitalisations, with a higher incidence\namong children, which constitute approximately 65% of paediatric cases.\n- Other important diseases include tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, measles, malnutrition,\nneonatal tetanus, leprosy, hookworm disease and onchocerciasis.\n\n47\n\nHealth system infrastructure and capacity:\n- The country faces severe limitations in testing capacity, underfunded hospitals and a shortage of\nqualified personnel, making the system vulnerable to outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- Dependence on a highly informal economy aggravates the vulnerability of the population, as\ndemonstrated by the delay in the annual harvesting of cashew nuts due to lockdowns, affecting 80% of\nthe economically active population.\nWater, sanitation and hygiene (WASH):\n- Only 10% of the population has access to piped water, 28% use protected wells and 18% use pumps or\nmakeshift sources.\n- About 13% of the population walks 30 minutes or more to reach drinking water, and 6% have access\nto inadequate sources.\n- Poor water and sanitation quality is responsible for a large number of infectious diseases (diarrhoea,\ndysentery, enteric fever).\n- The rate of access to improved water sources is 65%, 84% in urban areas and 53% in rural areas\n(MICS4, 2011).\nNutrition:\n- Chronic malnutrition affects more than 25% of children in the country (MICS5, 2014) due to food\ninsecurity, inadequate health services, poor water and sanitation, inadequate child feeding practices and\nhigh illiteracy rates among women.\nInfluence of climate change:\n- The variability of the rains and the increase in the temperature affect the distribution of disease vectors,\nsuch as the mosquitoes that transmit malaria, dengue and schistosomiasis, increasing the incidence of\ndiseases during the rainy season.\n- Heavy rains favour the proliferation of mosquitoes and contaminate water sources, resulting in a higher\nfrequency of diarrhoea and other infectious diseases.\nInstitutional responses and national programmes:\n- The National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NAP) aims to improve public health, including:\na) Health education;\nb) Ensure minimum sanitation conditions;\nc) Increase in the number of latrines and sanitation centres;\nd) Improve the quality of drinking water, especially in the capital.\n\n48\n\nStrengthening public health is therefore a national priority, integrating measures to adapt to climate\nchange, promoting gender equity and reducing the vulnerability of the most exposed communities.\nTable 1-0-11Subject: Key indicators of the public health sector\n\nIndicator\n\nValue/Estimate\n\nRemarks/Source\nMalaria hospitalisations\n~50% of total\nMINSAP, 1998\nPaediatric malaria cases\n~65% of paediatric admissions\nMINSAP, 1998\nMajor Public Health Illnesses\nMalaria, diarrheal diseases,\nrespiratory diseases, tuberculosis,\nsexually transmitted diseases,\nmeasles, malnutrition, tetanus\nneonatal, leprosy, hookworm,\nonchocerciasis\nNational assessment\nAccess to piped drinking water\n10%\nMICS4, 2011\nAccess to water from protected wells\n28%\nMICS4, 2011\nAccess to water by pump or\nimprovised fountain\n18%\nMICS4, 2011\nAccess to a suitable water source\n(improved)\n65% (urban 84%, rural 53%)\nMICS4, 2011\nTravel time to the source of drinking\nwater\n13% walk ≥30 minutes\nMICS4, 2011\nAccess to adequate sanitation\n<20%\nNational estimate\nPrevalence of chronic malnutrition in\nchildhood\n>25%\nMICS5, 2014\nSocio-economic impact of outbreaks\n(COVID-19, malaria, etc.)\nHigh, affecting yield and\nproductivity\nNational assessment\n1.15 Development Priorities\nGuinea-Bissau's development priorities are directly linked to the need to promote inclusive and\nsustainable economic growth, capable of responding to the country's social, environmental and\ninstitutional challenges. The Government has been aligning its national policies with the United Nations\n2030 Agenda and the African Union 2063 Agenda, ensuring greater coherence between national\nobjectives and international commitments.\nPriority areas include:\na) Reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion, with a focus on creating decent employment\nopportunities, strengthening social protection and combating gender and regional inequalities.\nb) Consolidation of good governance, peace and institutional stability, through the strengthening of\ndemocratic institutions, the rule of law and citizen participation.\nc) Promotion of human capital, with strategic investments in education, health, technical and\nprofessional training and youth empowerment.\nd) Diversification and modernisation of the economy, with special attention to agriculture, fisheries,\ntourism and emerging sectors, promoting food security and sustainable income generation.\ne) Sustainable management of natural resources and environmental protection, giving priority to\nclimate resilience, biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of coastal and forest areas.\n\n49\n\nf) Infrastructure and renewable energy, through expanding access to basic services, rural\nelectrification with clean energy and the development of transport and communication\ninfrastructure.\ng) Regional integration and international cooperation, strengthening Guinea-Bissau's participation\nin the mechanisms of ECOWAS, the African Union and the CPLP, as well as in global\ndevelopment partnerships.\nThese priorities reflect the country's strategic vision of achieving resilient, environmentally sustainable\nand socially inclusive economic development, in line with the National Development Plan and\ninternational commitments.\n1.16 Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Priorities\n\nNational and Regional Context\n\nGuinea-Bissau is located in the coastal zone of West Africa, presenting a high vulnerability to climate\nchange due to its geographical exposure, strong dependence on natural resources and structural\nlimitations\nin\nterms\nof\ninstitutional,\ntechnical\nand\nfinancial\ncapacity.\nWith about 80% of the population dependent on agriculture, fishing and forestry for their livelihoods,\nthe country faces increasing challenges associated with coastal erosion, soil salinisation, irregular rainfall\nvariations, prolonged droughts and recurrent floods.\n\nIn the regional context, Guinea-Bissau integrates several sub-regional climate response initiatives,\nincluding:\n\n- African Island States Climate Commission (AISCC);\n- West Africa Coastal Areas (WACA) initiative;\n- and ECOWAS programmes on renewable energy and integrated coastal management.\nThese platforms strengthen technical and political cooperation among West African countries, enabling\nthe sharing of good practices and joint access to climate finance.\n\nDevelopmental Circumstances\n\nThe national approach to climate change is anchored in the priorities defined in the Strategic and\nOperational Plan \"Terra Ranka II\" (2025–2030), which guides the country’s sustainable development\naround three complementary axes:\n\n1. Green and inclusive economic growth;\n2. Sustainable management of natural resources and biodiversity;\n3. Strengthening environmental and climate governance.\n\nGuinea-Bissau recognises that economic growth and climate resilience are mutually dependent\nobjectives, which is why mitigation and adaptation policies are designed in an integrated manner, based\non national strategic instruments, including:\n\n50\n\n- Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC, 2021);\n- National Adaptation Plan (PAN, 2022);\n- National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (ENBPA);\n- and the National Renewable Energy Plan (PNER, 2023).\n\nAdaptation Priorities\n\nAdaptation is recognised as an absolute priority for sustainable development and the protection of\nvulnerable communities. Key strategic goals and actions include:\n\n1. Strengthening the resilience of coastal and rural communities\n\no Implement coastal protection infrastructure and nature-based measures to curb salt erosion and\nintrusion;\no Promote ecological restoration of mangroves and wetlands.\n\n2. Promoting climate-smart agriculture\n\no Introduction of drought and salinity resistant varieties;\no Adoption of agroecology and integrated soil management practices;\no Creation of local seed banks and rehabilitation of degraded agricultural perimeters.\n\n3. Protection and sustainable management of forest ecosystems, mangroves and river basins\n\no Strengthening the role of IBAP and local communities in conservation;\no Implementation of reforestation programmes and payment for environmental services (PES).\n\n4. Development of early warning systems and climate observation networks\n\no Expansion of the national hydro-meteorological network and technical training of the DirectorateGeneral for Water Resources (DGRH);\no Creation of community communication mechanisms for early warnings on floods and high tides.\n\n5. Strengthening institutional and Community capacity\n\no Integration of adaptation into regional and sectoral development plans;\no Ongoing training of national technicians and local leaders in participatory climate planning.\n\nMitigation Priorities\n\nAlthough Guinea-Bissau contributes marginally to global greenhouse gas emissions, the country\nrecognises the potential of mitigation to promote environmental and socioeconomic co-benefits. The\npriorities are:\n\n51\n\n1. Promotion of renewable energies\no Expansion of solar mini-grids in isolated rural communities;\no Progressive replacement of diesel generators by clean sources.\n\n2. Improving energy efficiency\n\no Implementation of efficiency programmes in public buildings and urban lighting;\no Promoting cleaner transport and improving urban logistics.\n\n3. Valorisation and conservation of forest and mangrove ecosystems\n\no Strengthening the carbon sink role of national forests;\no Monitoring and combating deforestation and illegal logging.\n\n4. Sustainable use of biomass and clean technologies\n\no Introduction of improved stoves and biogas in rural areas;\no Incentives to replace firewood and coal with sustainable alternatives.\n\n5. Integration of low carbon technologies in the productive sectors\n\no Promotion of low-impact fishing and farming practices;\no Modernisation of small industries and agri-food processing.\n\nIntegrated Approach and Strategic Alignment\n\nThe priorities presented are fully aligned with the revised 2021 NDC, the National Adaptation Plan\n(NAP) and the 2030 Sustainable Development Strategy, ensuring a synergistic approach between\nmitigation and adaptation.\n\nIts implementation is based on a combination of:\n\no International climate finance (GEF, GCF, UNDP, World Bank);\no National institutional strengthening (via CNMC, INA and IBAP);\no and regional partnerships with West African and CPLP countries, in particular within the\nframework of the AISCC.\n\n🔗 Nationally Determined Contribution – NDC 2021, Guinea-Bissau\n🔗 National Adaptation Plan – NAP Central\n🔗 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan – CBD\n🔗 Strategic and Operational Plan \"Terra Ranka II\" (2025–2030)\n1.17 Other conditions\n\n52\n\nIn addition to the socio-economic, institutional and climate factors already mentioned, there are other\nconditions that significantly influence sustainable development and the implementation of environmental\nand climate policies in Guinea-Bissau.\nThese conditions include:\n1. Geographical and environmental conditions: The country has a vast coastline, islands and\narchipelagos, extensive mangrove areas and forest resources, whose conservation is essential for\nboth global biodiversity and the livelihood of local communities. However, these areas are highly\nvulnerable to rising sea levels, soil salinisation and ecosystem degradation.\n2. Socio-economic factors: High poverty, dependence on subsistence farming and fragile basic\ninfrastructure pose additional challenges to climate resilience and reducing vulnerabilities.\n3. Political and institutional conditions: Despite progress, challenges related to political instability,\nlimited qualified human resources and weak inter-institutional coordination persist, affecting the\neffectiveness of the implementation of national strategies.\n4. International support: The capacity to mobilise climate finance, technology transfers and\ncapacity building programmes remains essential to enable the country to meet its commitments\nunder the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.\n5. Knowledge and awareness-raising: Limiting access to environmental information and education\nat Community level influences the adoption of good adaptation and mitigation practices, requiring\ngreater investment in awareness-raising and training programmes.\nThese conditions should be considered as transversal factors that shape the definition of priorities and\nstrategies, conditioning both the results achieved and the future needs of the country in the context of\nclimate change and sustainable development.\n1.18 Data or information gaps\nThe availability, quality and timeliness of data are one of Guinea-Bissau's greatest challenges in public\npolicy development, development planning and communication of international obligations under the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nThe main weaknesses identified include:\n1. Climatic and hydrometeorological data: Insufficient observation network, with short time series,\ngaps in the measurement of precipitation, temperature, evaporation, flow and oceanographic\nparameters, hindering robust analysis of climate trends.\n2. Greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory: limited and dispersed data on key sectors (energy, waste,\nagriculture, land use, land use change and forests), which limits the accuracy of national emission\nand removal estimates.\n3. Natural resources and ecosystems: lack of up-to-date information on forest cover, deforestation\nrates, mangrove degradation, marine and coastal biodiversity, making it difficult to monitor and\nplan conservation measures.\n\n53\n\n4. Socio-economic sectors: incomplete statistics on agriculture, fisheries, energy, transport and\nwaste, limiting the integration of climate variables into sectoral development plans.\n5. Socio-economic and vulnerability data: lack of detailed studies on climate vulnerability at EU\nlevel, including gender, youth and most exposed groups, needed to guide inclusive adaptation\npolicies.\n6. Technical and institutional capacities: the absence of consolidated data collection, processing\nand management systems, as well as inter-institutional sharing mechanisms, leads to duplications,\ninconsistencies and loss of relevant information.\nThese weaknesses hamper the ability to plan, monitor and evaluate mitigation and adaptation actions\neffectively and limit the preparation of technical reports such as National Communications, Biennial\nTransparency Reports (BTRs) and National Adaptation Plans.\nStrengthening national capacities for data collection, management and sharing is therefore a priority\nneed, including the modernisation of observation networks, the development of integrated information\nsystems and technical training of human resources.\n1.19 Suggestions and improvements needed\nBased on the analysis of national circumstances and institutional arrangements, a number of areas are\nidentified where reinforcement measures and improvements are needed to strengthen governance, socioeconomic resilience and climate change response capacity:\nInstitutional strengthening and intersectoral coordination:\n- Strengthen government bodies responsible planning, monitoring and implementing climate,\nenvironmental and urban development policies;\n- Improve integration between ministries and institutions by promoting shared information systems and\nconsistent data flows.\nTechnical training and human resources:\n- Develop continuous training programmes for technicians and managers in critical areas such as GHG\ninventory, urban planning, water resources management, public health and forest management;\n- Encourage training in clean and sustainable technologies, adapted to national realities.\nData Systems and Monitoring:\n- Modernise and expand climate, hydrological and environmental observation networks;\n- Establish centralised and accessible databases, ensuring quality, up-to-date and reliable information for\ninternational decision-making and reporting.\nCritical Infrastructure and Basic Services:\n- Improve the transport network, ports and aerodromes;\n- Increasing access to clean water, sanitation and clean energy, especially in peri-urban and rural areas;\n\n54\n\n- Strengthen the housing stock by promoting social housing and sustainable construction.\nEnvironmental sustainability and climate mitigation:\n- Promote sustainable forest management practices, mangrove protection and biodiversity conservation;\n- Encourage the transition to renewable energy sources and low-carbon technologies in the industrial,\ntransport and residential sectors;\n- Integrate gender considerations and social inclusion into mitigation and adaptation policies.\nResilience and public health:\n- Strengthen the public health system and the capacity to respond to outbreaks and epidemics;\n- Implement health education programmes, disease prevention and access to adequate sanitation;\n- Adapting health policies to climate change, considering seasonal and geographical vulnerabilities.\nIn summary, the implementation of these suggestions aims to increase national resilience, improve\ngovernance, reduce vulnerabilities and prepare the country to face the challenges arising from climate\nchange, ensuring sustainable and inclusive development.\n\n55\n\nCHAPTER II: NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY\n\n2.1 Introduction\nThis chapter presents a summary of the inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions carried out in\nGuinea-Bissau for the period between 2010 and 2022. The inventory was carried out for anthropogenic\nGHG emissions from four sectors: Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture,\nForestry and Land Use (AFOLU) and Waste. GHG emissions have been estimated in accordance with\nthe UNFCCC Guidelines for National Reports (NCS) of Parties not included in Annexe I to the\nConvention and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The GHG report\nwas also produced following the Paris Agreement’s Methodologies, Procedures, and Guidelines as a\nrecent guidance for countries to prepare National Inventory Reports for Biennial Upgrade Reports.\nDue to capacity limitations of national experts, data availability and methodological issues, only\nestimates of direct greenhouse gases, i.e. CO₂, CH₂ and N₂O, were considered in this inventory. It is\ninteresting to note that, although the disclosure of precursors and indirect emissions is not mandatory for\nnon-Annexe I countries, these gases need to be considered in future Biennial Update reports, as they are\nlinked to the national management of air pollution, which is a priority for Guinea-Bissau.\n2.2 Brief description of the institutional arrangement\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the national GHG inventory system is based on several categories of stakeholders:\n* The national entity responsible for coordinating actions related to climate change and GHG inventories\nis the Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC) / National Environment\nInstitute (INA).\n\n* The National Focal Point for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC) is MABAC, an entity designated by the Government to coordinate and report on the country's\ncommitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. This focal point is responsible for climate\nreports – including National Communications; Biennial Reports (BUR and BTR) and NDC, which\npresent GHG inventories and mitigation and adaptation measures.\n\n* MABAC is responsible for: i) leading the data collection, analysis and reporting process; ensuring that\nthe inventory is in line with the IPCC and UNFCCC guidelines; mobilising financial and technical\nresources for the inventory development.\nIn addition to the coordinating body, there are entities and technical institutions that play key roles in the\ninventory process:\n* The National Technical Coordinator: its mission is to organise the national coordination of the\ninventory, validate the priorities according to the available resources, approve the methods implemented\nby the Unit, inventory and validate the report before transmission to the UNFCCC.This function is not\nnecessarily technical, but involves the general and transversal management and approval of the various\nresults.\n\n56\n\n* The inventory team, consisting of a Technical Coordinator and Sector Inventory Consultants, has the\nmission to define the methods to be applied, organise data collection, perform emissions calculations at\nsector level in collaboration with focal points, compile the inventory and write reports. This function is\nhighly technical and requires significant stakeholder involvement.\n\n* Data Providers and Consultants are responsible for transmitting the information at their disposal to the\ninventory team in case of direct request.\n\n* Other experts from industry, civil society, researchers, etc.: monitor and occasionally participate in\nindustry working groups at the request of the inventory team.\nThe national GHG inventory is a process of continuous improvement, in which the data collection phase\nis an essential link for its success. The preparation of the national GHG inventory is an inclusive and\nparticipatory process, which establishes the division of specific responsibilities between the institutions\nparticipating in the inventory, in order to ensure that the collection of sufficient data on activities, the\nselection and development of methods, emission factors and other parameters are in line with the IPCC\nguidelines and GMPs.\n2.2.1. Information archiving\nThe inventory archiving process consists of the following: After the publication of the original inventory\nreport, the methodological chips (MPs) used to compile the national inventory are archived to track the\nversions used in the production of the inventory, the purpose of which is to ensure inventory traceability.\nThe National GHG Inventory Coordinator shall be responsible for all reported time series information,\nincluding all disaggregated emission factors and activity data, all documentation on data generation and\naggregation, review results and planned inventory improvements. Each National Sectorial Consultant\nwill execute its own archive.\nThe archive is carried out in electronic means and facilities that guarantee the integrity of the\nInformation (especially losses over time, accidental risks, etc.) and, therefore, is stored safely\n(internal and remote backups, paper, read only and dates).\nAfter the publication of the inventory master report, the methodological chips (MCs) that were used\nto compile the national inventory will be archived to track the versions that were used to produce\nthe inventory of an edition, the purpose of which is to ensure the traceability of the inventory.\nThe coordinator is responsible for the inventory file. Each National Sector Adviser will run its own\nfile.\nTo facilitate this work, you will all need industry experts to work on a common file architecture.\nBelow is a working tree and a proposal:\n\n57\n\nNumber16: GHG inventory storage system\nA source directory is created and the name of that directory matches the name of the methodological\nrecord.\nThis directory also contains a subdirectory \"references\", which allows you to store the references\nused to create the worksheets. All other items of interest relating to this edition of the inventory\nshould also be kept there. The results files are also stored.\nAll responsible inventory edits will be retained.\nThe archive must be made on media and installations that guarantee the integrity of the information\n(especially losses over time, accidental risks, etc.) and, therefore, must be stored safely (internal and\nremote backups, IT and paper, read only and dates).\n2.2.2. Procedures for official examination and inventory approval\nAfter the collection, processing and analysis of GHG emissions data, the national coordination of the\ninventory shall draw up a draft chapter on the inventory. This document is submitted to Quality Control\n(QC) by the team of specialists and Quality Assurance (QA) by the National Technical Coordination in\na workshop. This document shall be submitted for evaluation by the heads of the working groups of\nnational experts and the National Technical Coordinator.\nThe process of evaluating and officially approving a GHG inventory involves several important steps to\nensure accuracy, transparency and compliance with international standards.\nThe steps are:\ni) Preparation of the inventory.\nii) Internal verification and validation.\niii) Public consultations.\n\n58\n\niv) Submission to review/validation bodies, such as: the United Nations Environment\nProgramme (UNEP) and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC);\nv) Official approval.\nvi) International publication and submission.\n2.3. Overview of the methodology\nThe Guinea-Bissau GHG inventory report has been developed and structured in accordance with the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2006 IPCC guidelines.\nGHG emissions and their uncertainties were estimated for a period between 2010 and 2022 for the energy,\nAFOLU and Waste sectors, and their respective categories. The IPPU sector was not considered due to\nvery high data uncertainty. In general, the Level 1 methodology was applied to estimate direct greenhouse\ngas emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) for all sectors, and country-specific data were considered when\navailable.\nThe activity data used for the Guinea-Bissau GHG inventory between 2010 and 2022 were obtained\nmainly from various stakeholders, as summarised in table 2.1 below.\nTable 2-0-1:Institutions contributing to the GHG inventory\n\nInstitutions\n\nResponsibilities/data collected\n\nMinistry of Energy (ME)\nMEI is responsible for defining the policies, legislation and regulation of the\nenergy sector. It also promotes renewable energy and regulates the oil sector.\nThe ministry is responsible for issuing import and export licences for energy\nproducts and setting electricity tariffs.\nDirectorate-General for Energy\n(DGE):\nEGO implements energy policies, promotes renewable energy and renewable\nenergy (RE) and renewable energy (EE) projects, and oversees electricity\ngeneration and distribution. It is also responsible for approving tariffs and\ncustoms exemptions for renewable energy projects.\nSupport Institutions:\nElectricity and Water of Guinea-Bissau (EAGB) has the technical\nresponsibility to implement electricity related programmes\nNational Institute of Applied\nResearch and Technology (INITA):\nUnder the tutelage of the Ministry of Natural Resources, INITA develops\nstudies on biomass and other renewable energy sources.\n\nMinistry of Environment,\nBiodiversity and Climate Action:\nResponsible for environmental management and environmental impact\nassessment of energy projects.\nMinistry of Agriculture\nInvolved in the management of forest resources and in the implementation of\nprojects that integrate energy and agriculture.\nMinistry of Economy and Finance\nIt maintains a priority relationship with all development projects. It also acts\nas an intermediary in relations with donors and donors.\n\nThe year 2015 was chosen as the reference year according to Decisions 1/CP. 16 and 2.º/CP. 17 and\nconsidering the availability of data according to national circumstances.\nEmissions are calculated simply by multiplying the activity data (AD) of the categories and subcategories\nand the emission factors (EFs) established in accordance with the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and the IPCC\n\n59\n\nrecommendations on good practices and uncertainty management for national GHG inventories of 2003\n(\"GHG for LULUCF\").\nEmission = AD x EF\nWhere:\nAD: human activity resulting in GHG emissions or removals, occurring over a given period and in a\nspecific area\nEF: Emission factor, i.e. coefficient quantifying emissions or absorptions of a gas per unit of activity\ndata.\nUsing the IPCC 2006 Inventory Software, emissions are calculated by considering the integrity and level\nof uncertainty in the collected activity data and the emission factors for each category and subcategory.\n2.4 Summary of aggregate emissions/removals and trends\n2.4.1. Analysis of total emissions\nCalculations were based on the following formulae:\na) Total Growth Rate (%) = (Ending Value – Ending Value)/Ending Value)*100\nb) Annual Growth Rate (%) = (Final Value/Initial Value)(1/n)-1; where n = number of years\nc) Growth Projection:\nEnding Value = Baseline x (1+ r)n; where r = Annual Growth Rate; n = number of years in the projection\nperiod\nThe total national emissions of Guinea-Bissau in 2010, in Gg of CO2eq, without LULUCF, were 2,075.3\nGgCO2eq; 2,425.7 GgCO2eq in 2015 and 2848.5 GgCO2eq in 2022. The progressive emission rate from\n2010 to 2022 is 37.3%. If this trend continues, by 2030 total national emissions will be 3 506.5 GgCO2eq\nand reach 5 789.3 GgCO2eq in 2050.\nThe total national emissions of GgCO2eq in Guinea-Bissau with LULUCF in 2010 are -25,142.5\nGgCO2eq; in 2015, they are -19,309.6 GgCO2eq and, in 2022, they are -19,696.2 GgCO2eq. If this trend\ncontinues, by 2030 the country will emit −16779.8 GgCO2eq and reach −11398.7 GgCO2eq by 2050. As\nsuch, Guinea-Bissau will remain a carbon sink until 2050.\nFor total gas emissions:\nIn 2010, CO2 emissions were -27090 GgCO2-Eq, including LULUCF; CH4 emissions were 1884.2\nGgCO2eq; N2O emissions were 63 GgCO2eq; and HFCs were 17.28 GgCO2eq.\n\nIn 2015, CO2 emissions were -21554 GgCO2-Eq, including LULUCF; CH4 emissions were 2164.7\nGgCO2eq; N2O emissions were 73 GgCO2eq; and HFCs were 14.26 GgCO2eq.\n\nIn 2022, CO2 emissions are -22,211 GgCO2-Eq, including LULUCF; CH4 emissions are 2,448.8\nGgCO2eq; N2O is 66 GgCO2eq; and HFCs are 600.7 GgCO2eq.\nHere is the organised table with the total emissions data by gas and by year:\n\n60\n\nTable: Summary of Total Gas Emissions by Gas\nYear\nCO2 (GgCO2eq,\nincl.

The equivalent emission of CO2 will be obtained by\n\n61\n\nmultiplying the emission of a GHG by its global warming potential (GWP) from the IPCC's fifth\nassessment report for the time horizon considered.\"\nBetween 2010 and 2022, national GHG emissions show an increasing trend. In fact, emissions increased\nfrom 2,075.3 GgCO2eq in 2010 to 2,848.5 GgCO2eq in 2022, an increase of 37.26% without LULUCF.\nIf this trend continues, by 2030 national GHG emissions will be 3,518.09 GgCO2eq and, by 2050, will\nreach 5,963.92 GgCO2eq.\nIn the Energy sector, emissions increased from 233.0 Gg in 2010 to 309.2 Gg in 2015, representing a\ngrowth of 32.6%. Between 2015 and 2022, emissions continued to rise from 309.2 Gg to 458.2 Gg, which\ncorresponds to an increase of 48.2%. In the total period from 2010 to 2022, emissions nearly doubled,\nwith cumulative growth of 96.6 per cent.\nIn the LULUCF sector, CO2eq removals decreased from –27,217.8 Gg in 2010 to –22,544.7 GgCO2eq\nin 2022, corresponding to a 17.18% loss in emission removal capacity.\nIn the waste sector, emissions increased from 124.8 GgCO2eq in 2010 to 229.5 GgCO₂eq in 2015,\nreaching 288.1 GgCO2eq in 2022. In the 2010-2022 period, the sector’s emissions more than doubled,\nrepresenting an increase of approximately 130%.\nNational CO2eq emissions have a general trend of increasing between 2010 and 2022 and increase by\n8% per year.\n\nFigure 17: Total GHG emissions (in%); Distribution by sector; 2010 - 2015 - 2022\n\n62\n\n2.5 Analysis of the main categories\n2.5.1. Results of the analysis without LULUCF\nThe analysis of the main categories without LULUCF in 2022 revealed ten (10) main categories covering\n95% of total GHG emissions.\n1. Enteric fermentation (CTR 3. A): Enteric fermentation is the main source of CH4 emissions, with\n51.95% of total emissions (2848.5GgCO2eq), or 1479.8 GgCO2eq. This demonstrates the\nimportance of agriculture, and more specifically livestock, in the country’s GHG balance.\n2. Solid waste tank (CTR 5. A): This is the second main category, with CH4 emissions accounting\nfor 14.29% of total emissions, i.e. 407 GgCO2eq.\n3. Road transport (CTR 1.A.3.b): CO2 emissions from liquid fuels contribute 7.37% of total\ncumulative emissions, or 209.93 GgCO2eq.\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\nGgCO2e\nAnos\nSem LULUCF\n201\n0\n201\n1\n201\n2\n201\n3\n201\n4\n201\n5\n201\n6\n201\n7\n201\n8\n201\n9\n202\n0\n202\n1\n202\n2\nCom LULUCF -251 -273 -255 -143 -190 -193 -161 -147 -153 -149 -138 -173 -196\n-35000\n-30000\n-25000\n-20000\n-15000\n-10000\n-5000\n0\nGgCO2e\nAnos\nCom LULUCF\n\n63\n\n4. Rice cultivation (RTC 3. C): CH4 emissions from rice cultivation represent 5.24% of total\nemissions, or 110.8 GgCO2eq.\n5. Industrial energy (CTR 1.A.1): Liquid fuel (heavy oil, petrol and diesel) from industrial energy\naccounts for 3.95% of total CO2 emissions, or 99 GgCO2eq.\n6. Other sectors - Solid biomass (CTR 1.A.4): CH4 emissions from solid biomass account for 3.89%\nof total emissions, or 110.8 GgCO2eq.\n7. Manure management (CTR 3.B): CH4 emissions from manure management represent 2.24 % of\ntotal emissions, or 63.8 GgCO2eq.\n8. Discharge and treatment of waste water (CTR 5. D): CH4 emissions from waste water discharge\nand treatment account for 2.12% of total emissions, or 60.4 GgCO2eq.\n9. Incineration and open burning of waste (CTR 5. C): CH4 emissions from the incineration and\nburning of waste in the open air account for 1.78% of total emissions, or 50.7 GgCO2eq.\n2.5.2. Results of the LULUCF analysis\nBy including emissions and removals from the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forests (LULUCF)\nsector, the national GHG emissions profile in 2022 shows significant differences.\n\nThe LULUCF sector plays a crucial role as a net carbon sink, absorbing a significant share of\nemissions from other sectors.\n\nNet CO₂ removals associated with forests and other land uses partially offset emissions, reducing\nthe national total GHG.\n\nThus, while agriculture, waste, and energy remain the major emitting sectors, the country’s\noverall GHG balance is strongly influenced by land-use dynamics, in particular forest\nconservation and biomass burning practices.\nAccording to the analysis:\n1. Enteric fermentation (CTR 3. A) remains the main source of emissions, but its relative\ncontribution to the national total decreases when considering the effect of LULUCF removals.\n2. Solid waste tank (CTR 5. A) and road transport (CTR 1.A.3.b) remain among the most relevant\ncategories, but also with lower percentages in total.\n3. The LULUCF sector presents a net balance of CO2 absorption, highlighting the strategic role of\nGuinea-Bissau forest cover in climate change mitigation.\nIn quantitative terms, the inclusion of LULUCF results in:\n\nSignificant reduction in total net emissions, with the absorption of CO2 by forests offsetting a\nsignificant fraction of gross emissions.\n\nChange in the percentage shares of the main emitting categories as LULUCF removals reduce\nthe relative weight of each sector.\n2.5.3. Results of trend analysis with LULUCF\nIn terms of Level I trend analysis, three (3) categories cover 96.2% of total emissions.\n\n64\n\nTable 2-0-3:Trend of the main categories from 2010 to 2022\nIPCC\ncategory\ncode\nIPCC Category\nGreenhouse gas\n2010\nestimate\nEx0Gg\n(CO2 Eq)\n2022\nestimate\nExtGg\n(CO2 Eq)\nTrend\nAssessme\nnt\n(TXT)\n%\nContributio\nn to trend\nCumulativ\ne total for\ncolumn G\n3.B.1.a\nForest remnant land\nCARBON\nDIOXIDE (CO2)\n-30818.7\n-29644.1\n0.153132\n0.618289\n0.618289\n3.B.2.b\nLand converted into\ncropland\nCARBON\nDIOXIDE (CO2)\n3600.87\n7099.42\n0.075376\n0.304341\n0.92263\n4A\nDisposal of Solid\nWaste\nMETHANE (CH4)\n0\n358,1944\n0.009939\n0.04013\n0.96276\n\nCO2 emissions from the category \"Forest land remaining as forest land\" appear first, with a contribution\nto the trend of about 61.82%, followed by CO2 emissions from \"Forest land converted to agricultural\nland\", which represent 30.4% of the contribution to the trend, or 92.22% of the total accumulated. The\ndisposal of solid waste, which contributes to CH4 emissions, accounts for 4% of the contribution.\n2.6 Comparison of GHG emissions from reference and sectoral approaches\n\nComparison of GHG emissions from reference and sectoral approaches has not been conducted due to\nlack of reliable data. This will be conducted in the GHG inventory of upcoming BTR2 report.\n2.7 Trend in emissions by sector\n\n2.7.1. Energy Sector\nThe predominant energy emissions come from the transport and residential categories. From 2019 to\n2022, electricity generation has also become the source of GHG emissions. Other energy categories are\nnot significant from 2010 to 2022. Therefore, we can conclude that energy emissions are dominated by\ntransport, residential and electricity generation.\n\n65\n\nNumber18: Trend in CO2-Eq emissions 2010-2022\nTrend in gas emissions in CO2 equivalent\nBetween 2010 and 2022, Guinea-Bissau's energy sector emitted a total of 4445.2 Gg of CO2eq, with\nmost emissions originating from the Transport sector (1.A.3), followed by the Other Sectors (1.A.4),\nEnergy Industry (1.A.1) and Manufacturing and Construction Industry (1.A.2), with inventoried data\nfrom 2019 to 2022 (see Figure 19). During this period, CO2 emissions increased from 46% to 67% of\nthe total, while CH4 emissions decreased from 48% to 29%, and N2O emissions remained insignificant,\nshowing a slight reduction from 6% to 4%. Carbon dioxide therefore remains the main emitter in the\nenergy sector (see Figure 20).\n\nFigure 19Subject: Distribution of equivalent CO2 emissions by type of gas for the years 2010-2015-022\n2.7.2. Industrial Processes and Product Use (CRT sector 2)\nData and information were collected to estimate the emissions of this sector and a draft report was\nprepared for the IPPU Sector.\n0,0\n100,0\n200,0\n300,0\n400,0\n500,0\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\nGg\nCO2e\nEmissão de GEE por setor\nElectricity Generation\nManuf.

For\nexample, the production of paraffin wax, which is derived from petroleum, is used in various industrial\napplications such as lubricants, packaging, textiles and candles. However, the production and use of these\nproducts in the country are limited and not widely documented.\nUse of Fluorinated Gases in Air Conditioning and Cooling\nThe use of fluorinated gases, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), in air conditioning and refrigeration\nsystems is a common practice in many countries. In Guinea-Bissau, import data indicate stability between\n2010 and 2018, with a slight reduction of 1.05%, from 17.34 Gg to 17.16 Gg. However, in 2019, an\nextremely high variation was recorded, with imports rising from 17.16 Gg to 17,160 Gg, indicating a\nsignificant increase in the use of these gases.\nConclusion\nAlthough the IPPU sector in Guinea-Bissau is considered insignificant due to limited industrialisation,\nsome industrial activities in the country involve the use of products such as lubricants, paraffins and\nsolvents, as well as fluorinated gases in air conditioning and refrigeration systems. It is important to\nmonitor and regulate these activities to mitigate their emissions and environmental impacts.\n2.7.3.

However, in\n2011, there was a drop in productivity due to the significant reduction of mineral fertilisers, consequently\nin farmers' income, which motivated, in the following year, 2012, the abundant reuse of mineral\nfertilisers. Thanks to the promotion of MADR, in the following years farmers were trained, sensitised\nand monitored in the area of the rational use of this product (mineral fertiliser) and the health benefits of\nthe gradual transition to organic farming.\nThe Agricultural sector in the lateral direction (agriculture and livestock) has its GHG emissions that tend\nto grow, according to the estimated results, see table below.\nTable 2-0-5Subject: Total contribution of the agricultural sector to GHG emissions\nYear\nCategories\nTotal Emissions Agriculture\nLivestock sub-sector\nSubsector Agriculture\n2010\n1416.48\n286.42\n1702.9\n2011\n1170.88\n187.87\n1358.75\n2012\n1475.4\n376.28\n1,851.68\n2013\n1570.08\n312.56\n1882.64\n2014\n1248.4\n285.84\n1534.24\n2015\n1,568.59\n304.11\n1,872.69\n2016\n1300.88\n273.34\n1574.22\n2017\n1634.09\n236.12\n1870.21\n2018\n1654.21\n191.49\n1845.7\n2019\n1,702.57\n280.26\n1982.83\n\n68\n\n2020\n1737.74\n276.58\n2014.32\n2021\n1773.77\n244.37\n2018.15\n2022\n1810.61\n273.95\n2084.57\n\nTrends in the Subsector AGRICULTURE\n\nNumber21Subject: Emissions trends in the agricultural sector\nForests and other land uses\nForests and Other Land Uses, at the level of GHG inventory, assume the role of sequestrators of these\ngases in the atmosphere.

Waste\nTimes series of emissions development in the waste sector:\nTotal annual emissions from the waste sector gradually increased in 2010 from 2015 to 2022, with an\nannual rate of increase commensurate with population growth.\nFigure 1 summarises the trend in greenhouse gas emissions by category code in the waste sector (CO2=\n4C, CH4= 4, CH4=4D, CH4=4C, N2O= 4D, N2O= 4C).\n\n71\n\nTable 2-0-9Subject: Total emissions per year\n\n Figure 24Subject: Trends in CO2 emissions from the waste sector\nAlthough waste water was the main contributor to CH4 emissions from the waste sector, the higher rate\nof increase in emissions from solid waste disposal shows that solid waste disposal is also gradually\nbecoming an important contributor to CH4 emissions from the solid waste category (4A).\nOverview of the evolution of gaseous emissions by waste sub-categories:\ni) CH4 from the natural decomposition of solid waste going to landfills/landfills, biological treatment\nof solid waste, waste water treatment and disposal and incineration of solid waste;\nii) CO2 emissions from the incineration and open burning of solid waste;\niii) N2O emissions from waste water treatment and disposal, biological treatment of solid waste and\nwaste incineration.\nBetween 2010, 2015 and 2022, total direct GHG emissions from the waste sector grew steadily. This\nincrease is due to all subsectors due to:\na) Population growth,\nb) The increase in the amount of waste generated in the country,\nc) Installation of autonomous wastewater treatment systems.\nOverall, the contribution of CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions to all sub-categories of the waste sector in\nGuinea-Bissau gradually increased, taking into account the periods 2010, 2015 and 2022, according to\nIPCC Software 2006 calculations.\nCH4 emissions from the waste sector increased by 100.15 GgCO2eq in 2010, 202.34 Gg CO2eq in 2015\nand 256.65 GgCO2eq in 2022, according to the table below.\nTable 2-0-10:GgCO2eq time series summary\nYEAR\nCH4\nN2O\nCO2\nTOTAL\nYear\nTotal (Gg CO2 Eq)\n2010\n124.84\n2011\n158.86\n2012\n183.98\n2013\n202.98\n2014\n217.77\n2015\n229.58\n2016\n239.71\n2017\n248.59\n2018\n256.65\n2019\n264.18\n2020\n273.92\n2021\n281.01\n2022\n288.12\n0,00\n50,00\n100,00\n150,00\n200,00\n250,00\n300,00\n350,00\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022\nTendência das emissões\n\n72\n\n2010\n100.15\n18.80\n5.89\n124.84\n2015\n202.34\n20.84\n6.40\n229.58\n2022\n256.65\n24.07\n7.41\n288.12\nSource: IPCC 2006 (Software)\n\nFigure 25: GHG emissions (CH4, N2O and CO2); 2010, 2015 and 2022; in GgCO2-Eq\n\n2.7.5. Summary of the sectoral contribution to national emissions (No LULUCF)\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the GHG emitting sectors, in order of importance, are agriculture, energy, waste and\nindustrial processes.\nIn 2010, the main GHG emitting sectors were agriculture (82%), energy (11%), waste (5.95%) and\nindustrial processes (1.4%).\n\nIn 2015, the main GHG emitting sectors were agriculture with (77.3%), waste with (9.4%), energy\n(12.6%) and industrial processes with (0.6%).\n\nIn 2022, the main GHG emitting sectors were the agricultural sector (76%), the waste sector (10%) and\nthe energy sector (14%) of total emissions, as can be seen in Figure 1.\n2.8 Quality Assurance and Control Procedures (QA/QC)\nQuality Control (QC) was observed from the collection, compilation and validation of data, to the\nverification of the methodology, among the elements of the inventory working group. The collected data\nwere compiled and compared before being introduced in the software. In the introductory phase, one\nelement informs, the other verifies and the third introduces, avoiding as much as possible the margin of\nerror. After obtaining the results of the question, the team leader analysed the results obtained, observing the\nlogic and consistency of the values in relation to the year.\n0,00\n50,00\n100,00\n150,00\n200,00\n250,00\n300,00\nCH4\nN2O\nCO2\nGráfico de resumo de emissões para os anos 2010, 2015 e 2022\nSérie1\nSérie2\nSérie3\n\n73\n\nAs regards quality assurance (QA), there is no established structure at national level that can verify noncompliance of the inventory group to verify quantitative and qualitative emission procedures and results.\nHowever, the report is shared with UNEP for review and comment before being submitted to the\nUNFCCC.\n2.9 Overall assessment of uncertainty\nThe uncertainty in CO2 estimates for the residential category is 7.92% for liquid fuels. For methane\n(CH4), the uncertainty is 200.06%, while for nitrous oxide (N2O), this uncertainty is 236.42%. As for\nthe estimates of CO2 for solid biomass in the same category, the uncertainties are 19.35% for CO2,\n227.33% for CH4 and 297.77% for N224.\nRegarding the commercial and institutional category, the uncertainty in the CO2 estimates for liquid fuels\nremains at 7.92%. For methane (CH4), the uncertainty is 200.06%, and for nitrous oxide (N2O), the\nuncertainty of the estimates is also 236.42%. For solid biomass in this category, the uncertainties are\n19.35% for CO2, 227.33% for CH4 and 297.77% for N24.\nFor Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses, evaluations were conducted using the Level 1\nmethodology in accordance with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the good practices set out therein and\nalso following Chapter 2, paragraph 29 of the MPGs. The uncertainties of the activity data were estimated\nusing expert judgement according to the level of data collection, i.e. the level of reliability of the data\ncollected in different national and international institutions. The IPCC Excel uncertainty calculation table\nwas used, where the results of GHG emissions and removals, percentage uncertainty of activity data,\nstandard emission factor, start year and most recent inventory (2010 and 2022) were introduced. The\ncombined uncertainty is the calculation of the two uncertainties (activity data and emission factor) plus\nthe GHG emission results equivalent to CO2, see table below.\nTable 2-0-11:Subcategory uncertainty estimation\nPeriod\nCategories\nIndicator\nUncertainty of\nactivity data\nIssuance factor\nuncertainty\nCombined\nuncertainty\n2010 and 2022\nForest land remaining in forest\nland\n± 5%\n± 7%\n± 8.6%\nEnteric fermentation\n± 6%\n± 7%\n± 9.2%\nLand\nconverted\nto\nagricultural land\n± 6%\n± 7%\n± 9.2%\nSource: IPCC Excel uncertainty calculation table\nAccording to this table, the uncertainties of the different categories were calculated together with the\nresults of their GHG emissions, see more details in the attached uncertainty calculation table.\n\nTable 2-0-12: Estimation of quantitative inventory uncertainties at national level\n\nSector\nIndicator\nTotal stock uncertainty (%)\nUncertainty trend (%)\nAFOLU\n12.7\n2.2\n\n74\n\nThe main source of uncertainties are the standard emission factors, for which the country does not yet\nhave its own data, some missing data that have been extrapolated and the reliability of data from different\nnational and international institutions. In this way, the AFOLU Industry Expert Group will do its utmost\nto ensure the highest level of data collection and compilation of information, with the aim of reducing\nthe level of uncertainty of inventory data at national level.\n2.10 Overall assessment of completeness\nWithin this inventory, the scope assessment covers the sectors of activity concerned. The method of\nanalysis is in accordance with the guidelines in paragraphs 30, 31 and 33 of Decision 18/CMA.1.\nStandard notifications are used to notify the emission/absorption categories and sources for which\nemissions have been estimated and those for which emissions have not been estimated, either because of\na lack of data or because the category is not available at national level.\nUndeclared categories and subcategories are recorded in the Tables: Energy; Agriculture; LULUCF and\nWaste. In fact, these are categories for which, on the one hand, activities are non-existent at national level\nand, on the other hand, data and information relating to the inventory period are not available.\nThe general table of completeness for 2022 is presented below and the categories of sectoral emissions\nnot occurring with explanations are presented in the next 2 tables for energy and AFOLU.\n\nInventory year: 2022\n\nEmissions\n(Gg)\nCategories\nNet CO2\n(1)(2)\nCH4\nN2O\nTotal National Emissions and Removals\n-22 210 900\n99,998\n0.251\n1 -

In this inventory, we seek to estimate all direct greenhouse\ngas emissions for all categories of sources in agriculture. Estimated and non-estimated emission\nschedules for the categories considered are detailed in the respective sections. Despite the efforts,\ngreenhouse gas emissions for some categories and subcategories were not included in this inventory,\nmainly due to the lack of reference data.\n2.12 Planned improvements\nPlanned improvement in the energy sector\nWhile we have obtained a consistent time series on GHG emissions from the energy sector, there are data\ngaps related to the reporting system. Areas of improvement related to biomass include the following:\nIn the transport sector, there are still some gaps in the data, especially at the level of aggregation. The\nfollowing improvement can help solve this problem and contribute to a better estimation of GHG\nemissions:\n Conduct research on biomass fuel consumption in households,\n- Collection of data on the age of vehicles\n- Data collection on fuel consumption by categories and characteristics of vehicles and aircraft\n- Collection of data on kilometres travelled by vehicles\n- Breakdown between the fuel consumption of transport vehicles and other sectors using petroleum\nproducts, such as households, industries and commercial institutions/activities.\n\nFurther improvements in the collection of data on various fuels (such as diesel, kerosene, LPG) used in\ndomestic and institutional/commercial activities should also receive special attention, as these activities\nare the main contributors to Rwanda's total GHG emissions.\nPlanned improvement in the IPPU industry\nData collection and quality assurance in:\n- non-energy uses of fuels (lubricants, paraffins, solvents)\n- use of fluorinated gases in air conditioning and refrigeration in Guinea-Bissau.\nImprovements planned by AFOLU Sector\nThe agricultural sector, as one of the important sectors in this context, deserves special attention due to\nits specificities. Research institutions and universities should be encouraged or facilitated to conduct\nresearch on existing gaps to develop local emission factors that allow the calculation of Level 2\ngreenhouse gas emissions.\nIn the meantime, in order to reduce uncertainties and significantly improve estimates of GHG emissions\nin the AFOLU sector, favourable conditions for sustainable improvement should be created, which is\nmainly based on the discussion of the amended software version of the IPCC 2006 as regards category\n3B - Land and category 3C - aggregated sources and sources of non-CO2 emissions on land, notably in\nburned field (see C. 14).\n\n81\n\nLivestock sub-sector\nGiven the difficulties faced by this AFOLU sub-sector in terms of updated data, i.e. the last animal census\nof 2009, without others, the data used were calculated on the basis of the animal growth rate of the MSAR\nstatistical institute. It is therefore appropriate to take the following measures:\n Fund a project for the general national animal census.\n Categorise the animals according to their characteristics and areas.\n Improve and adopt the modern waste management system to allow the estimation of gases (N2O,\nNOx and NMVOC);\n Develop national emission factors to minimise uncertainties in the GHG inventory results of this\nsector;\n Estimate in the future all sub-sector related gases with a time series starting from the year 1990 as\nrecommended by the MPG guidelines.\nAgricultural subsector\n Improve source calculation and collection of reliable activity data, including: fertiliser use, arable\nland, crop residues.\nForestry and land use sub-sector\n Improve data collection to monitor the time series from 1990 to 2025, respecting the MPG\nguidelines;\n Use of the Geographic Information System (GIS) to calculate degraded forest areas and changes\nin land use.\n Forest mapping with high resolution images for updating forest cover data in different ecological\nzones and forest types;\n Calculate the emissions of the categories that, due to lack of data, have not had their emissions\nestimated.\nPlanned improvements in the Waste Sector\nThe creation of an accessible and efficient solid waste management system and the introduction of\nsustainable practices such as selective collection, recycling, composting and biogas-based energy\ngeneration would reduce large amounts of methane emissions in this category.\nEstablish community recycling cooperatives, employ local labour and reduce waste accumulation in\nhazardous areas.\n\n82\n\nCHAPTER III: PROGRAMMES CONTAINING MEASURES TO MITIGATE\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n3.1. Introduction\nThe mitigation assessment presented in this chapter is an updated action plan of Guinea-Bissau’s\nmitigation actions, based on Guinea-Bissau’s NDC, updated in 2021,1 and the monitoring of GuineaBissau’s NDC, according to Guinea-Bissau’s BTR1 2Report. The proposed mitigation options are\nactivities directed to the energy, forestry and land use sectors, selected based on the analysis of key\ncategories of the GHG inventory, taking into account mainly that the selected mitigation options can lead\nto carbon market projects. In fact, energy and forestry projects are easy to implement and have a\nsignificant contribution to GHG emissions.3\nClimate change mitigation is a strategic priority for Guinea-Bissau, with the main objective of reducing\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thus contributing to the commitments made in the Paris Agreement\nand to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To guide decision-making and\ninform international partners, several mitigation assessment options have been developed, based on the\nelaboration of different emissions scenarios.\nDespite being one of the countries with the lowest global emissions, Guinea-Bissau has adopted a\nproactive approach in combating climate change, focussing on key sectors with mitigation potential. The\nmitigation programmes were designed taking into account national institutional capacity, resource\navailability and coherence with sustainable development plans. Mitigation scenarios are presented,\nexplaining the underlying assumptions and the methodology used to develop mitigation options.\n3.2. Description of the sectoral approaches used for the mitigation assessment\nAccording to the Revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC, 2021), access to energy is a social,\neconomic and environmental issue of great importance for Guinea-Bissau. The country’s electrification\nrate is still low, at no more than 45 percent in 2020, and the government plans to increase it to 80 percent\nby 2030.\nPrimary energy consumption is still dominated by biomass, which represents more than 80% of the\ncountry's primary energy demand. This is one of the main drivers of deforestation in Guinea-Bissau,\nalong with itinerant agriculture based on slash and burn techniques. This is an important issue for the\ncountry in terms of its energy matrix and energy production costs, noting that Guinea-Bissau imports fossil\nfuels to meet its needs and access to modern energy, for which there is a large and repressed demand.\nIn addition to emission reductions, mitigation measures based on clean energy and\nreforestation/afforestation will reduce the cost of energy production (reduce oil-based energy imports),\nreduce pressure on existing forests, ensure environmental protection and improve socio-economic\ndevelopment.\n\n1https://unfccc.int/NDCREG\n2https://unfccc.int/documents/645093\n3Guinea-Bissau National Inventory Report 2024: https://unfccc.int/documents/645094\n\n83\n\nThe mitigation assessments were based on a combination of three alternative approaches, namely: (i)\nactivity-based approach, (ii) results-based approach or (iii) a combination of the two approaches\n(WRI&UNDP, 2015). These types of mitigation activities (types of contribution) are illustrated in Figure\n3.1.\n\nNumber26: Types of mitigation contributions (WRI and UNDP, 2015)\nTotal GHG emission reductions or removals were calculated through the development of sectoral\nscenarios and alternative scenarios, based on several policy implementation assumptions. The tool used\nis the IPCC 2006 software, which uses data from 2025 to 2050 to model base and mitigation scenarios.\nThe use of base scenarios to calculate the emission reduction resulting from mitigation actions is\nillustrated in WRI and UNDP (2015), as can be seen in Figure 3.2.\n\n84\n\nNumber27: Determination of expected emissions in a future year if mitigation actions are implemented\n(WRI and UNDP, 2015).\n3. 3. Energy\n3.3.1. Overview of energy\nGuinea-Bissau has for decades been facing a structural crisis in the electricity sector, marked by low\ninstalled capacity, limited territorial coverage, obsolete infrastructure, high operating costs and a strong\ndependence on fossil fuels, especially in rural areas where access rates remain extremely low. The\nsituation has worsened over time, reflecting the lack of sustainable investments and an effective national\nstrategy for the development of the energy sector.\nIn response to this critical situation, the Government of Guinea-Bissau initiated in 2018 a strategic\npartnership with the Turkish company KARPOWER, through a contract for the supply of electricity\nthrough a floating thermoelectric power plant powered by Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). This unit currently\nrepresents the main source of electricity generation in the country, with an installed capacity of 24 MW\nin 2024, intended exclusively for the supply of the capital and adjacent areas. This partially stabilised\npower supply in the city of Bissau, an advance in the face of electricity shortages.\nIn addition to the floating plant, Guinea-Bissau's power generation system has three small-scale\nthermoelectric power plants located in Gabu, Bafatá and Canchungo, each with an installed capacity of\napproximately 1 MW. These plants operate in isolation, facing technical and financial limitations, as well\nas high operating costs due to the use of diesel. In total, the country's installed capacity is around 27 MW,\ninsufficient to meet domestic demand, representing a significant obstacle to the country's economic and\nsocial progress.\n\n3.3.2. Energy reference/baseline assumptions (2025-2050)\n\na) Thermal power generation\nCurrently, the cities of Gabu, Bafatá and Canchungo operate small isolated power plants, each with a\ncapacity of 1 MW and powered by diesel. The electricity generated is used for residential, commercial,\n\n85\n\ninstitutional and other purposes in these three locations. In the baseline scenario, no changes are expected\nbetween 2025 and 2050. The current configuration will be maintained, with the three thermoelectric\ngenerators remaining in operation and consuming approximately 6,183,529 litres of diesel per year.\nb) KARPOWER plant\nThe baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the current electricity supply model during the period\n2025-2050 without introducing structural reforms in the sector. The floating power plant KARPOWER\ncontinues to be the main source of generation, with a progressive increase in its capacity at an average\nrate of approximately 2% per year, with the objective of partially responding to the growth of demand in\nthe city of Bissau. The three existing thermal power plants in Gabu, Bafatá and Canchungo continue to\noperate on a limited basis, without expansion or modernisation, each maintaining 1 MW of installed\ncapacity. The energy matrix remains heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels, in particular HFO and\ndiesel, without the relevant incorporation of large-scale renewable sources. These assumptions were\nbased on EAGB data and the judgement of the national expert. The reference fuel consumption ranges\nfrom 25.259.333 litres to 41.447.124 litres.\n3.3.3. Impact of the baseline energy scenario (2025-2050)\n\na) Economic impact\nFrom an economic point of view, although the installed capacity of floating power plants is progressively\nincreasing at a rate of 2% per year, operational and generation costs remain high due to dependence on\nimported heavy fuel fuel (HFO). This reality tends to keep electricity out of reach of a large part of the\npopulation and limits the growth of productive sectors that depend on reliable and affordable energy. By\nnot developing a national energy production base, the country remains vulnerable to external shocks and\nloses some strategic autonomy. On the other hand, the expansion of installed capacity may not effectively\naccompany the continuous increase in demand, which feeds the risk of supply deficits and recurrent\nlosses in the electricity system.\n(b)Social impact\nAt the social level, the centralisation of energy supply in the city of Bissau contributes to the dynamics\nof urban growth, but accentuates the inequalities between the capital and the rest of the territory. In inland\nregions, the lack of regular access to electricity hampers the proper functioning of essential services such\nas health centres, schools and security infrastructure, and limits the emergence of sustainable economic\nactivities. Most rural people will continue to rely on one-off and unstable solutions, such as small\ngenerators or low-power solar kits, which reinforces energy exclusion and limits the possibilities for\nimproving living conditions.\nc) Environmental impact\nIn environmental terms, the continuity of generation from heavy fuels implies the maintenance of high\nlevels of pollutant emissions, with direct impacts on air quality, population health and coastal ecosystems.\nThe absence of a clear commitment to renewable sources undermines Guinea-Bissau's alignment with\nglobal energy transition goals and hinders the country's integration into regional climate mitigation\nstrategies. Without a change of course, the current model is unsustainable in the medium and long term,\nboth ecologically and financially.\n\n86\n\n3.3.4. Assumptions of energy mitigation scenarios (2025-2050)\nThe mitigation scenario considers the progressive implementation of strategic investments in the\nelectricity sector of Guinea-Bissau, with a view to diversifying the energy matrix, reducing dependence\non fossil fuels and expanding access to electricity in a more sustainable and balanced way in the national\nterritory. This scenario contemplates two main axes of intervention: (i) the installation of hybrid solar\nmini-grids replacing thermal generators in the regions of Gabu, Bafatá and Canchungo; and (ii) the entry\ninto operation of the OMVG (Organisation for the Mise en Valeur du fleuve Gambie) Interconnection\nProject, with access to renewable energy (hydroelectric) and lower operating cost.\na) Hybrid solar mini-grids\nToday, the cities of Gabu, Bafatá, and Canchungo operate with small, isolated thermal power plants, each\nwith a capacity of 1 MW, powered by diesel. In the mitigation scenario, this infrastructure will be\nprogressively replaced by solar mini-grids with the same capacity (1 MW each). The planned timetable\nis as follows: in 2025 the current model is maintained, with the three thermal generators still in operation.\nIn 2030, two of these generators, those from Bafatá and Gabu, will be replaced by solar mini-grids. In\n2035, the third mini-solar grid will be installed in Canchungo, completing the planned transition. As of\n2035, no further changes are expected in this segment, assuming the continuous operation and\nmaintenance of the solar infrastructure until 2050. Even so, it is estimated that about 5% of the electricity\ncontinues to be generated by diesel generators, for reserve purposes, support in consumption peaks or\nsituations of low solar radiation.\nb) Replacement of the KARPOWER plant with the OMVG interconnector\nIn the same mitigation scenario, it is considered that, from 2025, the supply of the city of Bissau will no\nlonger depend on the floating power plant KARPOWER, being replaced by electricity from the OMVG\nregional network, interconnected to neighbouring countries through an infrastructure already in the\nprocess of completion. OMVG's interconnected system supplies Guinea-Bissau with an initial capacity\nof 26 MW. The installed capacity of this system will increase at a rate of 2% per year by 2050.\n\n3.3.5. Impact of energy mitigation scenarios (2025-2050)\n\na) Economic impact\nReplacing the KARPOWER floating plant with supplies from OMVG and small generators with solar\nmini-grids will help the country spend less on imported fuels such as diesel. This means less risk with\nchanges in the price of oil. With cheaper and more stable energy, small companies will have better\nconditions for growth, above all in the interior of the country. It will also be possible to attract new\ninvestments in productive activities such as processing agricultural products and providing services.\nInstalling and maintaining solar mini-grids will create jobs and could help develop new technical skills\nin the country. In addition, the use of renewable sources improves energy security, as the country ceases\nto rely so much on external and costly solutions. In the long run, the model is more sustainable and can\nstrengthen the national economy in a more balanced way.\nb) Social impact\n\n87\n\nAlthough the project does not foresee the expansion of the power grid to new areas, replacing diesel\ngenerators with solar mini-grids will bring a significant improvement in the quality of power supply in\nthe localities of Gabu, Bafatá and Canchungo. With more stable electricity, less subject to frequent\nfailures and cuts, existing public services, such as schools, health centres, and administrative posts, can\nfunction more regularly and efficiently. Continuity of supply also facilitates the use of critical equipment,\nsuch as refrigeration systems for medicines or computers to support education. This energy reliability\nbrings more comfort and safety to families and small businesses, reducing dependence on individual\ngenerators or poor solutions. In addition, the installation and operation of the mini-grids creates local\nemployment opportunities and can stimulate the development of technical skills among young people in\nthe beneficiary communities.\nc) Environmental impact\nThe use of clean sources, such as solar energy and hydroelectric energy from OMVG, has a very positive\neffect on the environment. The replacement of diesel generators and the KARPOWER plant significantly\nreduces the emission of polluting gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which contribute to global\nwarming. It also reduces air pollution and the risk of soil and water contamination, which are common\nwhen using fossil fuels. In coastal areas, removing the floating plant helps protect the marine environment\nand prevents oil spills. This new energy model is more in line with Guinea-Bissau's international\nenvironmental commitments and shows that the country is moving towards a greener future. With this\nchange, the country also improves its international image and can attract support and financing related\nto environmental protection. In the long run, it's a healthier, cleaner and safer system for everyone.\n3.3.6. Emission analysis for baseline and mitigation scenarios for the energy sector\nThe simple results for the baseline and mitigation scenarios for both selected energy options (hybrid solar\nmini-grid and replacement of the KARPOWER plant by the OMVG interconnector) of the IPCC 2006\nsoftware are presented in the figure below.\n\n88\n\nNumber28:Visualisation of 2030 energy and emissions data in the 2006 IPCC software for thermal power\ngeneration/hybrid solar mini-grids (Scenario 1) and replacement of the KARPOWER plant (Scenario 2).\na) Replacement of thermal power generation by hybrid solar mini-grids\nIn the base scenario, there are no changes to the existing infrastructure. Diesel generators will continue\nto run at full capacity in all three cities until 2050, resulting in constant annual emissions of 16.8 kilotons\nof CO₂ equivalent. In the period 2025 to 2050, this equates to cumulative emissions of 436.8 kilotons of\nCO₂ equivalent.\nIn the mitigation scenario, diesel systems are progressively replaced by hybrid solar mini-grids,\nmaintaining the same capacity of 1 MW at each site. The transition follows the following schedule:\n 2025-2029: All three cities continue to use diesel, with emissions of 16.8 ktCO 2 per year.\n 2030-2034: Bafatá and Gabu are solarized, reducing annual emissions to 6.16 ktCO2e.\n 2035-2050: Canchungo also transitions to solar energy. At this point, 95% of electricity is\ngenerated from solar and 5% from backup diesel, keeping emissions stable at 0.84 ktCO₂e per\nyear.\nBy 2050, cumulative emissions in the mitigation scenario will total 128.2 kilotons of CO2 equivalent,\nleading to an overall reduction of 308.6 kilotons of CO2 equivalent compared to the initial value.\nTable 2-0-1: Baseline and mitigation for the replacement of thermoelectric power in hospitals by hybrid\nsolar mini-grids\nYears\nAnnual emissions\nreference scenario\n2025-2050\nCumulative emissions\nreference scenario\n2025-2050\nAnnual Emissions\nMitigation Scenario\n2025-2050\nCumulative emissions\nmitigation scenario\n2025-2050\n2025\n16.8\n16.8\n16.8\n16.8\n2026\n16.8\n33.6\n16.8\n33.6\n2027\n16.8\n50.4\n16.8\n50.4\n2028\n16.8\n67.2\n16.8\n67.2\n2029\n16.8\n84.0\n16.8\n84.0\n2030\n16.8\n100.8\n6.16\n90.2\n2031\n16.8\n117.6\n6.16\n96.3\n2032\n16.8\n134.4\n6.16\n102.5\n2033\n16.8\n151.2\n6.16\n108.6\n2034\n16.8\n168.0\n6.16\n114.8\n\n89\n\n2035\n16.8\n184.8\n0.84\n115.6\n2036\n16.8\n201.6\n0.84\n116.5\n2037\n16.8\n218.4\n0.84\n117.3\n2038\n16.8\n235.2\n0.84\n118.2\n2039\n16.8\n252.0\n0.84\n119.0\n2040\n16.8\n268.8\n0.84\n119.8\n2041\n16.8\n285.6\n0.84\n120.7\n2042\n16.8\n302.4\n0.84\n121.5\n2043\n16.8\n319.2\n0.84\n122.4\n2044\n16.8\n336.0\n0.84\n123.2\n2045\n16.8\n352.8\n0.84\n124.0\n2046\n16.8\n369.6\n0.84\n124.9\n2047\n16.8\n386.4\n0.84\n125.7\n2048\n16.8\n403.2\n0.84\n126.6\n2049\n16.8\n420.0\n0.84\n127.4\n2050\n16.8\n436.8\n0.84\n128.2\n\nNumber29:Cumulative emissions projection in reference and mitigation scenarios for replacement\nb) Replacement of the KARPOWER plant with the OMVG interconnector\nFor the period 2025-2050, emissions in the baseline scenario are expected to increase from 78.3 kilotons\nof CO₂e in 2025 to 128.8 kilotons of CO₂e in 2050. This increase is due to an annual growth of 2% in\ninstalled capacity, while the continued dependence on the KARPOWER plant fuelled by fossil fuels\nremains. In the same period, cumulative emissions in the reference scenario are estimated at 2,642.3\nkilotons of CO₂e.\n0,0\n50,0\n100,0\n150,0\n200,0\n250,0\n300,0\n350,0\n400,0\n450,0\n500,0\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\n2031\n2032\n2033\n2034\n2035\n2036\n2037\n2038\n2039\n2040\n2041\n2042\n2043\n2044\n2045\n2046\n2047\n2048\n2049\n2050\nProjeção de Emissões Cumulativas sob Referência e Cenários\nde Mitigação para Energia\nCumulative Emission 2025-2050 Ref scenarion\nCumulative Emission 2025-2050 Mitigation scenarion\n\n90\n\nWith the implementation of the mitigation measure, the replacement of the KARPOWER plant by the\nOMVG interconnector, which provides cleaner and more sustainable electricity, emissions are expected\nto increase more moderately, from 29.6 kilotons of CO2 equivalent in 2025 to 48.6 kilotons of CO2\nequivalent in 2050. Cumulative emissions under this mitigation scenario are projected at 997.9 kilotons\nof CO2 equivalent.\nTherefore, replacing the KARPOWER plant with the OMVG interconnector will result in a total\nreduction of 1,644.4 kilotons of CO2 by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario.\nTable 3-0-2: Baseline and mitigation for the replacement of the KARPOWER plant by the interconnector\nYears\nAnnual emissions\nreference scenario\n2025-2050\nCumulative emissions\nreference scenario\n2025-2050\nAnnual Emissions\nMitigation Scenario\n2025-2050\nCumulative emissions\nmitigation scenario 20252050\n2025\n78.5\n78.5\n29.6\n29.6\n2026\n80.1\n158.6\n30.2\n59.8\n2027\n81.7\n240.3\n30.8\n90.6\n2028\n83.3\n323.6\n31.4\n122.0\n2029\n85.0\n408.6\n32.0\n154.0\n2030\n86.7\n495.3\n32.7\n186.7\n2031\n88.4\n583.7\n33.3\n220.0\n2032\n90.2\n673.8\n34.0\n254.1\n2033\n92.0\n765.8\n34.7\n288.8\n2034\n93.8\n859.6\n35.4\n324.1\n2035\n95.7\n955.3\n36.1\n360.2\n2036\n97.6\n1053.0\n36.8\n397.0\n2037\n99.6\n1152.5\n37.5\n434.6\n2038\n101.6\n1254.1\n38.3\n472.9\n2039\n103.6\n1357.7\n39.1\n511.9\n2040\n105.4\n1463.1\n40.1\n552.0\n2041\n107.5\n1570.7\n40.9\n592.8\n2042\n109.7\n1680.4\n41.7\n634.5\n2043\n111.9\n1792.3\n42.5\n677.0\n2044\n114.1\n1906.4\n43.4\n720.4\n2045\n116.7\n2023\n44.0\n764.4\n2046\n119.0\n2142.0\n44.9\n809.3\n2047\n121.4\n2263.4\n45.8\n855.0\n2048\n123.8\n2387.2\n46.7\n901.7\n2049\n126.3\n2513.5\n47.6\n949.3\n2050\n128.8\n2642.3\n48.6\n997.9\n\n91\n\nFigure 3.4: Projection of cumulative emissions in reference and mitigation scenarios for the replacement\nof the KARPOWER plant by the OMVG interconnector\n\n3.4. Agriculture and Land Use\nGuinea-Bissau, situated in West Africa, is characterised by a wide coastline, wetlands and tropical\nforests, including important mangrove ecosystems. These natural environments have historically played\nan essential role in carbon sequestration, climate regulation and protection against coastal erosion.\nHowever, in the absence of effective climate change mitigation and adaptation policies, particularly in\nthe forest sector, the country continues to lose significant areas of vegetation cover, including mangroves,\ndue to agricultural expansion, logging, disorderly urbanisation and coastal erosion caused by rising sea\nlevels.\nIn the absence of reforestation, projects or policies (trees and mangroves), lack of environmental\noversight, population growth without territorial planning, and energy poverty, the following\nconsequences may occur:\n3.4.1. Baseline scenario for the agricultural sector and related impacts\n\n Average rate of deforestation: 1.5% per year in dry and wet forests.\n Estimated mangrove loss: 30% by 2050, due to soil salinisation, rising sea levels and farm use\nand firewood.\na) Impact on GHG emissions:\n Increased net CO₂ emissions: Forests and mangroves, which acted as carbon sinks, become net\nsources of emissions.\n Estimated additional emissions (2025–2050):\n0,0\n500,0\n1000,0\n1500,0\n2000,0\n2500,0\n3000,0\n2025 2027 2029 2031 2033 2035 2037 2039 2041 2043 2045 2047 2049\nProjeção de Emissões Cumulativas sob Referência e\nCenários de Mitigação para Energia\nCumulative Emission 2025-2050 Ref scenarion\nCumulative Emission 2025-2050 Mitigation scenarion\n\n92\n\n Degraded forests corresponding to the loss of sequestration capacity: -4,097 kilotons of CO2e\n(2022 to 2030)Projections for (2030 to 2050) point to an absorption of -15,903 GgCO₂eq, which\ncould reach -10,068 GgCO₂eq by 2050. Therefore, the loss of sequestration capacity: - 5.835\nGgCO2eq (2030 to 2050).\nb) Environmental and social impacts:\n Increased frequency and intensity of coastal flooding.\n Reduction of marine and terrestrial biodiversity.\n Food insecurity, due to decreased agricultural productivity caused by soil impoverishment and\nclimate instability.\n Environmental internal migration (climate migrants).\n Increased reliance on international aid to deal with natural disasters.\nWithout strategic actions aimed at reforestation (of trees and mangroves), environmental conservation,\nespecially in the protection of forest and coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, Guinea-Bissau will face\na significant increase in its greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to multiple socioeconomic and\necological consequences.\nThis baseline scenario is essential as a basis for assessing the potential benefits of alternative scenarios\nwith proactive mitigation interventions such as reforestation, sustainable land management and\nmangrove conservation.\n3.4.2. Mitigation scenario for the agricultural and land use sector\nThe overall objective of the Mitigation Scenario is to significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissions\nand increase Guinea-Bissau's climate resilience by restoring vegetation cover, with special attention to\nreforestation (trees and mangroves) of degraded areas and their conservation, especially of coastal\nmangroves.\nWith the implementation of the project and the policies of reforestation (trees and mangroves),\nenvironmental inspection and demographic growth with territorial planning, one can expect:\na) Reforestation and Agroforestry\nObjective: To reforest 2000 hectares every five years, starting from degraded areas by 2050, i.e. this\nquantity of hectares may even double (4000 ha), if conditions are right for its implementation.\nMethod: planting native species combined with sustainable agricultural crops (agroforestry).\nCo-benefits: increasing agricultural productivity, restoring soil, creating green jobs.\nb) Rehabilitation and Conservation of Mangroves\nObjective: Restore 14,241 hectares of mangroves by 2050.\nMethod: mapping of degraded areas, community mobilisation, use of assisted natural regeneration\ntechniques.\nCo-benefits: coastal protection, increased artisanal fishing, carbon sequestration.\nc) Creation of Conservation Units and Environmental Surveillance\n\n93\n\nNew protected areas: 3 nature parks and 5 community reserves.\nInstitutional strengthening: training of forest guards, use of drones and satellites for monitoring.\ne)Environmental Education and Community Empowerment\nAwareness campaigns: on the importance of mangroves and forests.\nSchool and community programmes: involving young people and local leaders in sustainable\nmanagement.\n\n3.4.3. Expected impacts on emissions (GHG mitigation)\nTable 3-0-3: Estimated sequestered emissions (2025 to 2050)\n\nEmission source / hijacking\n\nEstimated reduction/sequestration by 2050\nReforestation (2000 ha)\n-16.19 GgCO2\nMangrove reclamation\n-1295.09GgCO2\nEstimated total\n-1311.29GgCO2\n\nEconomic: generating about 1,000 direct green jobs (nurseries, reforestation, ecotourism, monitoring).\nSocial: improvement of food and water security; valorisation of local products.\nEcological: restoration of biodiversity, improvement of soil and water quality.\nAdaptation: better protection against coastal storms and prolonged droughts.\nConditions of Success\nInternational climate finance: through mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund (FCV).\nTechnical partnerships: with NGOs, universities and multilateral organisations.\nCommunity involvement: focussing on rural and coastal populations.\nRobust public policies: integrating climate mitigation into national development plans.\nThis alternative mitigation scenario offers Guinea-Bissau the opportunity to lead a sustainable\ndevelopment model adapted to its ecological and social reality. Investing in reforestation of trees and\nmangroves not only reduces GHG emissions, but also strengthens food sovereignty, the local economy\nand the country’s ability to address future climate challenges.\n3.4.4. Emission analysis for baseline/reference and mitigation scenarios for the Agriculture and\nLand Use sector\nFor the reference situation, that is, the absence of the reforestation project (trees and mangroves) and\nother public policies and government strategies in the country, the results of the calculation of the IPCC\n2006 software, report that the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) is zero (0) between the years (2025 to\n2050), this implies the non-occurrence of any type of sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the\natmosphere.\n\n94\n\nIt should also be noted that, in this situation (reference), given the non-implementation of the project and\nother public policies and strategies, the capacity to sequester greenhouse gases is zero, from the\nperspective of values or results of calculations of the IPCC 2006 software. But, in accordance with the\nneeds of the population, activities to cut and use forest resources irrationally thus continue to increase\ngreenhouse gas emissions, while sink capacity gradually decreases.\nRegarding the mitigation situation, with the implementation of the project and other public policies and\ngovernment strategies between the years (2025 to 2050), the results of the IPCC 2006 software\ndemonstrate a large gradual capacity of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in the atmosphere.\n\nTable 3-0-4: GgCO2eq removal trend in the mitigation situation (2025 – 2050)\nYear\n\nMitigation Situation\n\nTree\nMangroves\n2025\n\n0.00\n0.00\n2030\n\n-1.08\n-82.19\n2035\n\n-2.16\n-231.03\n2040\n\n-3.24\n-277.74\n2045\n\n-4.32\n-328.75\n2050\n\n-5.40\n-375.38\n\nFigure 3.5.Removal trend in the mitigation situation (2025-2050)\n-400,00\n-300,00\n-200,00\n-100,00\n0,00\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\n2045\n2050\nGg CO2\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\n2045\n2050\nSituação de Mitigação\nÁrvore\n0,00\n-1,08\n-2,16\n-3,24\n-4,32\n-5,40\nSituação de Mitigação\nMangrove\n0,00\n-82,19\n-231,03\n-277,74\n-328,75\n-375,38\nSituação de atenuação FOLU (2025-2050)\n\n95\n\nFigure 3.6: Trend of CO2 removal in the reference and mitigation situation (2025-2050)\n\n3.5. Analysis of total reduced emissions\nThe replacement of the KARPOWER plant by the OMVG interconnector represents the main\ncontribution to the total emission reduction (1,644.4 ktCO2eq in 2050), followed by mangrove planting\nand the hybrid mini-grid. If all the proposed mitigation options are implemented simultaneously, the total\nemission reduction will reach 2,357.18 ktCO2eq in 2050. Reforestation and planting of mangroves will\nat some point contribute to adaptation to climate change.\nTable 3-0-5:Total emissions reduced ktCO2eq\nYears\nHybrid solar\nmini-grids\nReplacement of the\nKARPOWER plant with the\nOMVG interconnector\nReforestation\nMangrove\nplantation\nTo reduce\nemissions\ncompletely\n2025\n-\n48.90\n-\n-\n48.90\n2030\n10.60\n308.60\n1.08\n82.19\n415.27\n2035\n69.20\n595.10\n2.16\n231.03\n1,220.89\n2040\n149.00\n911.10\n3.24\n277.74\n1,364.48\n2045\n228.80\n1,258.60\n4.32\n328.75\n1,843.87\n2050\n308.60\n1,644.40\n5.40\n375.38\n2,357.18\n\n-400,00\n-200,00\n0,00\nGg CO2\n2025\n2030\n2035\n2040\n2045\n2050\nSituação de referência\nÁrvores\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\nSituação de referência\nMangrove\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\n0,00\nSituação de Mitigação\nÁrvore\n0,00\n-1,08\n-2,16\n-3,24\n-4,32\n-5,40\nSituação de Mitigação\nMangrove\n0,00\n-82,19\n-231,03\n-277,74\n-328,75\n-375,38\nSituação de referência e atenuação FOLU (2025-2050)\n\n96\n\nFigure 30: Total emissions reduced from 2025 to 2050\n3.5.

PROGRAMMES CONTAINING MEASURES TO ADAPTAT ON CLIMATE\nCHANGE\n4.1. National Circumstances, Institutional Arrangements and Legal Framework\n4.1.1. National circumstances\n\nGuinea-Bissau has signed and ratified the main agreements of the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change (UNFCCC). In 1995, it ratified the UNFCCC; in 2005, it ratified the Kyoto Protocol\n(RGB, 2011), and in 2016, it signed the Paris Agreement. Guinea-Bissau has made significant progress:\nin 2001, it published its First National Communication on Climate Change, which formed the basis for\nthe most concise document of the National Action Plan on Adapting to Climate Change (PANA),\npublished in December 2006.\nPANA is a set of diagnoses on the socio-environmental context of the country, as well as proposals for\ntechnical solutions to climate challenges. The PANA identified the rural regions and the productive\nactivities developed in them, such as agriculture, fishing, livestock and forest extraction, as the most\nsusceptible to changes in rainfall patterns and the occurrence of extreme events (RGB, 2006).\nThe document on Strengthening the Resilience and Adaptation Capacity of the Agricultural and Water\nSectors to Climate Change in Guinea-Bissau (PRCASAHMC-GB) (RGB, 2011) underlines that rising\nsea levels, as well as building coastal stands, can contribute to the loss of coastal floodplains and\nmangroves, causing crop losses due to the salinisation of rice paddies. Possible changes in rainfall\npatterns can impact current food security strategies, increase child malnutrition and cause an increase in\ncases of heat wave-related diseases and deaths, floods, storms and similar events.\n4.1.2. Institutional arrangements\nThe Ministry of Environment and Biodiversity (MABAC) is the main body providing guidance on\npolicies, legal issues and other documents related to the environment and biodiversity, including climate\nchange. The National Environment Institute (INA) plays a key technical role in the National Committee\non Climate Change (NCCC). The INA is responsible for providing technical and scientific support,\ncoordinating activities related to environmental impact assessment, contributing to the development of\nadaptation policies and strategies and assisting in the practical implementation of adaptation measures,\nin collaboration with other institutions involved.\nThe National Committee on Climate Change (CNAC) of Guinea-Bissau is composed of several\ngovernment institutions and relevant organisations that collaborate in the formulation and\nimplementation of policies related to climate change. The main entities that make up the CNAC include:\n- Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC): Body responsible for the overall\ncoordination of the country's environmental and biodiversity policies.\n- National Environment Institute (INA): Provides technical and scientific support, coordinating activities\nrelated to environmental impact assessment and contributing to the development of adaptation strategies.\nIn addition to these institutions, the NCCC may include representatives of other relevant ministries and\nentities, such as the Ministries of Agriculture, Fisheries, Water Resources, Health and Energy, as well as\n\n100\n\nnon-governmental organisations (NGOs), research centres and institutes, civil society and international\npartners involved in climate issues. This multidisciplinary approach allows an integrated and effective\nresponse to the challenges posed by climate change in Guinea-Bissau.\nBelow is an organisation chart that clearly illustrates how the various institutions and institutional\narrangements are linked to key policies and processes related to adaptation, such as NAPA, NDC, the\nNAP process and interactions with the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Global Environment Facility\n(GEF).\n\nFigure 31: Organisation chart of institutional arrangements related to climate change adaptation issues.\nCurrent institutional arrangements have been instrumental in facilitating coordinated adaptation actions.\nThe National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC) plays a central role in coordination between the\nrelevant government institutions. Despite these efforts, there are still challenges related to limited\ninstitutional capacity and the need for a more robust integration of adaptation actions into the regular\noperations of public institutions. Strengthening institutional capacity and improving inter-institutional\ncommunication are priority areas for ensuring the effectiveness of adaptation actions.\nThe effectiveness of existing institutional arrangements is also related to the technical and administrative\ncapacity of the government institutions involved, especially in terms of specialised human resources,\nadequate infrastructure and access to the necessary technologies. Continuous improvement of these\ncapabilities is essential to ensure that institutions are able to effectively implement adaptation actions and\nintegrate them into their day-to-day operations.\n4.1.3. Legal framework related to climate change\nConsiderations and planning for adaptation to climate change in Guinea-Bissau are at an early stage of\ndevelopment. Although some climate change integration activities have been carried out in the\nframework of the implementation of the project \"Strengthening Climate Change Resilience and Adaptive\nCapacity in Guinea-Bissau's Agricultural and Water Sectors\", the country faces major challenges, mainly\nMINISTRY OF\nENVIRONMENT,\nBIODIVERSITY AND\nCLIMATE ACTION (MABAC)\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT\nINSTITUTE (INA)\n RELEVANT MINISTRIES\n(Environment, Economy, Plan and\nInt. Regional, Agriculture, Women,\nFamily, Natural Resources, Energy,\netc.)\n PRIVATE SECTOR\n NGOs\n CIVIL SOCIETY\n RESEARCH CENTRES INST.\n ... ...\nNATIONAL CLIMATE\nCHANGE COMMITTEE\n(NCCC)\nNATIONAL\nCOMMUNICATIO\nNS (CN –\nPROJECTS FINANCED\nBY GCF/GEF\nRELATED POLICIES AND PROCESSES\nBIENNIAL\nTRANSPARENCY\nREPORTS (BTR)\nNATIONAL\nADAPTATION\nPLAN (NAP process)\nNATIONALLY\nDETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTIONS (NCDS)\nNATIONAL ADAPTATION\nACTION PROGRAMME\n(NAPA)\n\n101\n\ndue to the absence of a National Climate Change Policy Table and an established national adaptation\nplanning process. It is therefore necessary to create an enabling environment to facilitate the integration\nof adaptation measures into national development objectives and to strengthen the capacity of the\nMinistry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action, which is responsible for the development of\nenvironmental and climate change adaptation policies.\nThe table below presents some policies and plans on climate change:\nTable 4-0-1: Climate Change Policies and Plans\nPolicies/Plans\nDescription\nParis Agreement.\nGuinea-Bissau is a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and ratified the Paris Agreement in April 2016.\nNational Determined\nContribution (NDC).\nGuinea-Bissau submitted its National Contribution (Expected) in September\n2015. The document includes mitigation and adaptation components. The NDC\nwas inspired by the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (DENARP II) and is\naligned with the Strategic and Operational Plan - Terra Ranka 2015-2025.\nGuinea-Bissau's contribution to mitigation includes the implementation of\npolicies and actions planned in the forestry and energy sectors. Their contribution\nto adaptation broadly identifies agriculture, the coastal zone, cross-cutting areas,\ndisaster risk management, education, energy, environment, health and tourism as\nareas requiring adaptation actions. It also identifies gaps and needs, as well as\nhigh-level adaptation objectives. One of these shortcomings is the need to carry\nout a cost-benefit analysis of adaptation measures. According to the updated 2021\nNDC, the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures depends on\nexternal partners that provide financial resources, technology, and training.\nAlthough the impacts and vulnerabilities of climate change are presented, they\nare based on NAPA (2006) and, therefore, are considered outdated.\nNational Action Plan for\nAdaptation (NAPA, 2006).\nPANA has identified several priority strategic actions to address the risks and\nimpacts of climate change in Guinea-Bissau. These actions aim to increase the\nfood security of rural populations in order to increase their resilience, reduce\npressure on forest and fishing resources and improve access to drinking water.\nPANA prioritises agriculture and tourism, as well as water resources, coastal\nerosion and biodiversity.\nThird National\nCommunication (TNC).\nThe 2018 TCN presents, among other aspects, the climate-induced impacts and\nsuggested adaptation needs for the main sectors of agriculture and livestock,\nenergy, forestry, biodiversity, fisheries and water resources. The TCN proposes\na series of adaptation measures. For the water sector, it proposes:\nEstablishing a coherent and consistent strategy, using an integrated\napproach to water resources management and increasing rainwater\nharvesting and storage capacity to increase surface and groundwater\nreserves. For the agricultural sector, it proposes a range of\nadaptation measures that vary across ecosystems. These ecosystems\nare those of mangroves, the Bas-Fonds (freshwater), those of the\nplateau and those of backyard agriculture.\nHyogo Table/Sendai Table.\nUnder the Hyogo Framework/Sendai Framework, Guinea-Bissau has been\nmaking efforts since 2010 to develop its capacity in Disaster Risk\nReduction/Disaster Risk Management (DRR/DRM), which led to the adoption of\n\n102\n\nthe National Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction and the creation and\noperationalisation of the National Civil Protection Service (SNPC).\n4.2. Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities\n4.2.1. Analysis of past and future climate change projections\nAvailable information on past climate change indicates general trends, such as the increase in average\nannual temperature and changes in precipitation patterns, reported mainly by the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC) in its global and regional assessment reports (IPCC, 2014; IPCC, 2021) and\nthe new climate scenarios for Guinea-Bissau 2016 - 2045, provided by the National Institute of\nMeteorology (INM), there is a gradual increase in temperatures, accompanied by variability in\nprecipitation regimes and a higher frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and intense rainfall.\nLooking ahead, climate projections indicate that these trends will continue, with further increases in\naverage temperatures, intensification of extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation patterns.\nSpecifically, the IPCC climate models suggest that Guinea-Bissau could face significant increases in\naverage annual temperature, ranging from 1.5 °C to 3 °C by 2100, depending on the emissions scenario\nconsidered (IPCC, 2021).\nThe new climate scenarios project significant changes in the climate of Guinea-Bissau. Systematic\nincreases in average daily temperature are expected to reach +1.4 °C in the period 2016-2045 and +2.2\n°C in the period 2046-2075, according to Scenario CRP4.5 (low emissions); and from +1.6 °C to +3.1\n°C in the period 2046-2075, according to Scenario RCP8.5 (high emissions).\nFor the maximum daily temperature, the average of the regional climate models used indicates an\nincrease in the order of +1.2 °C [+0.8 °C to +1.7 °C] on the coast (Bissau and Bolama) to +1.4 °C [+1.0\n°C to +1.6 °C] in the interior and east, according to Scenario RCP4.5 (low emissions), for the period\n2016-2045 compared to Normal 1961-1990. An increase from +1.3 °C [+0.9 °C to 2.0 °C] on the coast\nto +1.5 °C [+1.2 °C to 2.1 °C] inland according to Scenario RCP8.5 (high emissions) for the period 20162045 compared to Normal 1961-1990 (see Figure 33).\n\nNumber32: Projections of maximum daily temperature (ºC) changes for the period (2016-2045): a)\nscenario RCP4.5 (low emissions) and b) scenario RCP8.5 (high emissions).\n\n103\n\nRegarding precipitation, the average of the fourteen models used in the simulations indicates a slight\nincrease in average daily precipitation of +10% for the period 2016-2045, according to Scenario RCP4.5\n(Low emissions). For Scenario RCP8.5 (\"High Emissions\"), a climatologically identical situation to\nNormal is expected (without significant variations from the reference period: 1961-1990), with the\nexception of the southwestern part of the Bijagós Archipelago and the southern part of the Tombali\nRegion (Cacine Sector), where an increase of +5% is expected.\nAverage Daily Precipitation (in %) 2016-2045; Scenario RCP4.5 (\"low emissions\"), the average of the\nset of models used in the simulations projects a slight increase in average daily precipitation, in the order\nof +3% [+2% to +5%] in almost all the national territory, except for the southwestern part of the Bijagós\nArchipelago, where an increase between +5% and +10% is expected. For Scenario RCP8.5 (\"high\nemissions\"), a climatologically identical situation to Normal is expected (without significant variations\nfrom the reference period: 1961-1990), with the exception of the southwestern part of the Bijagós\nArchipelago and the southern part of the Tombali Region (Canine Sector) where a slight increase of about\n+2% to +5% is expected.\n\nNumber33: Projections of average daily precipitation changes (in %) for the period (2016-2045): (a)\nscenario RCP4.5 (low emissions) and (b) scenario RCP8.5 (high emissions)\n\nHowever, it is important to highlight the significant uncertainties associated with these projections,\nespecially due to the scarcity of detailed historical data and the limited spatial resolution of climate\nmodels available for the region. In addition, the absence of specific national studies contributes to\nadditional uncertainty regarding the exact magnitude of the projected changes and their detailed impacts\non the territory and communities of Guinea-Bissau (UNDP, 2020; GEF, 2021).\nFor the scenarios of average sea level rise, according to the MAGICC SCENGEN Model, version 5.1,\nan increase of approximately 1.5 million is expected by 2020, 6.5 cm, and will reach 1.5 million by 2050,\n20 cm. These sea level rises, combined with coastal erosion, can have drastic consequences for low-lying\ncountries and small islands such as Guinea-Bissau, particularly affecting the country's economy,\nespecially populations living in coastal areas and their livelihoods.\n\n104\n\n4.2.2. Impacts, risks and vulnerabilities in important socio-economic sectors\nAvailable assessments, including reports produced by the Third National Communication to the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other international organisations,\nhighlight significant impacts on Guinea-Bissau's main socio-economic sectors resulting from current and\nfuture climate risks.\nAccording to historical data (Directorate-General for Water Services/MRN), coastal flooding caused by\nhigh tides or torrential rains (such as those observed in 2003, 2004 and 2005) affected the eastern regions\nof the country (Bafatá and Gabú). This has caused damage to infrastructure (bridges and substandard\nhousing), the loss of 63 hectares of food crops and the interruption of the work of hundreds of people,\nwho have been forced to leave their villages temporarily or permanently.\nThe floods would come mainly from the tributaries of the Geba rivers and the shared tributaries of the\nKoliba (Guinea-Conakry) and Corubal (Guinea-Bissau) rivers.\nIn the eastern zone, dust waves from the Sahara Desert, drought, and rising temperatures can increase\nthe allocation of cereals, mainly staple corn, horse corn, and sorghum.\nThe main risks of climate change already felt in the country are:\n▪ Temperature increase;\n▪ Change in precipitation;\n▪ Sea level rise;\n▪ Ocean warming and acidification.\n\nAgricultural sector\nThe agricultural sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change, with prolonged droughts, irregular\nrainfall and frequent flooding reducing productivity and affecting food security. Small farmers in rural\nareas are most affected because of their direct dependence on climatic conditions for subsistence and\ncommercial cultivation.\n\nNumber34Subject: Horticulture for adapting agriculture to climate change\nFishing Sector\n\n105\n\nThe fisheries sector, which is crucial for the national economy and food security of coastal communities,\nfaces significant risks due to rising sea levels, rising ocean temperatures and extreme weather events.\nThese changes directly threaten marine and coastal ecosystems, essential for the reproduction and\nmaintenance of fish species.\n\nNumber35:Subject: Market supply/artisanal fishermen\nUrban area\nUrban areas, particularly the capital, Bissau, are increasingly vulnerable frequent flooding and flooding,\nimpacting critical infrastructure, housing and public health services. Vulnerable urban populations,\nincluding women, children and marginalised communities, face increased risks due to lack of adequate\ninfrastructure and limited capacity to respond to climate emergencies.\n\nNumber36:Subject: Urban flooding in Guinea-Bissau\nWater and Coastal Zone\n\n106\n\nIrregular rainfall and rising temperatures would lead to a decrease in river flow and a reduction in the\nabstraction of groundwater to supply the population. Groundwater quality would also be negatively\nimpacted. Groundwater salinity is also expected to increase, compounded by rising sea levels.\nThe coastal zone will be affected by rising sea levels in the form of tropical storms, coastal erosion and\nfloods in low-lying areas. The oceans will become more acidic, which at some point will have an impact\non marine productivity, marine food chains and, consequently, on the availability of fisheries resources.\nImpacts on rural populations and vulnerable social groups\nRural populations and vulnerable social groups, especially women and children, face additional\nchallenges due to direct exposure to extreme events and limited adaptability. Women, responsible for\nmuch of family farming and natural-resource management, are disproportionately affected by climate\nchange.\nThese analyses emphasise the urgent need for integrated policies and concrete actions for adaptation and\nresilience, considering the socio-economic and cultural particularities of Guinea-Bissau, to protect and\nstrengthen the sectors and communities most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.\n4.3. Priorities and barriers to adaptation to climate change in Guinea-Bissau\nGuinea-Bissau has made progress in implementing climate change adaptation strategies despite structural\nand financial challenges. National priorities reflect the need to protect ecosystems, ensure food security,\nstrengthen infrastructure and promote sustainable development.\n4.3.1. National priorities for climate adaptation\nGuinea-Bissau's national priorities for adaptation to climate change are outlined in a series of policy and\nstrategic documents that reflect the country's commitment to addressing the challenges posed by climate\nchange. The main document setting out these priorities is the National Action Plan for Adapting to\nClimate Change (PANA), drawn up in 2006. This plan identified three sectors as the most vulnerable —\nagriculture, water and coastal areas — that remain central to the latest policies and strategies, including\nthe Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) updated in 2021.\n\n Agricultural Sector:\n\nAgriculture is highly dependent on climatic conditions and forms the basis of the livelihood of a large\npart of the rural population. The sector faces significant risks due to rainfall variability, rising average\ntemperatures, prolonged droughts and soil degradation. These factors reduce agricultural productivity,\nundermine food security, and exacerbate poverty in rural communities.\n\nThe national priority is therefore to develop the adaptability of agro-pastoral and forestry production\nsystems, by promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices, crop diversification and strengthening the\nsustainable\nmanagement\nof\nnatural\nresources.\nThese actions are aligned with the commitments of NDC 2021, which highlight agriculture as a key\nsector for strengthening community resilience and food security, directly contributing to SDG 2 (Zero\nHunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Terrestrial Life).\n\n107\n\n Water Resources:\n\nWater availability and quality are under increasing pressure due to reduced precipitation, salinisation of\nsurface and groundwater in coastal regions and watershed degradation. These risks undermine the supply\nof drinking water, agricultural irrigation and the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems.\n\nThus, one of the main priorities is to promote the integrated management of water resources, ensuring\nbetter hydro-meteorological monitoring, planning of water use and protection of recharge areas and water\nsources.\n\nNDC 2021 reinforces this priority by proposing actions for sustainable and integrated management of\nsurface and groundwater, and institutional strengthening for water governance. These measures\ncontribute to the fulfilment of SDG 6 (Drinking Water and Sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).\n\n Coastal Zone:\n\nThe coastal zone of Guinea-Bissau, characterised by extensive mangroves and low-lying islands, is\nparticularly vulnerable to sea level rise, coastal erosion, saline intrusion and loss of coastal ecosystems.\nThese phenomena affect infrastructure, riverine communities, and livelihoods based on fishing and\nfloodplain farming.\n\nPriorities for adaptation focus on protecting and restoring coastal ecosystems, coastal spatial planning,\nand reducing risks of flooding and erosion through green infrastructure and nature-based solutions.\n\nThese actions are reaffirmed in NDC 2021, which proposes interventions to increase the resilience of\ncoastal and marine ecosystems and protect vulnerable communities. These measures are aligned with\nSDG 14 (Life on Water), SDG 15 (Life on Land) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).\n\nTogether, these priorities form the basis for existing adaptation policies and guide the integration of\nclimate resilience into national and local development plans. NDC 2021 reinforces this commitment by\nproposing an integrated approach to adaptation and mitigation that directly contributes to the\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, consolidating Guinea-Bissau's role as\na country committed to environmental sustainability, reducing vulnerability and strengthening the\nadaptability of its communities and ecosystems.\n\n4.3.2. Barriers to adaptation\nGuinea-Bissau faces several barriers that hamper its ability to effectively adapt to climate change. The\nmain limitations include a lack of specialised technical capacity, insufficient financial resources and\ninstitutional challenges. These limitations make it difficult to implement the adaptation strategies needed\nto deal with adverse climate impacts.\nTo overcome these barriers, the country needs specific support in several areas:\n\n108\n\n- Institutional Strengthening and Technical Training: It is crucial to develop and improve the technical\ncapacities of national institutions to plan and implement adaptation actions. This includes continuing\ntraining for professionals and strengthening government structures responsible for environmental and\nclimate management.\n-Access to International Climate Finance: Getting financial resources from international funds is\nessential to enable adaptation projects. Guinea-Bissau needs assistance to prepare competitive bids and\nmeet the criteria required by global funders.\n- Transfer of Appropriate Technologies: The introduction of sustainable and locally adapted technologies\ncan increase the resilience of vulnerable sectors such as agriculture and water management. This includes\nclimate-resilient farming practices and efficient water-use systems.\n\n- Community Involvement and Public Awareness: The involvement of local communities in the\nadaptation process is essential. Education and awareness programmes can empower populations to adopt\nadaptive practices and actively participate in the implementation of solutions.\nAddressing these specific needs will allow Guinea-Bissau to strengthen its resilience to climate change\nand promote sustainable and inclusive development.\n4.4. Adaptation strategies, policies, plans, targets and actions to integrate adaptation to climate\nchange in Guinea-Bissau\nOngoing national adaptation policy processes often include strategic initiatives coordinated by different\ninstruments and approaches, such as National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs), National Action Programmes for Adaptation (NAPs) and the integration of\nadaptation into national development plans. Here is a detailed description of each of these processes:\n4.4.1. National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NAP)\nThe NAP is currently under development in Guinea-Bissau with the support of international partners\nsuch as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Green Climate Fund (VCF). The\ncentral objective of the NAP is to strengthen the national capacity to identify, prioritise and implement\neffective adaptation measures in key sectors. This process involves:\n(a) the diagnosis and assessment of climate vulnerabilities, especially in priority sectors such as\nagriculture, water, forestry, the coastal zone, health and infrastructure;\n(b) national and regional multi-stakeholder consultations to ensure social inclusion, gender equity and\ncommunity participation in adaptation decisions;\n(c) develop sector-specific adaptation strategies, including detailed programmes and actions, with clear\ntimelines and budget estimates;\n(d) identification of financing and capacity building needs, including the development of technical,\ninstitutional and human capacities for the effective implementation of the NAP;\n\n109\n\n(e) Integrate the NAP into sectoral and regional policies and plans, increase coherence with sustainable\ndevelopment policies, poverty reduction strategies and local territorial plans.\n4.4.2. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)\nThe NDCs represent a strategic commitment of Guinea-Bissau under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC).\nThe country submitted its first NDC in 2015, recently updated in 2021. As regards adaptation, the NDC\nsets out priority actions to increase national resilience to climate impacts, involving:\n(a) restoration and protection of coastal and marine ecosystems, with particular attention to mangroves,\nwhich are essential for natural flood protection and coastal erosion;\n(b) promote resilience and climate-friendly farming practices, including drought-resistant varieties,\nsustainable water management and agro-ecological techniques;\nc) Strengthen national early warning and climate risk management systems by increasing institutional\ncapacity for a rapid and effective response to climate emergencies;\nd) Strengthen technical and scientific capacity through investment in applied climate research,\nenvironmental education and specialised technical training;\ne) Mobilising international climate finance to complement national resources for the effective\nimplementation of the proposed measures.\nThe updated NDC of Guinea-Bissau (2021) reaffirms and consolidates the priority actions of adaptation\npreviously identified in the National Adaptation Action Plan (NAPA, 2006) and other national strategic\ndocuments, such as the Second National Communication (SCN) and the National Plan for Economic and\nSocial Development (PNDES).\nIn particular, NDC 2021:\n\nReconfirms the most vulnerable sectors — agriculture, water, coastal areas, forests/ecosystems,\nfisheries and health — as priorities for adaptation.\n\nIt resumes and updates the structural measures proposed in NAPA, but with a greater focus on\nintegrating adaptation actions into development policies and on strengthening institutional and\ncommunity climate resilience.\n\nIt is linked to the PANA-GB (National Environmental Action Plan) and the National Investment\nPlan for Adaptation (NAP) in preparation, aiming at coherence between planning instruments.\nIn summary:\nYes, Guinea-Bissau’s NDC 2021 reconfirms the priority actions for adaptation outlined in NAPA and\nother national documents, keeping the same vulnerable sectors as the central focus of the national\nadaptation strategy.\n4.4.3. National Action Programmes for Adaptation (NSAPs)\nGuinea-Bissau's National Climate Action Plan (PANA), developed in 2006, was the first strategic\napproach to address climate change challenges in the country, serving as an emergency plan for\n\n110\n\nimmediate priority actions. PANA initially identified the most vulnerable sectors and areas and proposed\nconcrete actions to reduce climate vulnerability. Key actions highlighted include:\na) Integrated management of water resources to ensure safe and sustainable access to water, especially\nin periods of prolonged drought;\n(b) promoting food security through crop diversification, the introduction of climate-resilient farming\ntechniques and the improvement of traditional farming practices;\nc) Protect and restore forests and mangroves, recognising the importance of these ecosystems for local\nand regional climate stability;\nd) improving public health systems, especially in the management of climate-sensitive diseases such as\nmalaria and diarrheal diseases;\ne) Raising awareness and empowering the community for the participatory management of natural\nresources and adaptation to climate change.\nCurrently, many actions initiated by PANA continue to be developed and deepened in the PNA and the\nNDC, creating continuity and strategic complementarity.\n4.4.4. Integrating Adaptation into National and Sectoral Development Plans\nGuinea-Bissau has adopted an integrated approach to adaptation, aligning climate objectives with\nnational policies and sectoral development plans, such as:\na) Strategic and Operational Plan \"Terra Ranka\" (2015–2025): This document includes adaptation as\none of the pillars to promote sustainable development and economic and environmental resilience;\nb) National Strategy for Poverty Reduction and Growth: Highlights actions to reduce social,\nenvironmental and economic vulnerabilities to climate change;\nc) Agricultural and Rural Sector Master Plan: explicitly provides for integrated climate actions to\nincrease agricultural productivity and food security, reducing the negative impacts of extreme weather\nevents;\nd) National Plan for Integrated Water Resources Management: Aims to ensure the availability and\nquality of water, especially in the face of climate variability;\ne) Strategic Coastal Management Plan: Incorporates adaptation strategies, including coastal protection\nand ecological restoration, to mitigate erosion and flooding.\n4.4.5. Institutional Strengthening and Intersectoral Coordination\n\nTo effectively implement climate adaptation and mitigation processes, Guinea-Bissau has significantly\nstrengthened its institutional mechanisms for climate governance and intersectoral coordination, through\nan articulated set of structural, legal and operational measures:\n\na) Creation and consolidation of the National Committee on Climate Change (CNMC)\n\nThe CNMC, coordinated by the Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC),\n\n111\n\nwas reactivated and institutionalised by ministerial order, with representation of all strategic sectors\n(energy, agriculture, water resources, fisheries, health, infrastructure, economy and finance).\n\n As has been reinforced:\no Clear definition of mandate and competences, including planning, validation and\nmonitoring of climate policies;\no Creation of Sectoral Technical Groups to support the updating of the NDC and elaboration\nof the Fourth National Communication (NC4);\no Improving horizontal coordination between ministries and vertical coordination with\nregional governments and local authorities.\n\nb) Institutional and technical strengthening of executive bodies\n\nThe capacities of the National Institute of the Environment (INA) and the Institute of Biodiversity and\nProtected Areas (IBAP), responsible for implementing and monitoring environmental and climate\npolicies, were strengthened.\n\n As has been reinforced:\no Conducting technical training in environmental assessment, adaptation, GHG inventories\nand resilience planning;\no Modernisation of infrastructure and equipment for collecting and managing\nenvironmental data;\no Integration of specialised personnel and creation of permanent thematic units on climate\nchange and biodiversity;\no Development of cooperation protocols with universities, research centres and\ninternational partners (UNDP, GEF, World Bank).\n\nc) Implementation of Climate Project Management Units\n\nProject Management Units (PMUs) were created and institutionalised within MABAC to ensure the\ncoordinated implementation of climate initiatives, such as the Coastal Project, the Rapid Alert Project\nand the Mini-Energy Networks Project.\n\n How they have been strengthened:\n\no Adoption of manuals of standardised administrative and financial procedures;\no Establishment of reporting and supervision mechanisms directly linked to the CNMC;\no Training of technical teams in project management and results monitoring;\no Harmonisation of planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&A) instruments between\ndifferent projects.\n\nd) Adoption of legal and normative instruments\n\n112\n\nThe institutional strengthening process was accompanied by the approval and updating of legal\ninstruments that consolidate the climate governance framework:\n\n Revision of the Basic Environmental Law (Law No. 10/2010);\n Preparation of the Decree of Creation and Functioning of the CNMC;\n Integration of the Climate Component in the National Sustainable Development Plan and sectoral\nplanning plans;\n Consolidation of the National Climate Finance Coordination Mechanism, in operationalisation\nphase with the support of UNDP and GCF.\n\n4.4.5. Adaptation Targets\n~\nGuinea-Bissau's national adaptation targets are clearly defined at three strategic and complementary\nlevels:\n\n1. International Commitments – Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)\nThe Nationally Determined Contribution 2021 (NDC, 2021) sets priority adaptation targets in\nkey sectors, including:\n\no Water resources: enhanced hydro-meteorological monitoring and integrated river basin\nmanagement;\no Agriculture and food security: promoting drought and salinisation resilient agricultural\npractices;\no Coastal areas: implementation of protection measures against coastal erosion and sea level\nrise;\no Biodiversity and ecosystems: conservation and restoration of mangroves, forests and\nprotected areas as natural barriers to adaptation;\no Health: strengthening epidemiological surveillance for climate-sensitive diseases.\n\n🔗 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 2021) – Guinea-Bissau;\n(https://unfccc.int/NDCREG)\n\n2. National Adaptation Plan (NAP)\n\nThe National Adaptation Plan (NAP), currently being implemented, sets operational goals for the\nmedium term (2025–2030), including:\n\no Reducing the vulnerability of coastal and agricultural communities through resilient\ninfrastructure and diversification of livelihoods;\no Integrate climate adaptation into spatial planning and local planning instruments;\no Strengthen early warning systems and institutional capacity to respond to climate\ndisasters;\no Promote technical and scientific training in adaptation and climate risk management.\n\n113\n\no\n🔗 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) – Guinea-Bissau; (https://napcentral.org/naps/guineabissau/)\n\n3. National and Sectoral Sustainable Development Plans and Strategies\n\nThese instruments translate the adaptation goals into concrete and integrated actions, articulating\nwith the Strategic and Operational Plan Terra Ranka II (2025–2030), the National Biodiversity\nStrategy and Action Plan (ENBPA), the National Coastal Management Plan and the National\nRenewable Energy Plan.\nExamples of sectoral targets include:\n\no Energy: expanding the use of renewable energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels;\no Fisheries: adoption of sustainable practices and improvement of fish conservation\ninfrastructure;\no Infrastructure: road construction and public works adapted to extreme events;\no Education and gender: promoting the inclusion of women and young people in climate\nadaptation and awareness actions.\n\n🔗 Strategic Plan \"Terra Ranka II\" (2025–2030); (https://www.planification.gw/)\n🔗 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (ENBPA);\n(https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/about/latest)\n\n4.5. Progress in implementing adaptation and Adaptation Progress Indicators\n4.5.1. Progress in the implementation of adaptation\nGuinea-Bissau has taken significant steps to consolidate adaptation to climate change as a national\npriority. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), presented in 2021, sets clear adaptation targets\nin key sectors such as water, agriculture, forestry, health and coastal areas. These commitments are in\nline with the Paris Agreement in its Article 7.\nAt the same time, the country began formulating its National Adaptation Plan (NAP), with technical and\nfinancial support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Green Climate\nFund (GCF). Activities undertaken to date include climate vulnerability assessments, cross-sectoral\nconsultation workshops and the definition of criteria to prioritise adaptive measures.\nAdaptation has also been gradually integrated into the main national and sectoral planning instruments,\nincluding the Strategic Development Plan \"Terra Ranka II\", the Agricultural and Rural Sector Master\nPlan (PDSAR) and the Integrated National Water Resources Management Plan (NIWRM).\nThe table below shows the progress of the Adaptation Policy and the Strategic Table.\nTable 4-0-2:Adaptation Policy and Strategy\n\nInstrument\n\nProgress\n\n114\n\nNDC\n(Nationally Determined Contribution)\nThe 2021 NDC integrates adaptation commitments in the areas of\nwater, agriculture, forests, coastal areas and health. Preparations for\nthe submission of the second (updated NDC) version are ongoing.\nCASSEROLE\n(National Adaptation Plan)\nIn the formulation phase, with the support of UNDP/UNEP under the\nGreen Climate Fund (GCF) preparation programme, vulnerability\ndiagnostics and sector prioritisation workshops were conducted.\nSector Adaptation Plans\nAmong them are the Master Plan of the Agricultural and Rural Sector\n(PDSAR), the National Plan for Integrated Water Resources\nManagement (PNGIRH) and the National REDD+ Strategy. These\ndocuments incorporate adaptive goals and actions.\nPolicy Integration\nDeveloper's Guide\nIntegration of adaptation into national plans (Strategic and\nOperational Plan – Terra Ranka II) is ongoing, especially in the areas\nof resilient agriculture, renewable energy and coastal management.\n\nDuring the period under review, Guinea-Bissau has implemented a number of adaptation measures in\npriority sectors such as agriculture, water, coastal areas, biodiversity, health and gender. Interventions\nwere carried out at both Community and institutional level, with the aim of reducing climate vulnerability\nand increasing the resilience of human and ecological systems.\nIn addition to the description of the actions, measurable progress has been made, with emphasis on the\nfollowing indicators:\nResilient\nAgriculture:\n+1,600 farmers trained in agroecological practices and sustainable water use; Implementation of 12 solar\nirrigation systems in arid areas of Oio, Cacheu and Gabú.\n\nWater Management:\nRehabilitation of 23 holes and construction of 10 new community water points;\n\nCoastal Protection and Ecosystems:\nRehabilitation of 981 ha of wetlands and mangroves (Coastal Project); Awareness of 54 coastal\ncommunities on climate risks and nature-based solutions.\n\nEducation and Gender:\nInclusion of climate change issues in the curriculum of 32 pilot primary schools; Support for 135\nwomen in climate cooperatives with access to microfinance for resilient activities.\n\nThese figures demonstrate not only the scope of the actions, but also the concrete positive impacts on\npeople's lives and ecosystems. One of the main lessons observed is the importance of community\nparticipation and the integration of adaptation to local and sectoral policies. The continuity and expansion\nof these actions depends, however, on the mobilisation of additional funding and the consolidation of\ninstitutional capacity.\n4.5.2. Adaptation Progress Indicators\nBelow is the table of Sector Adaptation Progress Indicators.\n\n115\n\nTable 4-0-3.

Determination procedure\n\nStep 1 – Identification of priority sectors: carried out through national and regional consultations\nconducted by the National Committee on Climate Change (CNMC).\n\nStep 2 – Definition of indicators:\no It was based on the criteria of the UNFCCC Adaptation Committee and the NAP Technical\nGuidelines (UNDP/UNEP);\no Each indicator was associated with an operational objective of the NAP and a target of NDC\n2021;\no Quantitative (number, area, percentage) and qualitative (level of training, political integration)\nindicators were used.\n\nStep 3 – Technical validation: the indicators were approved by the CNMC and integrated into the\nAdaptation Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system, currently under development.\n\n2. Measuring progress\n\nProgress is measured through half-yearly project reports and field missions, consolidated by MABAC.\n\no The baselines were determined between 2018–2020, prior to the implementation of the main\nadaptation projects (Coastal, WACA, Early Warning).\n\n116\n\nMetrics are measured according to:\n\no Agriculture: number of farmers participating in training or direct beneficiaries;\no Water resources: number of infrastructure rehabilitated or new sources of supply installed;\no Coasts and mangroves: restored hectares, validated by satellite imagery and field checks (IBAP);\no Education and gender: number of institutions with adapted curriculum and number of women\nsupported in resilience programmes.\n\n3. Reporting and integration\n\nThe results were partially reported in the Third National Communication (NC3, 2018) and updated in the\nsectoral reports submitted to the UNFCCC in 2021–2023.\n\nIn BTR2, these indicators will be consolidated in the Adaptation Monitoring Approach (AMA), in\nalignment with the Guidelines for BTR Adaptation Reporting (CMA Decision 18/CMA.1).\n\nDetailed information and calculation methodologies can be found in the following documents:\n\n🔗 NDC 2021 – Republic of Guinea-Bissau (https://unfccc.int/NDCREG);\n🔗 National Adaptation Plan (NAP) – NAP Central (https://napcentral.org/naps/guinea-bissau/);\n🔗 Third National Communication (NC3) – UNFCCC (https://unfccc.int/documents).\n\n4.5.3. Implementation of Projects and Actions on the Ground\nAt the operational level, Guinea-Bissau implements a number of projects that directly contribute to\nclimate adaptation. One of the most emblematic is the Coastal Project, which aims to protect coastal\nareas and subsistence agriculture. This project promotes actions such as the rehabilitation of protection\ndykes, reforestation of mangroves, installation of irrigation systems and formation of communities in\nclimate resilient agricultural practices.\nAnother strategic project is the Early Warning Project, which aims to strengthen national climate\ninformation and early warning systems. With funding from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the\ninstallation of new weather stations, the strengthening of the National Directorate of Meteorology, and\ntechnical training of national experts in climate modelling and forecasting are underway.\nOther initiatives include the Functional Literacy Programme focussing on climate resilience, targeting\nwomen and youth in the most vulnerable areas, and the WACA Project, with interventions focused on\nintegrated coastal zone management and erosion reduction.\nIn the energy sector, the country is betting on the promotion of solar energy as an adaptation strategy,\nguaranteeing the supply of energy in remote communities and reducing vulnerability to climate shocks.\nThe table below shows the status of the Implementation of Adaptation Projects and Concrete Actions.\n\n117\n\nTable 4-0-3: Implementation of Projects and Concrete Actions of Adaptation.\n\nProject/Programme\n\nSector\n\nActions in progress\n\nFinanciers\nCostal Project\nCoastal areas and\nagriculture\nDam rehabilitation, mangrove\nreforestation, support for resilient\nagriculture and water security\nGEF, UNDP\nQuick Alert Project\nMeteorology and\nresilience\nStrengthening of climate information\nsystems, installation of weather stations,\nearly warning training\nGreen Climate\nFund, UNDP\nFunctional Literacy\nProject\nGender and local\nresilience\nFunctional education for women and\nyouth, focussing on sustainable agriculture\nand adaptation to climate change\nCoastal\nWACA Project\nCoastal management\nStrengthening the resilience of coastal\ncommunities and protecting them from\nerosion\nWorld Bank,\nUEMOA\nSolar Programme for\nResilience\nEnergy\nPromotion of solar panels in rural areas as\nan energy resilience strategy\nUNDP, Ministry\nof Energy\n\n4.5.4. Advances in Governance, Monitoring and Evaluation\nGuinea-Bissau created and operationalised the National Committee on Climate Change (CNCM),\nresponsible for coordinating the implementation of climate policies, including adaptation actions under\nthe NDC and the future NAP. This committee is inter-ministerial and also includes representatives of\ncivil society, the private sector, universities and technical partners.\nThe Monitoring, Reporting and Verification System (MRV) for Adaptation is under development, with\nmethodological proposals for data collection, definition of indicators and institutional coordination\narrangements. This system will be essential to measure progress and report to UNFCCC international\nmechanisms.\nIn addition, efforts are being made to integrate climate data from various institutions, to improve the\ntechnical capacity of the National Environment Institute (INA) and the National Institute of Meteorology\n(INM) and to digitise the databases of historical series and projections.\nThe table below presents the governance, monitoring and evaluation structure.\n\nTable 4-0-4Subject: Governance, Monitoring and Evaluation Framework\nComponent\nCurrent Situation\nEstablishment of the NCCC (National\nCommittee on Climate Change)\nIt works with inter-ministerial representatives, NGOs, civil\nsociety and the private sector.

Monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures and processes in Guinea-Bissau\nGuinea-Bissau is currently in a process of structuring and gradually operationalising its national MRV\nsystem, focussing on both mitigation (actions to reduce GHG emissions) and adaptation (actions, impacts\nand results). This process is driven by the commitments made under the Nationally Determined\nContribution (NDC) of the National Adaptation Plan (PAN) and the preparation of the Second Biennial\nTransparency Report (RBT2).\nThe table below shows the progress made so far in the adaptation process.\nTable 4-0-5: Progress so far in the adaptation process\n\nComponent\n\nCurrent Situation\nInstitutional Structure\n✓The National Committee on Climate Change (NCCC) has been established,\nleading the coordination of MRV actions.\n✓Established a technical working group for MRV under BTR2.\nLegal and Regulatory Table\n⚠️ In development.

The traceability of climate resources is done by project,\nwithout a unified database.\n⚠️ A financial module for the MRV is being prepared in the context of BTR2.\n4.7. Prevention, Minimisation and Management of Losses and Damage Associated with Climate\nChange Impacts in Guinea-Bissau\nGuinea-Bissau, as a small island developing state and West African country with low adaptation capacity,\nis among the most vulnerable nations to the impacts of climate change. The main threats include rising\nsea levels, coastal erosion, flooding, prolonged droughts, and changes in precipitation patterns, which\nsignificantly affect agriculture, fisheries, food security, public health, and basic infrastructure.\n\n119\n\nTo prevent and minimise these impacts, the Government adopted several strategies. The updated\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC) incorporates explicit commitments related to loss and\ndamage management. Initiatives are underway, such as the Coastal Project (focused on community\nresilience and vulnerable coastal zones) and the WACA Project, which aims to protect against erosion\nand restore coastal ecosystems. These projects integrate preventive actions such as mangrove\nrehabilitation, community awareness, building resilient infrastructure and improving early warning\nsystems.\nDespite these efforts, losses and damages are already being felt in several regions. Coastal communities\nface forced displacement due to loss of land and housing; farmers suffer from unpredictable rainfall and\ncrop failure; and unique ecosystems such as the Bijagós Archipelago are threatened. The institutional\nresponse still faces structural challenges, including weak cross-sectoral coordination, insufficient data,\nlack of adequate climate finance, and lack of compensation or insurance mechanisms for loss and\ndamage.\nAgainst this background, the country recognises the urgent need to move forward with a national\nmechanism for loss and damage that integrates risk identification, quantification of impacts, and resource\nmobilisation. Strengthening technical and institutional capacities, implementing robust monitoring and\nearly warning systems and access to international funding, including the new Loss and Damage Fund\nestablished under the UNFCCC, are also priorities.\nWith a focus on vulnerable communities and nature-based solutions, Guinea-Bissau is determined to\nprotect lives, livelihoods and ecosystems by strengthening national climate resilience and contributing to\na just and sustainable transition.\n4.8. Cooperation, good practices, experience and lessons learned on climate resilience in GuineaBissau\n4.8.1. Cooperation\nGuinea-Bissau has strengthened its response to climate change through strategic partnerships,\nimplementation of good practices and continuous learning from local and international experiences.\nCooperation with multilateral organisations, partner countries, and local communities has been essential\nto drive adaptation and mitigation actions.\nThe following table presents the list of National and International Cooperation\nTable 4-0-6:List of National and International Cooperation\n\nType of Cooperation\n\nInstitutions/Partners\n\nMain contributions\nMultilateral Cooperation\nUNDP, FAO, GEF, GCF,\nWorld Bank\nTechnical and financial support for\nadaptation,\nresilience\nand\nstrategic\nplanning projects\nRegional Technical Cooperation\nOMM, CILSS/AGRHYMET\nWeather data, early warning systems,\ntechnical training\nBilateral Cooperation\nEU, German Cooperation\nFinancing of water infrastructure and\ninstitutional support\nConservation Partnerships\nMCRP, IUCN\nCoastal\nprotection,\necosystem-based\nmanagement\nRegional Mechanisms\nECOWAS, WACA, CPLP\nIntegration into regional climate response\nnetworks and sharing of best practices\n\n120\n\nGuinea-Bissau has accumulated relevant and promising experiences in climate adaptation, especially\nthrough pilot projects implemented in vulnerable areas with strong community participation. These good\npractices demonstrate local solutions with a tangible impact on improving the resilience of livelihoods,\ninfrastructure and ecosystems, and can serve as a model for national and regional scale expansion and\nreplication.\nThe following table presents the Best Practices Implemented.\nTable 4-0-7: Best Practices Implemented\n\nIntersection Domain\n\nGood Practices\nAgriculture and Food Security\nIntroduction of resistant crops, agroecological practices, consortia and\nagroforestry systems\nWater resources\nTanks, small reservoirs, National Plan for Integrated Water Resources\nManagement\nCoastal areas\nReforestation of mangroves, construction of adapted ramps, management\nof community resources\nEducation and Awareness\nClimate-focused functional literacy for women and youth in vulnerable\nareas\nMonitoring and Prevention\nStrengthening the early warning system, environmental databases, SGIs\nin the INA and IBAP\n\n4.8.2. Experiences and lessons learned\nDuring the implementation process of climate actions in Guinea-Bissau, especially in the field of\nadaptation, several relevant experiences were accumulated. These experiences have generated practical\nlessons that may be useful for other developing countries, in particular small island states and West\nAfrican countries with similar socioeconomic and ecological characteristics.\n1. Integrating Adaptation into Local and Sectoral Policies\nLesson learned: Adaptation is most effective when integrated with local and sectoral planning tools.\nExperience has shown that the adaptation pilot projects with the greatest impact were those linked to\nLocal Development Plans (LDPs) and Protected Area Management Plans. This increased local\nacceptance, facilitated the mobilisation of resources and reinforced sustainability after the completion of\nprojects.\n2. Community participation from the diagnostic phase\nLesson learned: Involving communities in the design and monitoring of adaptation actions significantly\nimproves their effectiveness and acceptance.\nDuring the Coastal Project, coastal communities were involved in identifying climate risks and naturebased solutions. This increased the relevance of interventions and reduced resistance. It also facilitated\nthe appropriation and maintenance of results, such as mangrove plantations and drainage infrastructure.\n3. The importance of developing technical and institutional capacities\nLesson learned: Investing in the continuous training of national technicians and community actors is\nessential to ensure the continuity and replicability of adaptation actions.\n\n121\n\nIt was found that local technicians trained during the projects (e.g. water management, resilient\nagricultural practices, use of climate tools) became multipliers in their regions. However, in some cases,\nthe high turnover in the public sector has compromised knowledge retention.\n4. Monitoring and Evaluation: Gaps and Opportunities\nLesson learned: the absence of robust systems to monitor the impacts of adaptation actions makes it\ndifficult to assess progress and mobilise climate finance.\nDespite the implementation of several actions, such as mangrove rehabilitation or the promotion of\nresilient agriculture, the lack of harmonised impact indicators and real-time data has compromised the\nability to report results to technical and financial partners.\n5.Fragmented and short-term financing\nLesson learned: The fragmentation of financial resources and the short duration of projects limit\nsustainable impacts.\nMany adaptation projects in Guinea-Bissau operate with short funding (2 to 3 years), making it difficult\nto consolidate results. The dispersion of funding sources and the complexity of communication\nrequirements also overwhelm local capacities.\n4.9. Any other information related to climate change impacts and adaptation under Article 7 of\nthe Paris Agreement.\nArticle 7 of the Paris Agreement recognises adaptation as a global challenge with local, sub-national,\nnational and international dimensions, and is essential for the protection of populations, livelihoods and\necosystems. Guinea-Bissau, as a highly vulnerable country with low capacity for adaptation, has sought\nto develop consistent actions to integrate adaptation into the core of its national development planning.\nGuinea-Bissau recognises that adaptation is a national priority and requires a strategic, participatory and\ncoordinated approach.\nThe following table provides information related to the adaptation under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement\nin Guinea-Bissau.\nTable 4-0-8:Information on adaptation under Article 7 of the Paris Agreement in Guinea-Bissau\n\nCategory\n\nDetailed description\nObserved impacts\n- Increase in frequency and intensity of seasonal floods (e.g. floods in Bafatá, Gabu\nand Bissau in 2022-2024)\n- Increased salinisation of coastal soils and mangrove degradation\n- Reduction of agricultural productivity - Decreased access to drinking water in\nrural areas\nVulnerable Sectors\n- Agriculture and food security\n- Water resources - Coastal infrastructure - Public health - Biodiversity and fragile\necosystems (mangroves, estuaries, wetlands)\nLimited adaptive capabilities\n- Poor institutional and technical capacity to respond\n- Low availability of hydro-meteorological data - Insufficient financial resources -\nPoor integration of adaptation into sectoral and local policies\nNational Adaptation Priorities\n1.

Introduction\nIn accordance with Decision 17/CP.8 adopted at the Eighth Conference of the Parties (COP8), Parties to\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are encouraged to include in\ntheir National Communications additional information deemed relevant to the achievement of the\nobjectives of the Convention. This provision aims to enable countries to share, in addition to mandatory\nreporting, experiences, initiatives, policies and innovative measures that can contribute to enhancing\ntransparency, cooperation and the effectiveness of climate action at the global level.\nDecision 17/CP. 8 also recognises the diversity of national contexts and highlights the added value of\nadditional information, in particular as regards environmental governance, gender mainstreaming,\neducation, public awareness, technology transfer and the involvement of non-state actors.\nAt the national level, Guinea-Bissau, as a developing country particularly vulnerable to the impacts of\nclimate change, has made significant efforts to align its policies, strategies and initiatives with the\nobjectives of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The country continues to strengthen its institutional\nand technical capacities, prioritising resilience, adaptation and sustainable development.\nIn this context, Guinea-Bissau has developed and implemented several projects and programmes related\nto biodiversity conservation, coastal protection, promotion of renewable energies and sustainable\nmanagement of natural resources. Social inclusion, women's empowerment, youth mobilisation and\ncommunity awareness are also key aspects for strengthening the national response to climate change.\n\n123\n\nThus, this chapter of the Fourth National Communication of Guinea-Bissau presents a set of\ncomplementary information that contributes to a better understanding of the national efforts, the\nchallenges faced and the future perspectives for action under the Convention.\n\nFrom this introduction, this chapter contains the following subchapters:\n\n Development, transfer and access to environmentally sound technologies and knowledge\n Capacity building and regional/international cooperation\n Education, awareness raising and public participation\n Cooperation with non-governmental organisations, the private sector and civil society\n Systematic research and observation\n Gender equality and female empowerment\n Synergies with other environmental conventions\n Other relevant initiatives and information\n\n5.2. Development, Transfer and Access to Environmentally Sound Technologies and Knowledge\nThe transfer and development of environmentally friendly technologies (ETs) are key elements to support\ndeveloping countries in the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC). Decision 17/CP.8 emphasises that the identification of technological needs, the\ncreation of favourable conditions and the promotion of international cooperation mechanisms are\nessential measures to accelerate the adoption of technologies that contribute to climate change mitigation\nand adaptation.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, a country characterised by high climate vulnerability and significant structural\nlimitations, technology transfer represents a strategic opportunity to strengthen community resilience,\nimprove basic services and support sustainable development. The country has made increasing efforts to\nmobilise partnerships, integrate appropriate technologies and promote local capacity development,\nalthough significant technical, financial and institutional barriers still exist.\n5.2.1. National Situation and Priority Areas\nThe national priorities for technology transfer fall within the following sectors:\na) Energy\n\nThe national energy matrix depends largely on diesel generators and traditional biomass (firewood and\ncharcoal). Progress has been made in recent years with the introduction of hybrid solar mini-grids,\ndecentralised photovoltaic systems and residential solar kits, especially in rural communities with no\nconnection to the national power grid.\n\nProjects supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), UNDP and bilateral cooperation have\nenabled pilot infrastructure to be set up in several regions (e.g. Bafatá, Gabú and Oio), demonstrating the\npotential of renewable energy to reduce emissions and improve access to clean energy.\n\n124\n\nThe challenge now is to scale up these solutions, ensure system maintenance, and create sustainable\nfinancial models that engage the private sector and local communities.\n\nb) Agriculture and food security\n\nThe subsistence and highly rain-dependent agricultural sector faces increasing risks due to droughts,\nclimate variability and soil degradation.\n\nConservation agriculture technologies, agroforestry systems, solar-powered drip irrigation, and more\nclimate-resilient crop varieties are being progressively introduced. The country also benefits from lowimpact traditional practices, which can be combined with modern technologies to increase productivity\nwithout compromising ecosystems.\n\nHowever, the dissemination of these techniques is still limited by the lack of technical assistance,\naccessible equipment and adequate agricultural extension mechanisms.\n\nc) Coastal and wetland management\n\nCoastal areas, which account for more than 50% of the national territory, are increasingly exposed to\nerosion, salt intrusion and flooding.\n\nTo address these risks, hydro-meteorological monitoring technologies (automatic stations, remote\nsensors), early warning systems and digital mapping using drones and Geographic Information Systems\n(GIS) were introduced.\n\nProjects such as WACA (West Africa Coastal Areas) supported the introduction of these tools, allowing\nbetter planning and faster response to extreme events.\n\nDespite this, coverage is still limited and there is an urgent need to train national technicians to operate\nand maintain these technologies.\n\nd) Water resources\n\nThe water resources sector represents a priority area for technology transfer and adoption in GuineaBissau, given its cross-cutting importance for public health, food security, energy and the resilience of\ncommunities to climate change. Water availability and quality are crucial factors for public health,\nagriculture and the resilience of communities.\nAmong the initiatives already implemented, the following stand out:\n- Stormwater collection and storage systems, designed to reduce dependence on surface and groundwater\nsources, ensuring reserves during the dry season.\n- Holes equipped with solar pumps, which allow the extraction of groundwater in a sustainable way,\nreducing operational costs and emissions associated with the use of fossil fuels.\n\n125\n\n- Low-cost filtration technologies, promoted mainly in rural communities, to ensure access to drinking\nwater and reduce the risk of waterborne diseases.\nThe Directorate-General for Water Resources, in cooperation with international partners, has promoted\nthe modernisation of the hydrological observation network, although financial and technical challenges\nremain.\n\ne) Solid waste and urban management\n\nThe solid waste and urban management sector represents one of the biggest environmental and public\nhealth challenges in Guinea-Bissau, due to population growth, rapid urbanisation and the lack of\nstructured waste collection, sorting and treatment systems. Inadequate waste management results in open\ndumps, proliferation of disease vectors, contamination of soil and waterways, and emissions of\ngreenhouse gases (mainly methane from organic decomposition).\nDespite the challenges, pilot experiments and initiatives with high potential are starting to emerge:\n- Waste recovery: experimental projects aimed at sorting and reusing recyclable materials (plastics,\nmetals, glass), still on a small scale.\nCommunity composting: initial deployment of composting plants, using organic urban and agricultural\nwaste to produce natural fertilisers.\n- Biogas production: pilot projects in institutions (schools, hospitals and community centres) to\ntransform organic waste into renewable energy, contributing to the replacement of firewood and charcoal.\nThese initiatives are still at an early stage, but represent areas of great potential for emission mitigation\nand clean energy generation.\n\nRecent advances\nIn recent years, Guinea-Bissau has made significant progress in mobilising resources and implementing\ninitiatives that promote the introduction of sustainable and adapted environmental technologies to the national\ncontext. These advances reflect not only enhanced international cooperation, but also the country’s commitment\nto promoting innovative solutions to address the challenges of climate change, natural-resource management,\nand sustainable development.\n- Establishment of strategic partnerships\nGuinea-Bissau has sought to consolidate strategic partnerships with international reference organisations,\nincluding the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), the World Bank, the European Union and the West African Economic and Monetary Union\n(WAEMU/WAEMU). These partnerships have played a central role in advancing climate action in the\ncountry, enabling not only the financing of climate change adaptation and mitigation projects, but also\nthe introduction of locally appropriate technologies such as renewable energy systems, resilient\nagricultural practices, and environmental monitoring equipment.\n\n126\n\nIn addition, these partnerships have contributed to institution building, promoting technical assistance\nand the sharing of international best practices, which are essential to increase national capacity for\nplanning, implementing and monitoring environmental policies and projects. Thus, international\ncooperation has proved to be a strategic tool for building sustainable and resilient development, aligned\nwith global climate goals.\n- Modernisation of climate and hydrological observation\nGuinea-Bissau is significantly strengthening its climate and hydrological monitoring capacity by\nforecasting and installing automatic hydro-meteorological stations as part of the Early Warning Project.\nThese stations will enable real-time data collection on climate variability, precipitation, and water resources,\nproviding a solid basis for informed decisions.\nWith the deployment of this equipment, the country will be able to improve its national early warning\nsystems against floods and droughts, strengthening its capacity to respond to extreme events. Moreover,\nthe use of reliable scientific data will support more effective policies and interventions, promoting\nevidence-based environmental management. At the same time, this modernisation will facilitate the\nintegration of Guinea-Bissau into West Africa’s regional climate monitoring networks, fostering\ncooperation, information exchange and alignment with international best practices.\n- Expansion of renewable energies\nGuinea-Bissau has promoted the implementation and expansion of community solar mini-grids in rural\nareas, providing sustainable access to electricity in areas not yet covered by the national power grid. This\ninitiative has generated significant positive impacts: it contributes to reducing energy poverty, benefiting\nfamilies and small businesses; improves quality of life by electrifying schools, health centres, and\ncommunity spaces; and reduces pressure on forest ecosystems by partially replacing the use of firewood\nand charcoal as energy sources.\nThe expansion of renewable energy thus represents a strategic step towards more sustainable, resilient\nand environmentally balanced rural development, while promoting social inclusion, energy efficiency\nand conservation of natural resources.\n- Training of national technicians\nGuinea-Bissau has consistently strengthened its technical capabilities through training programmes and\nknowledge transfer in strategic areas for sustainable development. These efforts aim to train professionals\nto operate renewable energy systems efficiently, ensuring the maintenance and sustainability of the\ninstalled solar infrastructure in several regions of the country.\nAt the same time, the programmes promote and climate-smart sustainable agricultural practices,\nincluding soil conservation techniques, efficient water use and productive diversification, contributing to\nincreasing the resilience of the agricultural sector to climate change. In coastal management, technical\ntraining allows a more effective response to erosion, sea level rise and degradation of coastal ecosystems,\nenhancing environmental protection and the resilience of coastal communities.\n\n127\n\nThus, human resources training becomes an essential pillar for the sustainable development of GuineaBissau, promoting knowledge, innovation and evidence-based practices to address the country's\nenvironmental and climate challenges.\n5.2.2. Identified Challenges\nDespite significant progress in implementing sustainable development and climate change adaptation\nprojects, Guinea-Bissau faces a number of challenges that limit the full effectiveness of these initiatives.\nThe main one is the still limited technical capacity for the operation and maintenance of modern\nequipment, which limits the ideal use of the technologies introduced.\nHigh technology acquisition and import costs, often compounded by customs barriers and logistical\nchallenges, are another significant obstacle. Excessive dependence on external donors is also\nproblematic, putting at risk the financial sustainability of essential projects for the country.\nMoreover, there is weak institutional coordination and the absence of an integrated national strategy for\ntechnology transfer, factors that hinder coordination between different sectors and stakeholders. Finally,\nprivate sector involvement remains weak, despite its potential central role in spreading innovative\nsolutions and promoting local investments in sustainable technologies.\nThese challenges highlight the need to strengthen national capacities, promote integrated policies and\nfoster strategic partnerships that ensure the continuity and lasting impact of climate action and sustainable\ndevelopment in the country.\n5.2.3. Future perspectives and priority measures\n\nThe Government of Guinea-Bissau recognises that the country's sustainable progress and climate\nresilience depend on strategic and coordinated actions. Therefore, it considers as a priority the\ndevelopment of a National Technology Transfer Strategy, aligned with Nationally Determined\nContributions (NDCs) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to guide the introduction and\ndissemination of technological solutions appropriate to the national context.\nTo ensure the financial viability of these initiatives, the government aims to create accessible climate\nfinance mechanisms that encourage both the private sector and communities to invest in sustainable\ntechnologies. At the same time, cooperation will be strengthened through regional and international\npartnerships, leveraging networks such as ECOWAS and the African Union, promoting the exchange of\nexperiences and access to technologies tailored to local needs.\nStrengthening national capacities is also a priority, through continuing training programmes and the\ncreation of technology demonstration centres to serve as practical reference points for technicians,\nmanagers and communities. Finally, the government is committed to local innovation, encouraging\nuniversities, research centres, and small businesses to develop solutions that meet the country’s\nsocioeconomic and environmental conditions, contributing to resilient, inclusive, and sustainable\ndevelopment.\n5.3. Capacity Building and Regional/International Cooperation\n\n128\n\nCapacity building is a key pillar for the effective implementation of the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Guinea-Bissau, given the limited institutional and\ntechnical capacity at the national level. The country recognises that progress in climate change\nmitigation, adaptation, monitoring and reporting strongly depends on human resource training,\ninstitutional consolidation, and regional and international cooperation.\n5.3.1. Strengthening National Capabilities\nIn recent years, Guinea-Bissau has promoted a set of initiatives aimed at strengthening the technical and\ninstitutional capacity of government entities, civil society and academia. Initiatives include training\nnational technicians in strategic areas, including greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories, measurement,\nreporting and verification (MRV) systems, ecosystem-based adaptation, and climate planning.\nSpecialised training in climate modelling, the use of remote sensing tools, environmental database\nmanagement and national reporting was also offered under the United Nations Framework Convention\non Climate Change (UNFCCC), ensuring the production of accurate and consistent technical\ninformation.\nGender mainstreaming in training programmes has ensured greater participation of women in technical\nareas and decision-making on climate change, promoting inclusion and equity. At the same time, the\ncreation of sectoral technical focal points has facilitated the collection and harmonisation of data,\nenhancing the production of national transparency reports, such as National Communications (NC),\nBiennial Update Reports (BAR) and Biennial Transparency Reports (BTR).\nThese actions have contributed significantly to strengthening the country’s institutions, increasing its\ncapacity for evidence-based climate policy planning, monitoring, and implementation and international\nbest practices.\nDespite progress in capacity-building and institution-building, Guinea-Bissau continues to face\nsignificant gaps that limit the consolidation and sustainability of progress. Among the main challenges\nare the high turnover of qualified personnel, which compromises the continuity and retention of\naccumulated technical knowledge; the weak institutionalisation of acquired knowledge, which makes it\ndifficult to systematise and apply the skills developed in practice; and the absence of national training\ncentres specialised in climate change, which restricts access to continuing education and technical\ndevelopment of professionals in the sector.\nThese gaps highlight the need for more robust strategies to ensure the maintenance and expansion of\nnational capabilities, ensuring that technical knowledge and best practices are fully incorporated into the\ncountry’s institutions and projects.\n5.3.2. Regional cooperation\nGuinea-Bissau is progressively strengthening its integration into regional cooperation mechanisms,\nrecognising the importance of sharing experiences, good practices and technical expertise to address\nclimate and environmental challenges. Active participation in the Economic Community of West African\nStates (ECOWAS) has enabled the country to participate in regional adaptation and mitigation\nprogrammes, including initiatives focused on promoting renewable energy and climate-resilient food\nsecurity.\n\n129\n\nWithin the framework of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Guinea-Bissau\ncollaborates in projects for the sustainable management of natural resources and harmonisation of\nenvironmental policies, contributing to a more integrated and coherent approach to environmental\nmanagement in the region.\nParticipation in the West African Mangrove Commission (WACC) provided an exchange of experience\nand knowledge on integrated coastal management, mangrove restoration and the protection of marine\nbiodiversity, enhancing the resilience of the country's coastal ecosystems.\nIn addition, cooperation with regional university and research networks has fostered strategic\npartnerships with universities in the sub-region, enabling joint studies on biodiversity, climate variability\nand community resilience, as well as contributing to the training of specialised technical personnel and\nthe production of scientific knowledge relevant to national policies and projects.\n5.3.3. International Cooperation\nGuinea-Bissau benefits from significant international cooperation, covering the technical, scientific and\nfinancial spheres, which has been essential for the advancement of the country's climate and\nenvironmental policies and projects. Active participation in multilateral environmental conventions, such\nas the UNFCCC, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the United Nations Convention to\nCombat Desertification (UNCCD), provides a strong institutional framework and ensures access to\nclimate finance mechanisms.\nThe support of UN organisations, including UNDP, FAO, UNEP, UNESCO and WHO, has been crucial\nin implementing projects involving agricultural adaptation, environmental monitoring, institutional\nstrengthening, and gender mainstreaming in climate policies, promoting more inclusive and sustainable\nsolutions.\nInternational financial institutions, such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, the\nAfrican Development Bank, and the Green Climate Fund, contribute significantly to financing strategic\nprojects in the areas of clean energy, coastal adaptation, and sustainable management of natural\nresources, strengthening the country’s capacity to implement long-term actions.\nAt the same time, cooperation with NGOs and international research centres has facilitated the transfer\nof environmentally friendly technologies, promoted applied studies and supported the training of local\nactors, allowing the incorporation of international best practices and innovative solutions adapted to the\nnational context.\n5.3.4. Future prospects and needs\nIn order to consolidate the progress achieved and to respond effectively to emerging challenges, GuineaBissau has set out a number of strategic priorities. Among them is the creation of a national centre of\nexcellence on climate change, in close collaboration with regional and international institutions, with the\nobjective of strengthening research, training and technological innovation in the country.\nStrengthening the national MRV and Transparency system is another priority, ensuring higher quality,\nconsistency and regularity in the production of climate data and reports, which are essential for evidencebased decision-making and compliance with international obligations.\n\n130\n\nMobilising international climate finance, in particular from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the\nGlobal Environment Facility (GEF), is essential to sustain strategic environmental adaptation, mitigation,\nand resilience projects. At the same time, Guinea-Bissau is committed to promoting South-South\ncooperation by facilitating the exchange of experiences with other African countries facing similar\nrealities and strengthening local capacities and best practices.\nFinally, it is considered vital to integrate the gender and youth dimensions in all capacity building and\ncooperation initiatives, recognising the essential role of these groups in climate action and sustainable\ndevelopment in the country. These priorities reflect Guinea-Bissau's commitment to consolidate an\ninclusive, scientific and sustainable approach to addressing the environmental and climate challenges of\nthe present and the future.\n5.4. Education, Awareness-Raising and Public Participation\nEducation, awareness-raising and public participation are key pillars for the effective implementation of\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Decision 17/CP.8 reinforces\nthat public awareness and the inclusion of different social groups in decision-making processes are\nessential conditions to promote a collective and sustainable response to climate change.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the integration of environmental and climate issues in formal and informal education\nhas been gaining relevance, although with structural limitations. Promoting climate literacy, community\nawareness and the involvement of civil society are considered key factors to increase community\nresilience and foster active citizenship in environmental protection.\n5.4.1. Formal education\nIn Guinea-Bissau, formal education has taken the first steps to incorporate environmental and climate\nissues into the curriculum, although significant challenges remain. The Ministry of Education, Higher\nEducation, Youth, Culture and Sport has sought to integrate content on climate change and the\nenvironment, particularly in primary and secondary education, recognising early on the importance of\nraising awareness among younger generations of the country's and the world's environmental challenges.\nIn higher education, the Amílcar Cabral University (UAC), together with other institutions, offers courses\nin biology, geography, environmental management and social sciences, covering topics such as climate\nchange, biodiversity and sustainability. These initiatives contribute to the training of professionals with\ndeep knowledge in environmental issues and to the production of relevant scientific knowledge.\nHowever, there is still no integrated national curriculum on climate education. The environmental content\nis presented in a fragmented way, with a lack of adequate didactic materials, which limits the consistency\nand depth of learning. This challenge is aggravated by the scarcity of teachers with specific training in\nenvironmental areas, which makes it difficult to disseminate specialised knowledge and consolidate a solid and\ncomprehensive environmental education.\nThe actual scenario thus shows initial progress and good policy intentions, but highlights the need for a\nmore structured and systematic approach that can ensure that all pupils acquire sound skills in climate\nchange, biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.\n\n131\n\n5.4.2. Non-formal education and Community awareness\nNon-formal education and community outreach initiatives have been crucial to complement formal\nenvironmental education and strengthen community resilience to climate change. Civil society\norganisations, both national and international, have played a central role in this process, acting mainly in\nrural and coastal areas, where the effects of climate change are felt more intensely and populations are\nmore vulnerable.\nSeveral awareness campaigns have been implemented, addressing issues such as mangrove reforestation,\nsustainable use of fisheries resources, solid waste management and energy conservation. These initiatives\naim not only to inform but also to involve communities in adopting more sustainable practices and\npreserving local ecosystems.\nStrategic projects, such as WACA (West Africa Coastal Areas) and Coastal Project, have promoted\ncommunity environmental education initiatives based on participatory methodologies that combine\nscientific knowledge with traditional wisdom, recognising the value of local experiences in developing\nadaptive solutions.\nIn addition, community radio and social media play a significant role in disseminating information on\nclimate risks and good adaptation and mitigation practices. These channels broaden the reach of the\nmessages, contributing to a greater public awareness and strengthening a culture of sustainability\nthroughout the country.\nThese actions demonstrate an integrated approach combining education, community participation and\nmedia to promote environmental awareness and resilience to climate change.\n5.4.3. Public Participation\nPublic participation in decision-making processes on environmental and climate issues has grown,\nalthough it is still at an early stage. In recent years, government authorities and institutions have made\nefforts to involve citizens by organising community forums and meetings to share information, listen to\nlocal concerns, and discuss environmental management measures.\nThe Institute of Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP), together with other government entities,\npromotes the participation of local communities in the management of protected areas through comanagement committees. These initiatives strengthen participatory governance and encourage the direct\ninvolvement of local communities in the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural\nresources.\nWomen and young people have played an increasingly important role in community mobilisation and\nlocal projects. However, they continue to face structural barriers, such as limited access to financial\nresources, technical training and decision-making spaces, which restrict their full involvement in\nenvironmental governance processes.\nIn addition, public consultations on major development projects and environmental impact assessments\nare becoming more frequent, reflecting a positive trend towards greater transparency. Despite this, there\nare still significant gaps, in particular the lack of regular and systematic mechanisms to ensure the\ncontinuous participation of citizens and effective monitoring of decisions.\n\n132\n\nIn short, while progress has been made in including the public in decision-making processes, structures\nand practices that promote broader, continuous and effective participation of citizens, especially among\nhistorically marginalised groups, need to be consolidated.\n5.4.4. Future perspectives and priority measures\nIn order to strengthen education, awareness-raising and public participation in the response to climate\nchange, Guinea-Bissau considers as a priority:\n1."

It should also encourage and promote research organizations and\ninstitutions at the national level.\n\nThe Development of Renewable Energies is a major entry for vulnerable countries to climate\nchange. Rationally valued, biomass and other renewable energy resources can be an\nimportant lever in the fight against poverty, particularly in rural areas, thus contributing to\nthe improvement of quality of life and sustainable development.\nCountries vulnerable to climate change like Guinea-Bissau should, with the support of the\ninternational community, continue researching solutions to limit the risks of increasing\ndeforestation. This will include:\n•\nAdoption of policies favouring a massive use of renewable energies;\n•\nPromoting a real transfer of technology in favour of vulnerable countries for the\ndevelopment and access to renewable energies;\n•\nRational exploitation of forests and the promotion of restocking;\n•\nContinuation and reinforcement of firewood reduction programs;\n•\nImprovement of carbonization yield;\n•\nLarge-scale valorisation of agro-industrial waste for the production of coal, thus\nallowing large-scale replacement of coal from firewood;\n•\nIncrease in the use of other sources of renewable energy, namely solar, wind,\nbiogas, micro hydroelectric power station, etc., whose considerable potential but\nlittle valued.\n\nIn the renewable energy sector, technology transfer is being carried out with installation\nthroughout the country of photo voltaic (Solar photovoltaic power plant of 314kW to\nproduce electricity in Banbadinga Sector (Banbandinga castaclaro)) and thermal solar systems\nfor lighting and heating though not in an organised fashion.\n\nGuinea-Bissau is very vulnerable to climate change and is considered one of the country exposed\nto climate change if there is an increase in mean sea level. After Bangladesh, Guinea-Bissau is the\nsecond country exposed to climate change vulnerability. The country does not yet have the\npotential to transfer technology in the forest, biodiversity and natural ecosystems sectors. Within\nthe scope of technology transfer potential for adaptation and types of technology by forest\nsector, there is currently a lack of modern technologies or industries for the transformation of\nNTFPs, agricultural, agropastoral, fishing, etc. Most rural populations in Guinea-Bissau use\nfirewood and coal as a source of energy at the national level, which means that the anthropic\naction has increased significantly in the forests. To reduce the impact on forests certain NGOs\nhave introduced the technique of using improved kilns that reduce people's physical effort and\neven the number of trees cut to produce charcoal and firewood. However, it is important to\npromote restocking in some degraded areas for the production of charcoal, which will greatly\ncontribute to minimizing the cuts of native species threatened by the production of coal.\n\n145 | Chapter 8: Other information relevant to the achievement of the Convention\n\nAlthough the emergence of certain NGO’s began in 1980 in the area of environment conservation\nand in the implementation of certain activities of sustainable development, in order to tackle the\nfight against poverty, even with the emergence of the Institute of Biodiversity and Areas\nProtected Areas (IBAP) as of 2005, there is still no improvement in the transfer of new\ntechnologies. None of these institutions has technologies to adapt to climate change. GuineaBissau has countless difficulties in acquiring new technologies for economic valuation of forest\nresources in order to contribute to food security, valorization and transformation of forest\nproducts and by-products and biodiversity in general.\n\nWhile there is a need for improved technology transfer, its implementation requires an\nenabling policy framework and the strengthening of the institutional capacity for private\nsector and market led dissemination. Specifically, this can be enhanced through the\nfinalisation of climate change policy and enactment of supportive legislation as well as the\nestablishment of dialogues and increased dissemination of research findings, innovations and\ntechnologies within the country\n\n146 | ANNEX 1.

This State Secretary\nhas a General Directorate for Environment (DGA) which serves as its executive service.\n\nOne of the main objectives of consecutive ministries in charge of the DGA, (as well as the one\nthat is currently in charge), is the application of the provisions of the UN Framework Convention\non Climate Change at the national level. It is also the one that prepared the First National\nCommunication (INC). Thanks to the support of the GBS/97/G32/PNUD/GEF Project, on\n\"Climate Change\" funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the National Program of\nAction for Adaptation to Climate Change (NAPA), which aims to help reduce the adverse effects\nof climate change on vulnerable populations, from the perspective of sustainable development\nand the fight against poverty, the National Self Assessment Project for Capacity Reinforcement,\nto manage the global environment, (ANCR), which aims to assess the needs for capacity\nbuilding and to propose a strategy and action plan for implementing the capacity building\nactivities in the Convention for Fighting Desertification, Biological Diversity and Climate Change.\n\nThe present document conforms to the commitments assumed by the Government of GuineaBissau, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to prepare,\ndiscuss and approve a strategic document entitled \"Second National Communication.\" Its\ncontent is defined by the provisions of Decision 17/CP.8, concerning the preparation of National\nCommunications of Developing Countries - (non Annex I countries) subscribers of the\nConvention.\n\nChapter I of the document deals with the presentation of national circumstances, with specific\nemphasis on aspects of development policies, linked to the main components of the process of\nclimate change. Consecutively, Chapter II establishes the national inventory of GHG emissions,\naccording to the methodology recommended by the Convention Secretariat and the IPCC.\nChapter III deals with measures to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Chapter IV refers to the\nstudy of variation and vulnerability to climate change. The fifth chapter deals with measures to\nadapt to climate change, highlighting the importance of the contribution of foreign aid. In\nChapter VI, a Socio-economic analysis of the impact of climate change is presented. The needs\nto strengthen national capacities by training, communication, awareness and information on\nclimate change in Guinea-Bissau were addressed in Chapter VII. Other relevant information is\npresented in Chapter VIII.

Its geographical coordinates are situated in between\nCabo Roxo (latitude 12 º 20 'North), the Pontat Cadete (latitude 10 º 59' north) and longitudes 13\nº 38 'and 16 º 43' W. The maximum extent in latitude is 193 km, and in longitude, 330 km. The\ncountry is divided into two zones: a continental zone and insular zone, the latter consisting of\nthe contiguous string of the islands of Jeta, Pecixe, Areias, Caiar, and Melo and the Bijagos\nArchipelago with 88 islands and islets, of only which 21 are inhabited. Administratively, the\ncountry is divided into eight Regions: Bafatá Biombo, Bolama Cacheu, Gabu, Oio, Quinara and\nTombali. Each Region is divided into Sectors and the Capital, Bissau, integrates an Autonomous\nSector of the same name, with the prerogatives of a Region. The Republic of Guinea-Bissau is\nheavily marked by the presence of estuaries, mangrove areas and large areas of shallow depth and\nvery tolerable temperatures. Figure 1 presents the map of Guinea-Bissau.\n\nFigure 1: Map of Guinea-Bissau. Source: Cell SIG.\n\n15\n\nI. 1.2 - CLIMATE\n\nThe Guinea-Bissau Climatologic Profile Report (Dias, Francisco et a l., 2007), states that the\nterritory of Guinea-Bissau is inserted in the Inter-Tropical Front (ITF) field of action ,\ncharacterized by the existence of a terrestrial mass, north of 5 ° N on the West African bulge -\nand an insular part in the Atlantic Ocean, with weather that is mainly conditioned by the situation\nof the territory in relation to the ITF and by the subsidiary actions of semi- permanent cells of\nhigh pressure, usually known as Azores Anticyclone, in the North Atlantic, and the Anticyclone of\nSanta Helena in the South Atlantic, and also the low summer heat that settles over the Sahara.\nAccording to this report:\n\nITF performs shifts to the North and South, tracking the country twice a year in\nperiods of about six months. In May, it stands as a rule that in the Northern\nterritory, the rainy season begins from June to October and ends in late October\nor early November as the passage to the South occurs. The dry season is from\nDecember to April. The months of May and November are transitional months.\nGiven that Guinea-Bissau is crossed by the inter-tropical zone convergence, it\nsuffers the influence of monsoon (hot and humid air from the Atlantic Ocean)\nduring the rainy season and the harmattan (dry, hot air that comes from the\nSahara) during the dry season. (Dias, Francisco et al. 2007)\n\nThe country is divided into two distinct climatic regions: the tropical humid sub-Guinean,\ncoincident with the coastal zone and the tropical Sudanese Region that influences the eastern\nhalf of the country. The tropical humid region is characterized by heavy rainfall (between 1,500\nand 2,500 mm / year), average temperature ranges and strong air humidity throughout the year,\nand the tropical Sudanese Region is characterized by high temperature ranges, high humidity of\nthe air in the rainy season and mild in the dry season (1st CNSMC, 2004). The climatic profile\nstudy, completed in December 2007 (Francis Dias et al, 2007), divides the country into three\nrainfall zones: the Southern zone (Tombali, Quinara and Bolama-Bijagos), with an annual\naverage of more than 2,000 mm, the Northwest area (Bissau, Biombo, Cacheu and Oio), with an\nannual average between 1,400 and 1,800 mm and the Eastern Zone (Bafata and Gabu), whose\naverage annual precipitation ranges from 1,300 mm to 1.500 mm. The maximum rainfall is\nreached in August, with the monthly average of more than 300 mm. The minimum, close to 0,\noccurs from December to April (Dry Season). However, the figure below shows that the country,\nin general, has suffered fluctuations in rainfall between the periods 1961-1990 and 1971-2000,\nwith decreasing trend towards the South, i.e., there was a decrease in rainfall during 1971-2000,\ncompared to 1961-1990, (Study of Climate Profile, December 2007).

Coastal zones, North and South, are mostly lowlands.\nThus with the high tidal ranges that occur here, reaching 6 meters, large areas of coastal areas\nare exposed to its effects. This area represents an area of about 22,235 km ² (61% of the\ncountry) and has a dual importance: environmental and socio-economic. Its ecological\nimportance is justified by the fact that it encompasses diverse ecosystems rich in terms of\nbiodiversity resources such as forest, mangrove, freshwater, intertidal and marine ecosystems.\nThe rare and endemic species, as well as the ones that migrate from Europe, Asia, and from the\nSub-Region choose this area for shelter, feeding and reproduction. Its economic potential and\nsocial importance derives from that ecological richness, given that the exploitation of such\nbiodiversity resources contributes greatly to the economy of the country, notably through forest\nexploitation, fisheries, agriculture and tourism, among other activities. This explains why about\n70% of the population is concentrated in coastal areas, depending almost entirely on the\nresources of its ecosystem.\n\nThe plains cover a large part of the territory in the Central and Northeast Regions of the country.\nThe inner Southeast zone is the most rugged part of Guinea-Bissau, other than the hills of Boe,\nthe highest part of the territory, which does not exceed 298 meters in altitude (Mota, 1954).The\nBijagos Islands part of the Archipelago has a morphology similar to the mainland, with a coast\nline that has low altitudes.\nStopped here\nI.1.4 - Population\n\nThe population consists of more than two dozen ethnic groups, with varied social organization,\ncultural values and a diversity of uses and customs, clothes, folklore, music, dance, etc.., The\nGuinean population mainly speaks Guinea-Bissau Creole as a lingua franca, and Portuguese as\nthe official language. The 1991 Census estimated the total population as about 980,000\ninhabitants. Projections based on growth rate fixed at 2.3% per year, estimate the current\npopulation being a little over 1,300,000 inhabitants, the urban population being only 34.8%, life\nexpectancy at 45 years, population density at 42.6 inhabitants/km2 and infant mortality rate at\n125.6 per 1,000 infants (Guinea Bissau: Basic Data, IMF Country Report No 06/313, August\n2006).These same projections, provide the following indicators:\n\n18\n\nWork Force\n\n\nTotal number of workers (millions) 0.6\no % Workers in agriculture 85%\no Proportion of female participation 40.9\n\nNutrition and Health\n\n\nDaily calorie intake (calories per person) 2,070\n\nDoctors (per 1,000 people) 0.1\n\nAccess to drinkable water (% of population) 59\n\nAccess to basic sanitation 34%\n\nEducation (2000)\n\n\nGross enrollment rate\n Primary (% of groups at school age) 69.7\n Girls 55.9%\n\n\nSecondary (% of groups at school age)\n\n Girls 17.8%\n Illiteracy 12.5%\n (% Population over 15 years) 67.8\n\nOfficial statistics listed in the NAPA from 2006, reported that currently the majority of the\npopulation - about 80% - live in the coastal zone, which is richer in biodiversity instead of the\ninner zone or continental where there are five protected areas of the country.About 65.5% of the\nrural population are involved in the exploitation of renewable natural resources (agriculture,\nfisheries, forestry, livestock, extraction) as their major socio-economic activities.\n\nThese inventories mention also that, unfortunately, the poverty rate is still high: 64.7% are\nclassified as poor and about 20.8% as extremely poor (those living on less than $ 1 per day),\naccording to data from DENARP, extracted from the Cursory Survey for Poverty Assessment\n(ILAP -Inquérito Ligeiro para a Avaliação da Pobreza) of 2003. The national labor force, whose\naverage age is between 15-64 years, represents a little more than 46% of the total population of\nthe country. The percentage of women is about 52% and children under 15 years, 46%,\nillustrating that the country is mostly made up of youth.\n\nExisting information about the internal migration movement are scanty, however, the National\nPopulation Policy (Política Nacional de População) document of 2002 states that the\nAutonomous Sector of Bissau (SAB), which only makes up about 3% of the land mass in the\ncountry, hosts more than a quarter of the country’s population and its population mass increased\nfrom 14.2% in 1979 to 25.9% in 2001.\n\nAccording to the Human Development Index Report (HDI), 2006, published by UNDP, GuineaBissau is a part of the group of countries that have the weakest Human Development Index in\nthe world. The HDI of Guinea-Bissau in 2006 was .349 (173rd position out of 177 countries).\n\nOfficial projections indicate a doubling of the Guinean population by the year 2025, i.e., based\non an average growth rate of 2.3%, the population should increase to 2,030,000 inhabitants,\n\n19\n\naccording to Table 2, below, where the projection data of some demographic indicators for the\nperiod 1995-2025, in the referenced table are shown.\n\nTable 2: Details of some of the projected demographic indicators from 1995-2025.\nSource: National Population Policy, 2002.\n\nIndicator / Year\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\n43\n46\n49\n62\n55\n58\n61\nAverage number of children per woman\n8.8\n6.6\n6.4\n6.0\n5.4\n4.8\n4.2\nTotal population of Guinea-Bissau (thousands) 1,073 1,170 1,370 1,470 1,660 1,846 2,030\nPopulation mass of SAB (Bissau)\n22.2\n25.2\n28.5\n32.0\n35.7\n39.5\n43.5\n\nI.1.4 - Economy\n\nGuinea-Bissau is one of the poorest countries of the world, with an estimated GDP of around\n94,768.8 million Franc CFA in 2005, an estimate equivalent to approximately $ 189,537,600\n(u.s.d). The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is estimated at $ 190.1(u.s.d) (IMF\nCountry Report, Guinea-Bissau: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, August 2006).\n\nAccording to PANA, 2006, quoting the macro-economic report produced by UNDP, the country\nentered the millennium with negative economic growth, registering an average rate of -0.4%\nbetween 2001 and 2005.The real GDP per capita has decreased each year between 2001 and\n2004, with the exception of a slight increase of about 1% in 2005.The agricultural sector,\ndominated by cashew nut, is the most important sector of the economy of the country,\ncontributing 62.6% of GDP versus 12.2% for industry and 25.2% for the service sector.\n\nData reveals that public finances were in a very critical situation from the period in reference\n(2001-2004). This is what prevented the government from coping with current costs payments,\nwith a payroll that exceeds its revenue since 2003 (111.9 %, 155.0% and 108.9% in 2003, 2004\nand 2005 respectively), whereas, according to the convergence criteria of UEMOA, salaries\nshould not exceed 35% of overall income.\n\nRecent data from the IMF Report, point to the same performance between 2000 and 2005, and\nthe following contribution has been reported to the formation of real GDP. Table 3 presents the\nGDP (2000-2005) for the Economic Sector.\n\nTable 3: Formation of GDP (2000-2005) for the Economic Sector .\n Source: IMF Country Report No. 6 / 313, August 2006, Guinea-Bissau: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix.\n\nSectors\nYears\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\nPercentage of GDP at cost factor\nPrimary\n59.6\n60.0\n60.0\n61.2\n59.9\n60.3\nSecondary\n11.7\n11.4\n12.0\n12.0\n11.9\n11.7\nTertiary\n28.7\n28.6\n27.9\n26.8\n28.2\n28.1\n\nGuinea-Bissau has significant resources to build a strong economy. It has enormous agricultural,\nhalieutic, touristic potentials and some mineral resources (phosphate, bauxite and oil) that can\nalter this framework in the long term.\n\n20\n\nIn the rural zones, financial systems (banking) are still very weak or non-existent in rural areas\nEnergy and insurance, as well as communications are still less developed. In urban areas, these\nservices are more developed. In short, the infrastructure and development are very limited in\nrural areas.\n\nThe national challenge is to build a strong competitive economy in the international market, with\nparticular emphasis on UEMOA and ECOWAS; an economy that generates jobs and\nopportunities for access to knowledge, know-how and technology , and forge a critical mass of\nwell trained personnel to create wealth that helps to reduce poverty and unemployment,\nespecially in rural areas and in areas critical to sustainable economic growth of the economy.\nI.1.5 - Energy\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a country with abundant wood and water resources and some fossil fuels\n(offshore oil) still to be found and exploited. It depends entirely on imported petroleum products\nfor the production of essential electricity produced by power-plants. Although it has the potential\nfor hydroelectric energy production, so far there are no dams for this purpose. Within the\nframework of ECOWAS and within OMVGB, Guinea-Bissau expects to invest in the field of\nhydropower production in the near future, installing a dam at Saltinho in the Corubal River. This\nis the only river that has a significant hydroelectric potential.\n\nIts physical characteristics, according to the 1st CNSMC 2004, are quite favorable in terms of\nenergetic potential, i.e., the intensity of its average annual flow which is about 425 m 3 / s. The\nCorubal River basin has a total area of 23,840 km2, of which 22% is within the national territory.\nThus, a proposal was made to build a dam of 295 million m 3 in Saltinho, - situated about 170 km\nfrom Bissau City, near Xitole, on the road linking Bissau to Quebo. It is expected to produce 18\nMW of electricity. Studies carried out and included in the 1st CNSMC 2004 provide the indicators\npresented in Table 4.\n\nTable 4: Indicators of Saltinho energy potential .

Currently, these\nand hydropower have not really been used to any significant extent in Guinea-Bissau. As a\nmatter of fact, the potential for tidal energy requires further studies, assuming that the location of\nthe potential area would be near Portogole on the Geba River. The potential for wind energy is\nhigher on islands and coastal areas while solar energy is feasible throughout the national\nterritory.\n\nThe total consumption of electricity in 1994 was 48.7 GWh (equivalent to 4,188 TOE, or about 4\nkep / capita), which represents only 1.35% of the potential capacity for electricity generation,\nestimated in 2001 to be approximately 23.5 MW. (1st CNSMC, 2004).the same document states\nthat field data point to an increasing use of solar energy to meet the needs related to energy\nsupply in various departments, and points out that private entities make greater use of it. By\n2004, global installed power was about 92 kW p, with a tendency to register significant increase\n\n21\n\nin the near future, due to the impact of the Rural Electrification Program, based on the use of\nrenewable energy. Table 5 presents the applications of photo-voltaic technology in GuineaBissau.\n\nApplication of photo-voltaic technology in Guinea-Bissau.

It is estimated that Guinea-Bissau\nwould be able to annually produce between 3,750 and 5,000 kWh per kW installed windmill.\n\nI.2 - NATURAL RESOURCES\n\nI.2.1 - AGRARIAN RESOURCES\n\nThe agricultural sector is predominant in the economy of Guinea-Bissau and is the source of\noccupation of about 80% of the population. This percentage tends to increase due to lack of\nemployment in other areas. Agriculture is structured around the production of rice, cashews nut,\npeanuts and livestock. This sector employs about 82% of the active population, contributes\nabout 93% of the total value of exports and about 50% of GDP. The bulk of agricultural exports\nis made up of cashew nuts, wood and non-timber forest products.\n\nShifting cultivation is the technique traditionally used in upland cultivation. That implies getting\nrid of natural vegetation in areas that were once cultivated for two or three consecutive years,\nleaving them alone for long periods to restore soil fertility (Temudo, 1998). This technique is\nsustainable for low population densities, since the percentage of land cultivated in any period is\nalways low compared to the total area available. However, as the number of the population\nincreases, greater food production becomes necessary. Thus, more areas are going to be\nemployed for agriculture and more rapid reuse of previously cultivated areas, possibly without a\ncomplete regeneration of soil fertility.\n\nCastro (1951) and Cabral (1954), reported that the disorganized clearing of forests to obtain\nagricultural land, burning to free space for agriculture, the regeneration of pastures for cattle,\nthe intensification of the traditional practice of shifting cultivation, poor application of new\ntechnologies and the lack of knowledge about ecological and technological constraints, can\n\n22\n\nresult in loss of forest areas, reduction of fallow periods, and disruption of ecosystem\nsustainability in exploitation, with consequent decrease in soil fertility.\n\nIt is estimated that a little more than a half of the country, about 2.5 million hectares, has\nagricultural, forestry or pastoral vocation (Sceta, 1978). Sources from GAPLA / MARD\n(Agricultural Yearbook, 1997), reported that ninety thousand (90,000) family farms are\nresponsible for 90% of total agricultural production in the country. The remaining 10% is\nproduced by the commercial farming sector, with some level of agricultural mechanization, which\nis practiced by 1,200 \"farmers” occupying 27% of agricultural land and 9% of the area of the\ncountry. The average area per farmer is estimated at 136 hectares.\n\nI.2.1.1 - Agriculture\n\nAccording to data from the Department of Agricultural Statistics, which is part of the Office of\nAgricultural Planning at the Ministry of Agriculture, (referred to in the PANA 2006), GuineaBissau has a strong potential for land appropriate for agriculture, estimated at 1,410,000ha,\nrepresenting approximately 30% of the total area of the country of which 200,000ha are\nlowlands under the influence of continental freshwater (rice fields of bas-fonds ) 106,000ha\ncoastal lowlands under the influence of saline water ( mangrove rice fields ) and 1,104,000ha of\nplateau ecology. However, this potential is underutilized: only 29.000ha (14.5%) of bas-fond\nlands and 50.000ha mangrove lands (47.2%) are currently used. According to the same data at\nthe national level, the cultivated area reaches about 200.000ha (18% of potential). Rice is grown\non a surface of about 70.000ha, of which 37% relates to the pluvial rice (pam-pam), 63% is rice\nof bas-fonds and mangroves. Rice is the base cereal of Guinean’s diet (130Kgs/person/year) but\nup until now, domestic production does not meet domestic demand, taking into account that\n60,000 tons are imported per year. Other cereals that are not less important for the diet are; corn\n(about 15.000ha), millet (31.000ha), sorghum and couscous, covering a total of 67.000ha whose\nproduction range between 500 to 1000Kg per hectare.

Even so, the country still has a significant area of forest.\n\nIn the following table data from inventories conducted by the SCET International in 1978 and\nAtlanta Consult in 1985 are shown.\n\nTable 10: Development of forest areas from 1978 to 1985, adapted from the document\n Elements d'un Plan Directeur d'Aménagement et de Gestion de Ressources Naturelles, 1992.\n\n24\n\nTypes of forests\nAreas (ha)\nInternational Secretariat\n1978 (ha)\nAreas (ha)\nAtlanta Consult\n1985 (ha)\nDifferences of\nAreas\n(Ha)\nSub-humid forests\n178,800\n135,431\n43,369\nDry forest\n848,300\n844,959\n3,341\nGallery Forest\n79,950\n52,909\n2,.041\nSavannas\n1,237,900\n996,985\n240,915\nTotal\n2,344,950\n2,030,284\n314,666\n\nAccording to Atlanta Consult (1985), the Guinean forest covered an area of about 2.1 million\nhectares and the timber reserve was 48.300.000m 3.In recent years, the timber industry has\nbeen exerting great pressures on the country's forest sector, mainly in southern forests (PNGA,\n2004) and Cassama (2006). This ecosystem is of great interest from the standpoint of\nbiodiversity conservation, not only because of plant formations that compose them, but also\nbecause they serve as a habitat for many species, some of which are emblematic such as the\nchimpanzee, Pan troglodytes (Limoges, 1989).\n\nWith use of satellite images, under the Quantification of Stored Carbon and Sink Capacity of\nForest Vegetation of the Guinea-Bissau - CARBOVEG-GB Project, areas of four types of\nforest vegetation were quantified (Dense Forest, Open Forest, Arborized Savanna and\nMangrove) and concluded that in 2007, the estimated forest area - dense forest and open forest\n- is around 786,215ha, as expressed in the following table.\n\nTable 11: Four types of forest vegetation areas in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nYears\nDense\nForest\nOpen Forest\nArborized\nSavanna\nMangrove\nHerbaceous\nsavanna\n1990\n136,786\n1,109,853\n1,232,883\n261,022\n72,527\n1994\n97,563\n759,827\n1,521,518\n289,113\n167,383\n2002\n89,063\n784,288\n1,578,993\n320,805\n64,566\n2007\n147,865\n638,350\n1,582,289\n314,786\n152,284\n786,215\n\nThe forest inventory of Atlanta Consult (1985) estimated the rate of annual forest growth at 1.5\nmillion m 3 / year, compared to a degradation of forest capital by the timber industry equivalent to\napproximately 600,000 m 3 / year. According to (PAFT, 1992 in: PANA, 2006), the national\nconsumption of wood in 1992, was estimated at 1.2 million m 3 corresponding to an increase of\n8.3% per year, equivalent to a value of 81% of wood energy, 6% lumber and 8% timber for\nservice (construction).This corresponds to an annual cut of approximately 132,000 ha of timber.\nThis level of consumption contrasts sharply with the average growth of forest, which is on the\norder of 0.3m 3 / ha / year. An annual exploitation of 2,100,000 m 3 / year was estimated in 1992;\na national consumption of wood between 4,000 to 5,000 m 3 / year and production of lumber,\nfrom 3,000 to 20,000 m 3 / year. The degradation caused by deforestation in villages and farms\nand by fires, is estimated to be between 30,000 and 60,000 ha / year, according to A Study to\nSupport the Forestry Sector in Guinea-Bissau, (Estudo para um apoio ao sector florestal na\nGuiné-Bissau) 1997.\n\nThe timber industry, which until 1992, was operated by ten sawmills with an obsolete technology\npark and the ability to process a maximum of 40,000m3 of round timber 20,000 m 3 / year of\n\n25\n\nsawn timber, focused mainly on the exploitation of the species of red wood (Pterocarpus\neinaceous), pau de conta (Afzelia africana) and bissilão (Khaya senegalensis).\n\nIn the following table the impact indicators of the annual wood production are shown\n\nTable 12: Estimated levels of timber production by forest type (adapted).\n\nType of Forest\nAnnual\nAverage\nGrowth\n(M 3 / ha /\nyear)\nArea\n(Ha)\nTotal annual\nproduction of wood\n(M 3 / year)\nDense dry forest\nDense forest\nDegraded forest\nForest in transition\n\n0.994\n0.404\n(0.404)\n\n90,400\n62,400\n20,000\n\n89,858\n22,210\n8,080\nOpen forest\nDense forest\nDegraded forest\n\n0.474\n0.288\n\n189,600\n747,200\n\n89,870\n170,362\nSavannah\nPalm\nMangrove\nRiverbank forest\n0.245\n-\n-\n(0.474)\n926,000\n80,000\n248,400\n93,200\n226,870\npm\nuntapped\n44,177\nTOTAL\n\n2,457,200\n654,427\n\nSource: PANA (2006) and FDFN (1992).\n\nThe current pressure from the timber industry already has its reflections in the dense forest,\nparticularly in the South. According to preliminary data from the CARBOVEG-GB Project, it\nappears that from 1990 to 2007, the rate of deforestation of the open forest is more pronounced\nat around 27,735 ha / year, in contrast to the dense forest that has recovered its growth at\n651,70 ha / year.\n\nAs for mangroves, the data collected in the periods 1953-1959 and 1976-1990, indicated that\nbetween these two periods, the rate of deforestation increased from 2,000 ha / year to 3,830 ha /\nyear (CIRAD / PAFT / DGFC, 1992). According to data from the CARBOVEG-GB Project, this\nrate has been decreasing at 3,162 ha / year since 1990, consistent with figure 6. Thus the\npercentage of area occupied by mangroves in 1990 was 8.3% of national territory and in 2007\nthis percentage increased slightly to 9.6%.\n\nThe pressure on forest resources increases intensity every year under pressure by the market,\non the one hand, and on the other by the necessity for the survival of an extremely needy\npopulation which also increases the pressure on these resources. Thus, the growing demand for\nwood products and charcoal (in households, as an energy source), the exploitation of cibes\nwood (for house construction) and wood (for furniture industry) in the urban market and the like,\nhave encouraged more people to uncontrollably exploit forest resources for commercial\npurposes, causing irreparable damage to forests and biodiversity.\n\nIn the country, forests are still used by the population as a source of many wild fruits, medicinal\nplants, hunting, exploitation of honey and wax, fiber and diverse craftworks, among others. It is\nacknowledged however, that there are no studies adequately illuminating on the quantity and\nwhat value that these exploited forest resources represent overall, for the communitarian family\nand national economy (PANA, 2006).\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the country is to ensure growth and sustainable exploitation of\nforest resources. For that purpose, the ongoing policies intend to counteract the current trend of\ndegradation risk of its forest capital. By virtue of its forestall wealth, these Guinean resources are\n\n26\n\nenormous and can, with an ecologically sound investment and technologically competitiveness,\nplay a relevant role in the development of the national economy. Thus the identification and\nquantification of such resources are essential to support a rural development policy based on\nconservation and sustainability of ecosystem services.\n\nWith regard to Wood Energy Production System, firewood and charcoal are the main source of\nnational energy and play a predominant role in the daily lives of populations. Fuel from wood\naccounts for 90% of energy consumption. About 85% comes from wood and 5% comes from\ncharcoal). According to Bianchi (1986), its demand is around 1.2 million m 3 / year, accounting\nfor 80.6% of forest production. Per capita consumption, at the national level is 2 kg of firewood\nper person per day (PAFT, 1992).\n\nIn large population centers, the consumption of charcoal is between 115,000 and 120,000 tons\nper year, contrarily to what happens in rural areas where consumption was estimated at 66,000\ntons per year and household needs for firewood from 550,000 to 585,000 tons / year (PAFT,\n1992). The system of production of wood energy for domestic purposes in the country is carried\nout in forested areas of the countryside. For its part, forest residues represent 65% of the total of\na tree: part of the trunk is used for energetic purposes and the other parts are abandoned in the\nwoods without any valorization. Sawdust represents 40% of each trunk.\n\nAccording to Cabral (1999), there are a dozen of industrial plants and only six (6) produce about\n30,000 3 of wood. These activities generate 55.000m 3 of waste at the level of logging, which can\nproduce about 12,000 tons of charcoal if the technique of improved furnaces for carbonization is\nused or the recognized revenue that would cover a significant portion of the energy needs of\nlarge cities. It should be noted that currently, the commercial exploitation of charcoal has been\ngrowing compared to the exploitation of firewood.\n\nI.2.1.3 - Livestock\n\nCattle raising is practiced throughout the country, integrating all the systems of agricultural\nproduction. More than 75% of bovine, 54% of ovine, 64% of caprine, 34% of porcine, 95% of\nasinine and 86% of equines are found in the Regions of Bafata and Gabu, according to data\nfrom the DEA / DGP (2006 ) and PANA (2006). Bovine cattle, is the most important, according to\nprojections that Figure 4 illustrates.\n\nFigure 4: Projection of livestock from 1991 to 2006).\n\n400,000\n450,000\n500,000\n550,000\n600,000\n650,000\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\nBovine\n\nSource: DEA / PGD.\n\n27\n\nMost of the cattle are managed by farmers who belong to the Fulani ethnic group. There are only\na few units for the intensive production of poultry and eggs implanted, all of which are\nconcentrated in Bissau.\n\nThere is a large unexploited potential that could substantially increase livestock production. The\nestimated data in 1993, indicated a production of 3,000 tons of beef, 2,000 tons of small\nruminants meat ; 9,000 tons of pork meat, 1,000 tons of chicken, 12,000 tons of milk and\n604,000 tons of eggs. (Greenhouse Gas Emissions Report - Agricultural and Livestock Sector,\n2007).\n\nThe livestock of the country is facing difficulties to provide water for animals, with higher\nincidence in areas where the main aquifer units are located in the Continental Terminal In those\nareas, the transhumance of cattle becomes a vital necessity for their creators, which in many\ncases, have seen the number of their animals reduce, due to the long distances they have to go\nthrough. Therefore the application of techniques to retain water during the rainy season could be\nan effective option for the transhumance of livestock in those areas.\n\nI.2.2 - WATER RESOURCES\n\n Guinea-Bissau is covered by a hydrographic network that consists of flowing streams and\nstagnant water courses. Among the flowing streams, rivers and their tributaries are included -\nthe main rivers being from North to South, the Cacheu, Mansoa, the Geba, the Corubal, Rio\nGrande de Buba, the Cumbijã and Cacine Rivers branches and estuaries [1] .Specialized\nstudies confirm the deep interpenetration of land and sea in a distance ranging between 150 and\n175 km where saltwater goes inland under the influence of tides. This will characterize the\nexistence of inverse estuaries in most cases.\n\nAt the level of stagnant waters, some lakes and ponds, including namely the Cufada Lake is\nhighlighted, including lakes of Bionra and Bedasse, which are the largest limned water reserves\nof the country (Imbali, F. and Silva, A.O., 1997) and also those found in the terrestrial islands, for\nexample, group of Orango islands in the Bolama Bijagos Archipelago -and bas-fonds of\nfreshwater (1st CNSMC, 2004). The river network in Guinea-Bissau is shown in the figure below\n.\n\nFigure 5: Hydrographic network in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nSource: Taken from the doctoral thesis of G. Pennober, 1st CNSMC, 2004.\n\n28\n\nThe Corubal River, with an average annual volume of 130,000 million m 3 and very significant\nflow rates, (11 m 3 / s on average), during the dry season, is the most important surface water\nresource in the country. The rocky side post of Cussilinta protects the resource from penetration\nof seawater. The current exploitation of the waters of Corubal is limited to some hydraulic\nequipment for hydro-agriculture. (1st CNSMC, 2004).\n\nAccording to data from this same source, the hydraulic contribution of the Geba River is more\nmodest, and the average annual volume is estimated at Bafata as being 800 million m 3, and\nthere are periods of drought at some of its tributaries, as is the case of Bidigor. The current\nvolumes are only half of the amount mentioned, due to the combined effect of drought and\nvolumes diverted for irrigation for agricultural lands of Anambé, Senegal. The flow volume of the\nGeba River is also affected by the construction of dams at Anambé and Kaleta. The decrease in\nflow rates and the weak slope of the river may have the effect of rising of salt water, imperiling\nthe existing hydro-agricultural potential of Bafata’s upstream. Some non permanent communities\nextract from the standing water for irrigation.\n\n[1] All of them except the Corubal River, lead to the Bijagós Delta (as is the case of Geba) or the Atlantic Ocean.\nBoth the Geba River as the Coruba River emerges from the Futa Djalon Mountains in Guinea-Conakry. The other that\nemerges in the Guinean inland are powered by the Continental terminal.\nIn short, the country has significant water resources, according to the Headmaster Scheme\nDGRH 1997, estimated at 14 billion/ m3 per year, and renewable resources of the deep aquifers\nevaluated between 8 to 29 billion m3 per year and surface aquifers in the hundreds of billions of\nm3/year. In 1991, the exploitation of surface water from the Geba and Corubal\nRivers was estimated at 1.5 million m 3. .According to PANA (2006), the rate of access to drinking\nwater is only 45.3% for residents in rural areas, compared to 78.9% for the populations living in\nthe Capital, Bissau City (Azinhaga et al. 2005 and 1st CNSMC, 2004).\nI.2.3 - FISHING RESOURCES\n\nGuinea-Bissau is a country of vast coastal area, estimated at 22 235 km ² (equivalent to 61% of\nthe country) and where 80% of its total population live. It has a coastline extension estimated at\n170 kms. Fishing is exercised based on important production potential, favored by a low depth\nvalued continental shelf, by the extension of the maritime front and the existence of the marine\ndelta represented by the Bijagos Archipelago. Its EEZ has important high commercial value\nfishery resource, exploited by licensing for the practice of traditional and industrial fishery. The\nGeneral Law on Fisheries and the Regulation of Traditional Fishing, revised in 2007, regulate\nthe activity of this sector.\n\nFishing activity focuses on certain species, which represent a biomass estimated at about\n1,300,000 tons. The exploitable fraction of that biomass is fixed at 20%, according to the Plan for\nSustainable Management of Fisheries Resources in force that is 200,000 tons of demersal and\npelagic species of high commercial value and about 100,000 tons of \"BALISTE species (species\nof low economic value and minimally exploited).\n\nIt is noteworthy that studies of the sector indicate that only 20% that is exploitable is accessible\nto traditional fisheries at a potential of around 34,000 tons of demersal species of high\ncommercial value and 110,000 tons of pelagic species (Lopes, 2001). Traditional fisheries,\naccording to the author in reference, are dominated by the existence of non-motorized canoes,\nhaving increased between 1989 and 1995 at 300% both in the number of canoes and in number\nof fishermen. Consequently, catch levels have also increased by about 400%, i.e. 10,000 tons in\n1989 compared to 52,000 tons in 1995.\n\n29\n\nNow with the emergence of numerous illegal encampments (12 were surveyed by IBAP in the\nBolama / Bijagós Region Biosphere in 2005) of fishermen from the sub-region, were reported\npractice of piracy in the area of traditional fishing (12 miles).The fisheries’ authorities presume\nthat harvest levels have increased significantly.\n\nBeyond 12 nautical miles, foreign fishing fleets practice industrial fishing through licenses\nassigned to them. Between 1990 and 1996, data collected and provided in the documents of the\n1st CNSMC (2004, p.34) indicated that 115 kg / h as the average catch per unit, and 370 kg / h\nas the highest catches recorded in fleet of fish compared to only 71 kg / h for the cephalopodan\nones and around 14 kg / h for the capture of shrimp. The levels of piracy, which is observed in\nthe Exclusive Economic Zone of Guinea-Bissau (EEZ), assume that the volume of catch that is\nnot recorded, is by far superior to those observed in the period 1990-1996.\n\nI.2.4 - BIODIVERSITY\n\n Guinea-Bissau is rich in flora and fauna resources, thanks to its extremely varied vegetation cover\n(dense and open forests, savannas, palm groves and mangroves). It has an important Protected\nAreas Network of 470,000 ha, equivalent to about 13% of the total area of the country, excluding a\nBiosphere Reserve (Bolama / Bijagós) which has an area of 10,700 kms. Protected Areas Network\nconsists of three Continental parks, two marine, a community protected area, resulting in rich well\nconserved biodiversity. It should be noted, though, that there is a process of creating a national\nsystem of Protected Areas with the proclamation of the Dulombi-Boe-Tchetche complex as new\nterrestrial parks.\n\nThus, both in the 1st CNSMC (2004), and in PANA (2006) the broader context of biodiversity is\nunderscored. The existence of species considered threatened it is noted, as is the case of\nleatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea,) lamantim (Trichechus senegalensis), Sharks\n(Carcharinidae-Rhizoprindon\nacutus,\nCarcharhinus\nlimbatus),\nskates\n(Rhinobatidae\n-\nRhinobatos Rhinobatos, Rhinobatos cemiculus) and red-tailed mullet. Data available from\ninventories, point to the existence of 160 families of flora, of which about 12 species are endemic.\n\nTable 13: Species representative of Guinean flora.\n\nRepresentative species of the SudanoGuinean domain\nSpecies representative of the\nGuinean domain\nCommon species\n\nIncense stick (Daniella oliveri)\nBissilão (Khaya senegalensis)\nLophira lanceolata\nGuava lala (Schreber arborea)\nTambacumba (Parini macrophila)\nManconi (Erytrophleum guineensis)\nFaroba of lala (Albizia Zizia)\nAccount (Afzelia africana)\nPoilão forum (Bombax costatum)\nBush mango (Cordila pinnata)\nMacit (Terminalia macroptera)\nFaroba (Parkia biglobosa)\nCarbon (Prosopis africana)\nBlood (Pterocarpus Erinaceus)\nFidida white (Federbia albia)\nMampataz (Parini excelsa)\nYellow beast (Chlorophora regia)\nBlack bug (antiaris africana)\nCIBE (Boatlanta rrasus aethiopium)\nAfrican antiaris\nChlorophora regia\nVelvet (Diallium guineensis)\nPalm (Elaeis guineensis)\nMampataz (Parini excelsa)\nAccount (Afzelia africana)\nAlbizzia aiantthifolia\nBao bao (Ceiba pentandra)\nIncense sick (Daniella oliveri)\nDetarium senegalensis\nManconi\n(Erytrophleum\nguineensis)\nCibes\n(Borassus\naiethiopiu)\nMoruss mesozygia\nParinari macrophyla\nMangrove\n(Rhizophora\nracemosa)\n\nSource: Atlanta Consult, 1985.\n\n30\n\nAs for fauna, the following were identified:\n\n\n11 species of primates;\n\n21 species of carnivores;\n\n19 ungulates;\n\n8 species of rodents;\n\n10 species of bats;\n\n374 bird species, divided into about 31 families, especially about 30 species\nwhich include sandpipers, gulls and terns;\n\n85 species of reptiles and 31 amphibians inventoried (only in the Bijagos\nArchipelago).\n\nThe Bijagos Archipelago, is a wetland zone of international importance, since it hosts more than\n1% of the world’s population of birds. As already referred to, it is a Biosphere Reserve, Don to\nEarth since 2004.\n\nI.2.5 - SOIL\n\nIn Guinea-Bissau the following types of soil are distinguished: Ferralsoils, Plintosoils, sandysoils,\nhydromorphicsoils and other types of substrate (Bouali, mud and sands).\n\nIn the table below, the area occupied and percentage occupancy for each soil type is shown.\n\nTable 14: Types of soil, surface and % of occupancy (adapted).\n\nSoil types\nArea (ha)\n% Occupancy\n1 - Ferralsoils (Ferralítics and Fersialítics)\n1,960,000\n62\n2 - Plinthosoils (Litolics and Litosoils)\n550,000\n17\n3 - Sandysoils (Regosoils psamitic)\n20,000\n1\n4 - Hidromírtic Soils:\n 4.1 - Gleisoils (Continental)\n 4.2 - Riverine (Derived from marine alluvium)\n650,000\n150,000\n500,000\n20\n5\n15\n 4.2.1 - Tropical polders\n 4.2.2 - Halo - hydromorphic\n100,000\n400,000\n3\n12\n\nSource: Teixeira, 1962.\n\nThe soil groups most representative in Guinea-Bissau are Ferralsoils, Plintosoils, Gley soils, and\nFluvisoil. Sandysoils, as well as other classes of substrate that are not considered soil, such as\nsilt and lateritic bench (Teixeira, 1962, FAO- ISRIC-ISSS, 1998; CORN-DA-CONCEPTION,\n2001). The soil map is shown in figure 7, Teixeira, 1962.\n\n31\n\nFigure 6 Map Soil Guinea-Bissau (adapted)\n\nSource: Teixeira, 1962.\nNorth, South and Bijagós Islands\n\nFerralsoils, which in Teixeira’s nomenclature (1962) correspond to ferralític and fersialític soils,\ncover most of the Northern and Southern Regions as well the Bijagos Archipelago. They have\nsandy or sandy-clay texture and are among the deepest soils in the country, but are relatively\npoor whether in organic matter and in mineral nutrients.\n\nThe natural vegetation of Guinea-Bissau Ferralsoils is mainly open forest, though, when weather\nconditions allow, can develop dense sub-humid forest, as in the Southwest (Malaisse, 1996).\nMuch of the so-called shifting farming system is done on this type of soil, including upland rice,\npeanut (groundnut) farming, as well as cashew trees planting.\n\nInterior / Southeast Zone\n\nPlinth soils are mainly in the inner part of the country, especially in the Southeast and Coastal\nRegions, to a lesser extent,. They are poor mineral soils, of small effective depth, which present\nshallow layers of more or less consolidated lateritic material. They correspond to a large extent,\nto the litho soils and litolic soils registered by Teixeira (1962). Most Plinth soils bear, (at low\ndepth) petroplinthic horizons corresponding to what is commonly known as laterite.\n\nAlthough they largely have low agricultural capability, Plinthosols are also often cultivated as dry\narable land for rice, corn and peanuts. However, with the itinerant agriculture of tree clearing and\nburning, they become vulnerable to erosion (CASTRO, 1951) becoming thinner and eventually\nthe consolidated lateritic material may come to the surface in what is Boual. Therefore, it’s\nnotable that the open forest and wooded savanna communities are more common in natural\nvegetation of Plinth soils.\n\n32\n\nNorthwest and Southwest Coastal Regions of Mainland\n\nIn these regions and some islands of the Bijagos Archipelago, such as Orango and Formosa,\naerosols are found, although in a small fraction of the territory. They are sandy soils mainly\nquartz, with little deep organic matter, that are well drained and derived from consolidated\ndunes. Psamitic Regosoils correspond to the nomenclature used by Teixeira (1962) and\nsometimes mounted on muddy deposits, so that in depressed areas they can have high\nhumidity. They are occupied mostly by wooded savannah.\n\nInterior lowlands and higher parts of rivers\n\nGleisoils occur in inner lowlands and along the upper and middle sections of rivers on the\nmainland and some islands of the Bijagos Archipelago. These soils have fine texture and\noriginate from alluvial, generally rich in organic matter in the upper horizons. They evolve under\ntemporary swamping, presenting hydro-orphism, although sometimes poorly marked. They are\nconsidered to be derived from materials consisting of fine sand and / or limos earth, usually in a\nhigh percentage, transported by water and deposited on the surfaces by natural drainage.\nAccording to Teixeira (1962), they correspond to hydromorphic that come from continental\norigin.\n\nThe main natural vegetation on these soils is called lala, almost exclusively herbaceous savanna\nfrom the lowlands which are periodically flooded, as well on the edge of these areas and in less\nswampy or elevated zones. There are also Elaeis guineensis palm-trees on these soils. These\nsoils are also often used for irrigated rice cultivation, constituting freshwater rice fields.\n\nCoast Line and Lower Rivers Areas\n\nFluvisoils occur in these areas. These soils are fine textured of fluvial origin, often affected by\nsalt or brackish water and therefore high in sodium. According to Teixeira’s (1962), classification,\nthey correspond to hydromorphic soils derived from marine alluvium. The natural vegetation on\nthese soils consists mainly of mangroves and saltwater lala. The Fluvisoils are more fertile than\nthe Gleisoils and are often used for growing rice in so-called salty water rice fields. Through the\nconstruction of levees, rain water is gradually desalted , constituting the so-called tropical\n\"polders\" (Teixeira, 1962).\n\nCufada Park, by Corubal\n\nIn this area, where there are outcrops of dolerite, the lixissoils derived from basic rocks are\nregistered (MILHO-DA-CONCEICAO, 2001).The vegetation on these soils consists of wide\nforrests tree specimens, which can be explained either by the characteristics of the soil, or by\nproximity to the Corubal River. On a smaller scale, Boual also exist.\n\nBoé Region\n\nIn this region other types of substrate - Boual exist, which is an area where a lateritic shield of\nvariable thickness is on the surface without being covered with fine soil particles. Human activity,\nrelating to the destruction of natural vegetation through overthrowing and / or burning, can\ncontribute to accelerate the destruction of soil and outcrop on the surface of the lateritic\nbreastplates in an unpredictable scale (CASTRO, 1951).\n\nWest Zone of the mainland and some islands\n\n33\n\nThese areas have coastal sands and siltstones. Alluvial deposits, with no stratification, are\ndistributed along the periodically flooded margins of much of the coast, where areas are\ncolonized by mangroves.\n\nI.2.6 - MINERAL RESOURCES\n\nThe inventory of Guinea-Bissau minerals is reported in the General Directorate of Geology and\nMining, in a database system with 85 minerals, 12 of which are useful; sands, gravel, clay,\nkaolin, laterite, shell limestone, quartzite, granite, dolerite, bauxite, black sand and phosphate.\nThe country's potential in minerals was assessed and a plan has been outlined for their\ndevelopment in order to assist the Government to outline its mineral policy.\n\nThe mining of bauxite is already underway in the area of Boe and includes a paved road linking\nQuebo to Boké with preliminary work already underway to construct new roads linking the area\nof bauxite exploitation to the Port of Buba (Cuntabane-Boe-Munhini), as well as other new roads\nthat will link Tchetche-Beli-Boké, Gabu-Canquelifa-Buruntuma Boké-and-Pirada CanquelifaBuruntuma-Boké.\n\nAccording to the Angola Bauxite Company, this region of the country has nine (9) bauxite\ndeposits, six (6) of which are of great importance, given their significant quantities in reserves\nand their high contents. Studies confirm that there are proven reserves of around 113 million\ntons of bauxite and over 100 million tons classified as reserves. Using an estimated production\nof about 2 million tons per year, the life expectancy of the proved reserves would be about 56\nyears, according to the Bauxite Angola Website, (presented in the Reference Section in Annex).\n\nIts exploitation will be carried out through open mining, which may increase the emission of solid\nparticles in the atmosphere. The soil where it will be exploited, (even if restored), could lose its\nability to retain water, making it unsuitable for annual crops and as a result cause significant\nrainforest destruction. According to Switkes, (2007) tropical areas where bauxite ore is found\nusually are strongholds of biodiversity on earth. This mining activity may have an impact on the\ndegradation of landscape, noise and vibration, dust and gas, water contamination, siltation of\nperipheral lakes, waste production, motor vehicle traffic, etc... (Silva 2007).\n\nThree (3) major investments are projected in infrastructure, including a port in the town of Buba,\na highway and a power supply system to enable the evacuation of mining production.\n\nThe opening of the highway linking Cuntabane-Boe-Munhini and the widening of the road from\nBuba to the Buba Port has decimated large areas of forests, which led to fragmentation of the\nlandscape in some areas whose consequences are serious for some species. Even more new\nhighways may possibly be opened linking various operating mining sites or deposits.\n\nThe deforestation performed as a result of opening new roads to the Buba Port may contribute\nto the destruction of biodiversity, erosion and soil depletion (Leach and Lateritization), siltation of\nrivers (vendus), decreasing of rainfall rate, increasing of temperature, desertification,\nproliferation of diseases and pests.\n\nAccording to information, some companies have carried out exploration in 12 offshore petroleum\nblocks, with a positive perspective for exploitation.\n\nThus, taking into account the environmental threats that the exploitation of these minerals imply,\naccording to the way they are being done, it is urgent to carry out an environmental impact study\nand elaborate proposals for mitigation measures, so that the exploitation of these minerals does\n\n34\n\nnot cause adverse effects on the environment (soil, vegetation, fisheries resources, among\nothers).\n\nII - INVENTORY OF GREENHOUSE GASES\n\nII.1 - Introduction\n\nthe UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in 1992, in order to\nstabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere at levels that prevent dangerous interference to\nthe planet climate system. The Kyoto Protocol, ratified by 161 parties, entered into force in\nFebruary 2005, and serves as the instrument which advocates an overall reduction of GHG\nemissions by 5% over the 2008-2012 period, compared to emissions in 1990.\n\nGuinea-Bissau ratified the UNFCCC on 27 October 1995, thereby becoming party to the\nConvention. It assumed engagement to develop, update, publish and communicate to the\nConferences of the Parties (COP), the national inventories of GHG emissions and removals. The\nKyoto Protocol was ratified by the ANP on 18 November 2005.\n\nThis work was performed in the ambit of the 2nd National Communication, in order to estimate\nemissions of CO 2 and other non-CO 2 gases in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau in 2006\n(reference year) relating to:\n The use of energy;\n Industry;\n Cattle-breeding;\n The change of land use and forestry;\n Waste\n\nII.2 - DATA USED\n\nII.2.1 - Energy\n\nII.2.1.1 - CO 2 Emission from burning liquid fossil fuels.\n\nTaking into consideration the fact that all of the products that are consumed are imported, it was\npossible to estimate emissions of CO 2 coming from the burning of fossil fuels. All liquid fuels\nused in the national sectors of land and maritime transport, industry, agriculture and energy selfproducers (domestic generators, etc.)... Table 15 presents data used to estimate CO2 emissions\nfrom the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nTable 15 - Data used to calculate the CO 2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nProducts\nImported\nQuantity\n(Ton)\nConversion\nFactor (TJ / Unit)\nCarbon\nEmission\nFactor (tC / TJ)\nFraction of\ncarbon oxidized\nDiesel\n40,529.9\n0.04316\n20.2\n0.99\nGasoline\n4,893.4\n0.04495\n18.9\n0.99\nJET\n1,019.7\n0.04387\n19.6\n0.99\nGPL\n510.5\n0.04786\n17.2\n0.99\nOil\n10:53\n0.04387\n19.6\n0.99\nLubricant\n183.1\n0.0409\n18\n0.99\nTar\n3,434.4\n0.04057\n17.2\n0.99\n\nThe quantity of imported products in 2006, was obtained through the data provided by the DGE /\nDSDP (State Planning and Statistics), DGA (Customs General Directorate), Petromar Petroleum\n\n35\n\nCompany, Total Petroleum Company and “Étude de Ethanol” (UEMOA / WAEMU Ethanol\nStudy). The conversion factors and the carbon emission and the fraction of oxidized carbon were\nextrapolated from the IPCC manual (1996).\n\nII.2.1.2 - CO 2 emission from offsite burning of biomass\n\nDespite doing information and awareness campaigns carbonization techniques and advocating\nfor more economical stoves in the country, there is presently an increase in the production and\nconsumption of products of vegetable biomass (firewood and charcoal). The biomass produced\nin rural areas is for consumption in both urban and semi-urban areas populations.\n\nBeing an informal sector, obtaining data on consumption of vegetable biomass is not precise,\ngiven that its activity is difficult to monitor and follow up. Thus, according to UEMOA / PRBE\n(2007), the consumption of vegetable biomass was estimated at 933,167 tons for 2006, and percapita consumption was around 1.39 tons, or 1,390 kg / hab. The emissions conversion factors,\nand the fraction of carbon oxidized used are the ones proposed by the IPCC (1996).\n\nII.2.1.3 - CO 2 emission by air and sea transportation\n\nData in the table #15 and #16 JET were used to estimate CO 2 emissions from aviation. Is\nshould be noted that given the lack of data on international shipping, this was neglected in this\nestimate.\n\nII.2.1.4 - Emission of other non-CO 2 GHGs by sector\n\nThe consumption of petroleum products is dominated by the transport sector. According to the\npetroleum product’s consumption structure for 2006, the transport sector consumed about\n66.14% of it and electricity about 30%, industry, agriculture and fisheries sectors, around 2%, 1\n%, 0.86%, respectively. Note that diesel is the fuel most consumed in the country.\n\nTable 16 shows the petroleum consumption structure of products by sector of activity.\n\nTable 16 - Structure of consumption of petroleum products by sectors of activities in tons, adapted from\nDGE, DEPPE, DGA\n\nConsumption\nDiesel\nGasoline\nGPL\nJet\nKerosene\nLubricants\nRump\n\nTransport\nTotal\n26,806.4\n8\n3,725.83\n0\n1,019.\n7\n0\n56.76\n0\nTerrestrial\n24,930.0\n2\n3,236.49\n0\n0\n0\n-\n0\nMaritime\n1,876.46\n489.34\n0\n0\n0\n-\n0\nAir\n0\n0\n0\n1019.7\n0\n-\n0\nProduction of Electricity\n12,158.9\n7\n0\n0\n0\n0\n109.86\n0\nIndustry\n810.598\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5,493\n0\nAgriculture and\nfisheries\n754.1\n575,7\n0\n0\n0\n7,324\n0\nDomestic\n0\n591.87 c)\n510.4\n9\n0\n10:53\n3,662\n421\nOther Activities\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n3,013.4\n\nII.2.2 - Industry\n\nIn order to report GHG emissions from production processes in the industrial sector, the\nproduction of foods and alcoholic beverages were considered.\n\nII.2.2.1 - Production of food (bread and cashew nuts processing)\n\n36\n\nThe bread-making sector (small traditional bakeries) occupies a prominent place in all the agrofood industries in the country. The bakeries in the country may either be electrical or traditionally\nbuilt ones. The electrical ones exists in reasonable numbers, allowing an accurate\ndeterminations of their data, contrarily to the data from traditionally built bakeries, which operate\nbased on vegetable biomass that have been proliferating across the country. Each of these\nbakeries is a potential emissary that must not be neglected in the estimation of GHG emissions.\nThe data used in the calculations were provided by the Industry General Directorate -DGI, (the\nentity responsible for authorizing and legalizing the bread-making activity) and by the GuineaBissau Association of Bread-makers.\n\nAs for the cashew nuts industrial processing sector and their derivatives, it should be noted that\nsmall processing units are gradually expanding, taking into account the enterprises currently\noperating and the portfolio of projects submitted by entrepreneurs.\n\nThe data contained in the table below were provided by DGI, the National Cashew Commission\nand the National Association of Private Professionals (Quantity of food produced) and emission\nfactors by the IPCC manual, 1996.\n\nTable 17 - Data from the food sector and their emission factors\n\nType of Food Production\nQuantity of Food\nProduced (t)\nEmission Factor (kg NMVOC / t of\nprocessed food\nBread-making\n12,960\n8\nProcessing of cashew nuts\n7,600\n18\n\nII.2.2.2 - Production of alcoholic beverages (wine and brandy)\n\nAlcoholic beverages production activities in Guinea-Bissau consist of the transformation of sugar\ncane into brandy and cashew fruits into juice, which naturally transforms into wine. This is oldest\nindustrial activity in Guinea that can be remembered. Data from this activity sub-sector were\ncollected from the DGI and enterprises operating in this sector. We considered micro and small\nwine and brandy production units in the North, East and Mid-Country.\n\nThe national alcoholic beverage production industrial zone of this sub-sector is in a remote\nphase allowing for the emission of greenhouse gases during their production process. Currently\nthe production of wine in the country is done in a small plant located at the industrial zone in Bra,\nwhose production capacity is estimated at around 2,035 hl. It should be noted that there are\nother micro units of production that use traditional processes.\n\nThe production of beer and soft drinks in Guinea-Bissau were not considered in this study, given\nthat since 2002 their processing plants have not been operational.\n\nIn Table 18, data for the sector of beverages production and their emission factors are\npresented.\n\nTable 18 - Data from the alcoholic beverages sector and their emission factors.\n\nType of Alcoholic\nBeverages\nQuantity of alcoholic\nbeverages produced (hl)\nEmission Factor (kg NMVOC / hl of\nbeverages produced)\nBrandy\n7,410\n15\nWine\n2,035\n0.08\n\nOther industries (lumber, chemical and metallurgical industries) were not considered in this\ninventory since they didn’t operate in the year of reference.\n\nII.2.3 - Agricultural\n\n37\n\nII.2.3.1 - Enteric fermentation\n\nTable 19 presents the data used for estimating GHG emissions from enteric fermentation\ncaused by animals considered in this inventory.\n\nTable 19 - Livestock and emission factor\n\nTypes of Domestic\nAnimals\nNo. of Animals\nEmission factor (kg\n/ head / year)\nBovine non dairy cattle\n608,711\n 32\nOvine\n371,972\n5\nCaprine\n319,356\n5\nEquine\n2,000\n18\nAsinine\n5,000\n10\nPorcine\n41,814\n1\nBirds\n718,063\nNE\nNE - Not estimated\n\nThe number of animals contained in the table above were estimated using the average growth\nrate in the countries that are part of the Permanent Inter State Committee for the Struggle\nAgainst Drought in the Sahel (CILSS) with a pastoral type of cattle farming and purely extensive.\nThe emission factors considered were those proposed by the IPCC by default (1996).\n\nII.2.3.2 - Cultivated Soils\n\nThe following table gives us the national panorama in the inventory reference year of the types\nof fertilizers used and their respective emission factors.\n\nTable 20 - Types of fertilizers used and their respective emission factors\n\nType of Fertilizer\nincorporated into the soil\nAmount of N\nincorporated (KgN /\nyear)\nEmission factor for direct\nemissions of KgN 2ON /\nKgN\nChemical fertilizer (FSN)\n900,000\n0.0125\nManure (FAW)\n0\n0\nCultures without nitrogen\nfixation (BNF)\n120,000\n0.0125\nCrop residues (FCR)\n1,506,767.63\n0.0125\n\nThe above referenced data (type of fertilizer added to soil and the amount of N incorporated)\nwere taken from the manual of fertilizers from FAO (2003b) and emission factors considered\nwere those proposed by default by the IPCC (1996).\n\nII.2.3.3 - Rice Growing in Flooded areas\n\nTable 21 presents the data used for estimation of greenhouse gases from rice growing in\nflooded areas (bas-fonds and salty water rice fields).\n\nTable 21 - Data from surface rice cultivated in flooded areas and their respective factors (emission,\ncorrection of organic fertilizer and seasonal emission)\n\nWater management regime\nIrrigation - Intermittent flooding (bas-fonds\nand saltwater rice fields)\nCultivated area (1000 ha)\n41,669\nScale factor for CH4 emission\n0.5\nCorrection factor for organic fertilizer\n2.5\nSeasonal integrated emission factor for\nrice in permanent flooding without the use\n20\n\n38\n\nof organic fertilizer (g / m 2)\n\nThe data on areas of rice grown in flooded surface were obtained from the Division of\nAgricultural Statistics (DEA) and FAO (2003) and the scale factors, of correction and emissions\nwere taken by default (IPCC, 1996)\n\nII.2.3.4 - Savannah Burning for agricultural purposes\n\nThe following table contains data necessary for estimating GHG emissions from savannah\nburning for agricultural purposes.\n\nTable 22 - Data required for estimating GHG emissions from savannah burning\nfor agricultural purposes\n\nBurned Area (Kha)\nBiomass density of\nthe savanna (dmt /\nha)\nFraction actually\nburned\nFraction of biomass\nburned alive\n193.75\n3\n0.85\n0.8\n\nThe area burned was estimated based on the total area of savanna in the year of inventory,\nverified under the CARBOVEG-GB Project multiplied by the percentage of annual savanna\nburned for agricultural purposes-25% (communication of several national experts).

The forest\narea estimated in 2006, is approximately 2,072,000 ha the mangrove forest is 287,000 ha, and\nthe savannah woodland is 775,000 ha. The area of planted forest has been taken from FAO\n(2003) - Prospective Study of the Forestry Sector in Africa.\n\nThe value of the annual growth rate considered was proposed by Kaine (1999) in African\nDevelopment Bank. 2001, which is 4 ms ton / ha / year for natural forests since the country is in\nPhyto-geographically Guineo-Congolese/Sudanese Regional Transition Zone– Region XI of\nWhite (1981, 1983), and of 2 and 2.5 for the mangrove and wooded savanna IPCC (1996) since\nthe country is in a humid region with long dry seasons.\n\nAccording to FAO (2003), the annual loss of forest stands at 22,000 ha, i.e. 22 kha.

The area of planted forest has been taken from FAO (2003 c) )-\nProspective Study of the Forestry Sector in Africa.\n\nThe value of the annual growth rate considered was proposed by Kaine (1999) in African\nDevelopment Bank. 2001, which is 4 ms ton / ha / year for natural forests, since the country is\nphyto-geographically in the Guineo-Congoles/Sudanes Regional Transition Zone - Region XI\nWhite (1981, 1983), and 2 and 2.5 for the mangrove and wooded savanna IPCC (1996) since\nthe country is in a humid region with a long dry season.\n\nAccording to FAO (2003), the annual loss of forest stands at 22,000 ha, i.e. 22 kha. The amount\nof commercial timber exploited in a year’s inventory is 170x1000 m 3 and the total quantity of\nwood for energy production including the production of charcoal is 2,395 kton ms (FAO, 2003 c).)\nThe total amount of other uses of wood was void due to lack of information. The carbon fraction\nof dry matter has been considered a default value of 0.5 for all types of biomass, since there is\nno specific value (IPCC, 1996). The ratio under consideration is the expansion of logged forests.\nSequestration / net emission of carbon attributed sources referenced above is expressed in Gg\nCO 2.\n\nII.2.4.2 - Conversion of forests to other uses\n\nIn order to estimate emissions from deforestation (forest conversion for agriculture and related\nuses), it is necessary to have data from areas deforested annually and the net amount of\nbiomass by type of vegetation. According to the manual of the IPCC (1996), the difference\nbetween the existing biomass before and after cutting, i.e. the biomass of the crop installed in\nthe area, is reflected in the estimate of net biomass.\n\nEmissions of CO2 resulting from the conversion of forests are considered as immediate\nemissions in the year of conversion. The estimation of the change in stock biomass inventory in\nthe year and ten years before was because it was considered that the fraction of biomass that\nremains in the soil is degraded slowly over a 10 year period (IPCC, 1996). In this work, given the\ndifficulties of obtaining data, all the net CO2 conversion that occurred in the year, was assumed\nregardless of the fate of the biomass retained, i.e., all rusted carbon stock of the converted area\nwas considered in the year of the inventory.\n\n41\n\nTable 25 presents the data used to estimate the total annual loss of carbon from conversion of\nforests to other uses.\n\nTable 25 - Data used to estimate the total annual loss of carbon from conversion of forests to other uses\n\nVariable\nValues\nSource\nArea converted annually\n22 kha\nFAO (2003)\nLiving biomass above the ground before the\nconversion\n158 ms ton / ha\nPreliminary data Proj.\nCARBOVEG-GB\nLiving biomass above the soil after conversion\nMs 10 ton / ha\nIPCC (1996) default value\nFraction of biomass burned on site\n0.3\nIPCC (1996) default value\nFraction of biomass oxidized on site\n0.9\nIPCC (1996) default value\nCarbon fraction of aboveground biomass\nburned on site\n0.5\nIPCC (1996) default value\nFraction of biomass burned off-site\n0.1\nIPCC (1996) default value\nFraction of biomass oxidized off-site\n0.9\nIPCC (1996) default value\nFraction left to decay\n0.2\nIPCC (1996) default value\nFraction of carbon biomass above ground\nburnt off site\n0.5\nIPCC (1996) default value\n\nDue to lack of data, the values of fraction of biomass burned on and off site, fraction of biomass\noxidized on and off site, the carbon fraction of above-ground biomass burned on and off site, the\naverage annual coverage (10 years) fraction left to decompose and the carbon fraction of\nbiomass above ground was taken by default (IPCC, 1996).The living biomass above the soil\nafter conversion also includes a biomass powered on agricultural uses (10 ms ton / ha).\n\nThe area was converted annually based on data obtained from FAO (2003 c) and the value of\nliving biomass above the ground before the conversion was obtained through the preliminary\ndata of the CARBOVEG-GB Project. It was found that in recent times the loss of forest cover in\nGuinea-Bissau comes mainly from burning and clearing the cluttered forest to obtain arable land,\nespecially for the deployment of large areas of cultivation of cashew and the intensification of\ntraditional practice of shifting agriculture. Figure 7 presents a satellite image of Guinea-Bissau,\nwhere you can see the green and forest patches and in table # 26 variation of forest areas\nduring the last 26 years are presented.\n\nFigure 7 - Mosaic Satellite image of Guinea-Bissau\n\n42\n\nTable 26 - Wooded areas during the last 26 years\n\nYear\nOccupied\narea\n(Ha)\nSource\n1978\n2344950\nPANA (2006)\n1986\n2292000\nElaborated\n2006\n2072000\nPrelim Data. CARBOVEG Proj. projection and FAO (2007)\n\nLooking at Table 26, it appears that the overall area of forests in the country has been\ndecreasing over the years.\n\nII.2.4.3 - Combustion \"on site\" Forestry: Emissions of other non-CO 2 gases\n\nTable 27 presents the ratios of emission from open air burning forests.\n\nTable 27 - Ratios of emission from open air forests burning to, adap.

These calculations report on the size of abandoned lands and the\nduration of time that the lands have been abandoned:\n- Annual sequestration of carbon in above-ground biomass (land abandoned in the last 20 years\nand lands abandoned between 20 and 100 years). These values were then added to carbon\nsequestration and converted to CO 2 absorption.\n\nAccording to the difference in forest areas of the years 1978, 1986 and 2006 (2,344,950 ha,\n2,292,000 ha and 2,072,000 ha respectively) have been abandoned in the last 100 years,\n157,950 ha (273 kha) and 220 kha of forest in the last 20 years (table 12). The values of aboveground biomass, and the fraction of carbon are presented in Table 11.The value of average\nannual growth of 8, 2, 4, 2.5 ton of dry matter per hectare for planted forests, mangroves, natural\nforests and savanna were considered respectively (IPCC, 1996).\n\nII.2.4.5 - Issue and CO2 removal by soil\n\nIn this study it was found that all agriculture practiced in Guinea-Bissau is practically in organic\nsoils with high organic matter content and the presence of considerable bases of exchange.\nAccording to data from the DEA in 2006, there are 27,469 ha of bas-fonds, 14,200 fields of salty\nwater and 165,076 ha of plateau, for a total of 206,737 ha that are used for agriculture.\n\nConsidering the totality of farmland (206,737 ha) as being areas from forest conversion and\nassuming that these areas are covered by organic soils, and considering that these areas were\n\n43\n\nmaintained until the inventory base year (2006), we estimated CO 2 emissions resulting from\norganic soils. The emission factor of CO 2 from organic soils considered was 1.36 (IPCC, 1996).\n\nII.2.5 - Waste\n\nIn urban centers of the country every day amounts of garbage are discharged directly into the\nsoil and large water ways. A lot of the Guinean population still uses traditional outdoor toilets that\ndon’t even have simple ventilation, or any cleaning service for septic tanks.\n\nTable 28 presents the preliminary calculations resulting from the annual quantity of solid waste\ndeposited at the dump.\n\nTable 28 – Data taken from the urban population production and per-capita amount of solid waste\ndeposited solids of depositing waste at the dump.\n\nNumber of urban\npopulation depositing\nwaste at the dump\nPer-capita production of\nsolid wastes\nFraction of solid wastes\ndeposited in landfill\n744295\n00.29\n0.4\n\nThe number of urban population that deposited waste at the dump in the reference year was\nobtained through the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC). The per-capita\nproduction of solid waste was obtained from data estimated by the City Hall of Bissau (CMB)\nand the State Administrative Committees of the eight Regions. According to CMB, only a fraction\nof 40% of solid waste is deposited at the dump.\n\nII.2.5.1 - Solid Waste deposited at the dump\n\nThe emission of CH 4 from solid waste deposited at the dump was estimated based on data\ncontained in table 29.\n\nTable 29 - Data used to estimate the emission of CH 4 from solid waste deposited at the dump\n\nAnnual Quantity of Solid\nWaste Deposited (GgMSW)\nCH 4 Correction factor\nFraction of degradable\norganic matter\n31.51\n0.6\n00:11\n\nThe annual quantity of solid waste deposited at the dump was obtained by multiplying the\nnumber of population served by the treatment system for municipal solid waste per capita\nproduction of waste, 365 days a year. The correction factor of CH 4 and the fraction of\ndegradable organic matter under consideration were proposed by the IPCC (1996).\n\nII.2.5.2 - Wastewater and sludge\n\nThe CH 4 emitted from wastewater and sludge was estimated based as shown on the table that\nfollows.\n\nTable 30 - Data used for estimation of CH 4 emitted by wastewater and sludge\n\nPopulation (1,000 persons)\nDegradable Organic\nComposition (Kg CBO/1000\nperson / year)\nFraction of degradable\norganic composition\nremoved from the sludge\n521\n13505\n0\n\n44\n\nThe population of 1,000 was used for estimation when taking into account the fact that 70% of\nthe population lives in urban centers. According to the Multiple Indicator Survey (MIC) of 2006,\nheld by the State Secretariat of Planning, only 11.4% of this population have sanitary facilities\n(latrines and septic tanks). The degradable organic component was proposed by the IPCC in\n1996. The fraction of degradable organic component removed from the sludge was void\nbecause the country does not have any type of sludge treatment system (IPCC, 1996).\n\nGiven the fact that industrial units in the country are insignificant, CH4 emissions from industrial\nwastewater were not considered.\n\nII.2.5.3 - Human Droppings\n\nThe estimated emission of NO 2 from human waste was estimated taking into account the\nfollowing table.\n\nTable 31 - Consumption of protein, total population and proportion of nitrogen in protein\n\nProtein consumption (kg /\nperson / year)\nTotal population of country\nFraction of nitrogen in\nprotein (kg N / kg protein)\n1,7885\n1,357,244\n0.16\n\nThe per-capita consumption of protein was extracted from FAO (1994), since there are no recent\ndata. The number of total population in the reference year was obtained through the national\npopulation projection for the year in reference by INEC in 2006. The fraction of nitrogen in\nprotein was proposed by the IPCC (1996).\n\nII.3 - METHODOLOGY\n\nThe inventory of emissions of greenhouse gases in the Republic of Guinea Bissau was\nbased on the methodology of IPCC (1996) and the Manual of Good Practice for Land Use,\nLand-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) - (GCP, 2003), adapted to national circumstances. It\nwas conducted with the purpose of quantifying the emissions of carbon dioxide C02 and other\nnon CO 2 greenhouse gases from anthropogenic activities, taking the year 2000 as a reference.\n\nThe emission sources are ranked according to the UNFCCC-NAI scheduled program modules.\n\n Module 1 - Use of Energy (burning fossil fuel, biomass, air transport, business\nsectors / households);\n Module 2 - Industry\n Module 4 – Agriculture and livestock;\n Module 5 and 5B – Changes in Land and Forestry Use;\n Module 6 - Final Disposal of Solid Waste and Domestic Wastewater Treatment and\nCommercial and Industrial Effluents\n\nIn the energy sector the methodology proposed by the IPCC (1996) calls for estimation of GHG\nemissions in stages, considering:\nEstimation of apparent consumption of fuel, expressed in units of origin; Conversion into\ncommon energy units, multiplication by the emission factor for estimating the carbon content;\nEstimation of carbon stocks; correction taking into account the incomplete combustion and\nconversion of oxidized carbon emissions of CO2.\n\n45\n\nAccording to the IPCC (1996), in order to estimate the amount of fuel in the country in the\nenergy sector, it is necessary to have data for each type of fuel for the reference year.\n\nIn the estimation of apparent consumption of fuels expressed in original units, the recommended\nmethodology to estimate the country's supply of carbon for each fuel type. Data on primary fuels\n(production, import, export, international supply and change in stocks should be introduced). For\nsecondary fuels and derivative by-products, data should be entered for import, export,\ninternational supply and variation of stocks. This data allows for the estimation of overall\nconsumption. Apparent consumption can be obtained using the following formula:\n\nApparent Consumption = Production + Import-Export- International Supply -Variation in Stocks\n\nThe conversion of common energy units (TJ) is obtained by entering the conversion factor used\nfor each type of fuel and multiplying it by apparent consumption (PCI or scale factor), thus\nobtaining the value of apparent consumption in TJ\n\nThe multiplication factors for carbon emission is obtained by entering the emission factors of\ncarbon (SCC), which should be used to convert the apparent consumption in quantity (content)\nof carbon. Then the apparent consumption is expressed in TJ, multiplied by the emission of\ncarbon, to obtain the amount (content) of carbon in tons of carbon (tC).The amount of carbon\nobtained was converted into Giga grams (Gg) of carbon. Thus it was possible to estimate the\ncorresponding sub-categories of total liquid fuels, solid, gaseous and solid biomass (fire wood\nand coal).\n\nIn order to estimate carbon stored and not stored is done by estimating the amount of stored\ncarbon, i.e., estimate the amount of fuels that are used as alimenting product supply for energy\npurposes. Then the units were converted into common energy units (TJ). We calculated the\nactual amount of carbon stored. Subsequently we estimated the carbon that was not stored.\n\nThe conversion of CO2 was carried out by multiplying the actual emissions of carbon by 44/12 to\nobtain the total CO2 emitted during the combustion process.\n\nRegarding the industrial sector, according to the methodology (IPCC, 1996) in order to\nestimate the emissions from bakeries producing bread and distilleries producing alcoholic\nbeverages is done based on the overall annual output of the manufacturing process of a\nparticular food and drink.\n\nFor the estimation of NMVOC emissions from the production of bread and cashew nut\nprocessing, we first evaluated the total quantity of food produced in tons by category of food\nmanufacturing processes. We considered the corresponding emissions factors. The product of\nthe total quantity of food (bread and cashew nuts) and their emission factors shows the emission\nof NMVOC. The final result is shown in Gg of NMVOC.\n\nAccording to the IPCC Manual (1996), to estimate the emissions of NMVOC from production of\nalcoholic beverages and spirits, it is necessary to evaluate the total quantity of alcoholic\nbeverages produced in hectoliters (hl), with a breakdown by category of drinks. You must also\nhave the corresponding emission factors in kg of NMVOC per hectoliter of produced beverage.\nThe emission of NMVOC is translated by the product of the total annual quantity of alcoholic\nbeverages and their emission factors. The final result is shown in Gg of NMVOC.\n\nIn the agricultural and livestock sector we considered GHG emissions from enteric\nfermentation, emissions from land actually farmed, emissions attributed to rice cultivation,\nburning of grasslands for agricultural purposes and in situ burning of agricultural waste.\n\n46\n\nThe total emission of CH4 was calculated by the sum of emissions for each livestock. The IPCC\nmethodology (1996) recommends multiplying the number of livestock in each species by an\nemission factor, taking into account climatic conditions and management of herds in the country.\nIn this study the animals which were studied were: cows, pigs, horses, goats, sheep, donkeys\nand poultry.\n\nThe dung management was not considered in this study since the extensive production system\npracticed in the country does not allow for its management control.\n\nAs for N2O emissions from soils farmed, we only used the step of estimating direct emissions of\nN2O resulting from the incorporation of nitrogen in the soil.\n\nIn forestry, the methodology calls for the emission and absorption of CO2 from changes in uses\nof land and forestry fall mainly into five categories of activities: development of biomass stocks in\nforests and other woody formations, conversion of forests and grasslands for other uses; \"on\nsite” combustion of forests; abandonment of land farmed (Cropped natural regeneration of land,\npastures or other land farmed) and the issuance and removal of CO2 by the soil.\n\nIn the category of Evolution / Change of biomass stocks in forests and other woody formations,\ncarbon emissions and removals (and CO 2) arising from the development of forest resources\nand other woody biomass stocks under the influence of human activities were estimated.\nAccording to the IPCC Manual (1996), to estimate the net sequestration of CO 2 arising in this\ncategory, one must estimate the changes of biomass of planted forests from the wilderness to\nindustrial exploitation. Thus, as the country has virtually no significant commercial exploitation of\nplanted forests (N'Bunhe) they were treated the same way as natural forests.\n\nIn addition to the methods already mentioned above, the Manual also includes trees that grow in\nurban areas. Keeping track of these trees planted, (per 1,000 trees), knowing the annual growth\nrate of species planted in tons of dry matter per hectare per tree (dry matter ton / ha / tree)\nallowed for the estimation the annual increment of biomass per acre or the number of trees.\nGiven the lack of data regarding the trees planted in urban areas, we were unable to estimate\nthe removal of CO 2 resulting from it.\n\nIn the category of forest conversion to other uses in order to obtain estimates of CO 2 resulting\nfrom the conversion of forests / grasslands, we used three sets of calculations:\n\n1 - CO 2 emitted from burning biomass crops (immediate issue that occurs during conversion);\n\n2 - CO 2 released by the decomposition of above-ground biomass (issued for a period of 10\nyears);\n\n3 - CO 2 released from the soil.\n\nIn the category of combustion \"on site\" of forests: Emissions of other gases non-CO 2\n(CH 4, N 2 O, CO and NOX), the emissions of CH 4 and CO were estimated under the form of ratio\nto the flow of carbon emitted during combustion. The total nitrogen was estimated based on the\nnitrogen / carbon. Emissions of N2O and NO x were estimated in the form of ratio to total\nnitrogen.\n\nIn the category of abandoned farm land (natural regeneration of farm land, pastures or other\nland farmed), it was considered that carbon accumulation in abandoned land largely depends on\nthe type of natural ecosystem in which these lands are abandoned, since the land they farm are\nabandoned, or carbon cannot be accumulated in the soil, depending on several factors.\n\n47\n\nIn the category of emission and removal of CO 2 by soils, we estimated the net CO 2 (carbon\nsinks and sources) from the three processes: 1) modification of carbon stored in the soil due to\nthe practice of land use, 2) CO 2 emissions resulting from organic soils converted to farmland or\nplantations and 3) CO 2 emissions from lime application on agricultural soils. The carbon stored\nin soil was estimated in the upper area of land situated at a 30 cm depth.\n\nThe calculations of CO 2 emissions from mineral soils were based on changes in allocation of\nland and farm management practices. The calculation of changes in carbon stocks requires an\ninventory period corresponding to 20 years. The estimation of allocation system for allocating\nland for different soil types is done at present, i.e. in the year of inventory and for a period equal\nto 20 years earlier. In this work we have assumed that the net changes of carbon from dead\ntrees, the litter and soil minerals are zero (0).\n\nThe calculations of CO 2 from the organic soils are conducted using annual estimates.\n\nConcerning waste, the IPCC (1996) recommends:\n\n1 - Estimates of the emission of methane from solid waste deposited in the dumps;\n\n2 - Methane emissions from domestic wastewater treatment and industrial products;\n\n3 - Emissions of nitrogen oxide from human waste.\n\nFor estimating the emission of methane from solid waste deposited at the dump, it was important\nto take into account the urban population served by waste collection, the amount of waste\ndeposited at the dump, and the fraction of degradable organic carbon. It also appealed to the\nmethod of decomposition of the first order (DFO). The methane from the decomposition of\norganic matter in anaerobic conditions, of which some is produced and oxidized on the surface\nof the deposit and thus can still be recovered for energy purposes.\n\nWith regard to emission of methane from domestic waste-water treatment, we used the default\nestimation method proposed by IPCC's Manual (1996) for lack of data, mainly due to lack of\ntreatment technology industry. For industrial wastewater, we used estimations of domestic\nwastewater obtained by default in the Manual mentioned above. For the quality of bread and\nalcohol drinks, data were extracted from the report of the industrial processes.\n\nThe emission of nitrogen oxide from human waste was estimated using the estimation of indirect\nemissions from wastewater or water environments, using the total number of population and per\ncapita consumption of protein at the country level.\n\nII.4 - SUMMARY OF EMISSIONS\n\nThe following table shows a summary of GHG emissions in the sectors concerned.\n\nTable 32: Summary of GHG emissions in the Energy, Industry, Agriculture sectors, change in Forestry\nand Waste land use in the Republic of Guinea-Bissau during the year 2006.\n\n48\n\nSectors\nSubsectors\nCH 4 (Gg)\nCO (Gg)\nN 2 0 (Gg)\nEnergy\n\n3.79\n106.02\n00:02\nIndustry\nBakery\n-\n-\n-\nCashew nut processing.\n-\n-\n-\n\nBrandy\n-\n-\n-\nWine\n-\n-\n-\nFarming\nEnteric fermentation\n23.93\n-\n-\nSoils farmed\n-\n-\n2.21\nRice\n10:42\n-\n-\nBurning of savannas for agricultural\npurposes\n0.97\n25.45\n00:12\nIn situ burning of agricultural waste\n5.20\n109.17\n00:14\nChange in use of forests and\nsoils\n\n61.45\n7:03\n1.75\nWaste\nSolids\n1:07\n-\n-\nWastewater and sludge\n0.67\n-\n12:00\nIndustrial waste water\n12:03\n-\n-\nTotal\n\n107.53\n247.67\n4.24\n\n49\n\nIII – CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY\n\nVulnerability means the degree of inability of a system to cope with the adverse effects of\nclimate changes that are taking place because of variations in climate, the degree of\nresponsiveness to these changes and its adaptive capacity. Numerous factors are involved,\ntherefore, in its assessment, which implies an accumulation of uncertainties of various\norigins. The information concerning the impact of climate change in Guinea-Bissau is\nembryonic, due to limited data available.\n\nAlthough the incidence studies do not systematically support climate change scenarios, it is\nnecessary to have general information about the evolution of climate projections adapted to\nthe country.\n\nIII.1 - CLIMATIC RISKS IN GUINEA-BISSAU\n\nDuring the consultation process of the populations for the elaboration of PANA, there have\nbeen frequent assertions by witnesses on the change of parameters related to rainfall,\ntemperature, relative humidity, sea level and quantity of water resources. People have noted\n(i) a late onset of the rainy season (mid-June) compared to the usual (early May); (ii) a less\nregular distribution of rainfall than in the past; (iii) a shortening of the mild temperatures\nperiod, often called the \"cold season” (Guinea-Bissau version of “winter)\", with a duration of\nthree months (December to February), now reduced to only two months (December to\nJanuary); (iv) a warmer and drier environment; (v) frequent vacant dust clouds; (vi) more\nfrequent occurrence of high-tides of greater magnitudes destroying dikes and rice fields; (vii)\na decrease in water quality by saline water intrusion and water point infestation by aquatic\nplants; (viii ) reduction of the wetland areas and resentment due to drought.\n\nThe evolution of rainfall over the past 30 years (1961-1990), or even in the last 45 years\n(1954-2000) shows a downward trend and irregular rainfall, based on observed variations: in\nthe South, 2440-1800 mm; Mid-Country, 2,200 to 1,600 mm and the North, 1,600 to 1,200\nmm, according to C. Silva quoted by A. O. da Silva (2001). For the period 1953-1983, a\nstudy would reveal that while in the North, on the border with Senegal, in just over 70 days,\nthe average rainfall was 1,300 mm, as at the deep South end of the country it was more than\n3,000 mm in more than 120 days of rain.\n\nFor the period 1961-1990 (Imbali, F. and Silva, A. 1997), the average rainfall recorded was\n162 days. In fact, there is currently a decrease in rainfall to only five months of the year\n(June to October), contrary to previous years (May to November). This is reflected in the\nscarcity of water, whose consequences are felt in the production of rice in small valleys and\nin cultures of upland rice and other cereals. Currently, the rains are always accompanied by\nstrong winds especially in the months of August and September. The loss of production of\ncereal crops during this time is high. In the lowlands, bas-fond, flood damage can be\nsignificant, as well in the rice fields implanted in hydromorphic colonized mangrove lowlands.\n\nIn this ecosystem, with recent rises in average sea levels, there have been invasions of tides\ninto the rice fields, resulting in the destruction of dikes and consequently loss of productive\ncapacity of land for rice cultivation. In the South, Mid-Country and the Islands, with\nproductions that require more water such as rice and corn, in addition to the negative\nphenomena that are related to the concentration of poor rainfall and its temporal distribution.\n\nThe reflections of other climatic parameters such as temperature, above flood level caused\nby the presence of semi-diurnal waves, whose amplitudes are among the highest in West\nAfrica, particularly in Portogole and Buba, where they reach six meters, forty-two millimeters\n(6.42 m) in height.\n\n50\n\nOther examples are known to range from 1.97 m for Farim, 4.24 for Bubaque, 3.61 m for\nPecixe, 5.10 m for Bissau, 4.90 m for Bolama and 2.32 m for Varela (BARUSSEAU et al.,\ncited by SILVA, A.O. (2001). With almost two thirds of the territory situated on the coastal\nzone, which does not exceed the level curve of 50 meters, Guinea-Bissau is a country at the\nmercy of high tides and coastal erosion. The impacts are being felt, with a devastating form\nin coastal areas, on farmland and coastal ecosystems. This has been exacerbated by\nclimate change (prolongation of the dry season increasing the temperature in the sea).\nIndeed, it is believed that the effects of erosion may determine the decrease of the total area\nof the country from its present size of 36,125 m2 today to 28,000 km² in the future (1st\nCNSMC, 2004).\n\nAccording to historical findings (Directorate General of Water Services), floods in the coastal\nzone, caused by high tides, torrential rain or (as was observed in the years 2003, 2004 and\n2005), affected regions in East of the country (Bafata and Gabu ). This phenomenon has\ncaused damage to infrastructure (bridges and substandard housing), loss of 63 hectares of\nfood crops and inconvenience for the hundreds of people who have been forced to abandon\ntheir villages, both temporarily and permanently. The sources of the floods would come\nmainly from the tributaries of the Geba River and the shared tributaries of Koliba Rivers\n(Guinea-Conakry) and Corubal (Guinea-Bissau).\n\nIn 2005, five communities in the Bedanda / Cubucaré Sector loss their cultivated rice paddy\nfields due to the intrusion of salt water resulting from high tides in September, which\ndestroyed the levees for protection. According to the evaluation of rural engineering\nservices, 3,015 ha are no longer usable for Rice culture.\n\nIn what are known as mangrove soils and in some of the small valleys, inadequate and poor\ndistribution of rainfall has provoked the rising levels of salinity and soil acidity making them\nunfit for rice cultivation. As a consequence the number of cases of abandonment of these\npaddies has increased. As an example the case of five villages in Cubucaré in the South of\nthe country, where the population were prevented from cultivating 3,015 hectares of fields\ndue to destruction of their dikes, and the resulting loss of cultivated rice fields. This was\ncaused by burns caused by the penetration of salt water in the cultivated plots. In their\nsearch for new land, most rice farmers will resort to clearing and burning forests to install\ntheir new rice fields. Another consequence is the migration of farmers from the South Coast\nto the North part of the Republic of Guinea. In the East, the Northeast and some parts of the\nSouth - the Regions most affected by deterioration from rain - also recorded migrations from\nthe highlands to the lowlands (small valleys) or vice versa.\n\nIn the East, sand coming from the Sahara Desert, along with drought and temperature\nincreases may enhance the effect on cereal crops, mainly maize corn, horse millet and\nsorghum.\n\nThe rains, when concentrated during very short period of the year, have reduced agricultural\nactivities to only once a year, reducing the availability of waste and by-products of agriculture\nneeded to feed livestock. The decrease in natural pastures as a result of reduced rainfall, will\nlead to the overuse of pastures which, in turn, contribute to the destruction of herbaceous\nvegetation and promote the development of dry bushes.\n\nPeriods of prolonged drought, accompanied by increased temperature and drought periods,\nmodification or degradation of vegetation, give rise to changes in the composition of most\nforest species, or even extinction of some species of plants and animal migrations (PANA,\n2006).\n\nData from the three parameters (temperature, rainfall and flow) demonstrate the vulnerability\nof water resources in the Eastern Province (Figure 3). The temperature in the Region of\nBafata increased by about 0.3 º C during the periods of 1961-2003, precipitation fell as much\n\n51\n\nin Bafata as in Gabu, during the periods (1961-2007). Flow rates decreased, i.e., there was\nregression in the flow of the river due to low rainfall areas of the Kaianga-Geba River\nsystem, and the infrastructure construction of water retention in its upstream part, Senegal.\nFigure #8 shows the variations of parameters (temperature, rainfall and flow) in the east of\nthe country.\n\nIf we take into account the scenarios of increased temperature and decreased precipitation\n(according to the projected scenarios of climate in Guinea-Bissau for the time being), there\nwill be a worsening of the adverse impacts associated with its decline, both in terms of water\nresources on the surface and in terms of aquifers. These impacts will result in a reduction in\nagricultural production, the decrease in pasture area and the increased rural exodus.\n\nAccording to the 1st CNSMC (2004), the climatic parameter that most affects the water\nsector is rainfall, bearing in mind that there was a decrease of around 10% in the coastal\narea and 15% inland, on the average, between the periods from 1941-1969 and from 1970.\nThis decrease has adversely affected the recharge of shallower aquifers unconfined on the\none hand, and the debit of the rivers on the other, thus favoring the progression of saline.\nThe study conducted in the Corubal River basin demonstrated that there is a direct\nrelationship between rainfall and runoff of rainwater, if one decreases, as shown in Figure 9,\ndrawn from data collected during 16 years of observation between 1957/58 and 1986/87,\nexcept for the period between 1963/64 and 1976/77.\n\nFigure 8: Variations of parameters (temperature, rainfall and flow) in the East of the country.\n\nNote: Figure 8 illustrates the changes in annual temperatures in Bafata in the period 1961-2001, the\nfigure 8a) shows the variations in annual rainfall in the period 1961-2007 Bafatá; Figure 8b) shows\nthe variations of rainfall in Gabu during the annual period of 1961-2007, the figure 3c) illustrates the\nvariations in the flow-stations Sonaco Aval in the period 1980-1993.\n\nEvolução das Temeperaturas medias anuais da Estação Meteorologica de Bafata (Periodo: 19612001)\n24,5\n25\n25,5\n26\n26,5\n27\n27,5\n28\n28,5\n1961\n1963\n1965\n1967\n1969\n1971\n1973\n1975\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\nAnos\nTemperaturas (em °C)\nSérie2\nLinéaire (Série2)\n\nEvolução das Chuvas de Bafatá (periodo: 1061 - 2007)\ny = -4,603x + 1419,5\nR2 = 0,074\n0,0\n500,0\n1000,0\n1500,0\n2000,0\n2500,0\n1961\n1963\n1965\n1967\n1969\n1971\n1973\n1975\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\nAnos\nPrecipitações(mm) mm\n\nA\nb\nEvolução das Chuvas em Gabu (periodo 1961 - 2007)\ny = -1,5678x + 1293,1\nR2 = 0,0096\n0,0\n500,0\n1000,0\n1500,0\n2000,0\n2500,0\n1961\n1963\n1965\n1967\n1969\n1971\n1973\n1975\n1977\n1979\n1981\n1983\n1985\n1987\n1989\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\nAnos\nPricipitações (mm)mm\n\nEvolução dos Caudais da Estação de Sonaco-Aval (periodo: 1980-1993)\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n1980\n1981\n1982\n1983\n1984\n1985\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\nAnos\nCaudais em m3/s\nSérie2\nLinéaire (Série2)\n\nC\nd\n\n52\n\nFigure 9: Value rainfall-runoff.\n\nPeriod of Observation\n\nOther effects of climate change on water resources include the reduction of vegetation\ncover, desertification, increased evaporation and evapo-transpiration, soil erosion and soil\nloss. The decrease in water availability associated with changes in temperature, will also\nthreaten the biodiversity of terrestrial Guinea-Bissau and their specifics.\n\nWith regard to public health, energy will assist the spread of diseases sensitive to climate.\nThe increase of temperature and humidity causes an increase in malaria transmission. The\noccurrence of flooding will encourage the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera\nand other diarrheal diseases. Moreover, drought increases the potential existence of\nmeningitis, which causes the emergence of infections and epidemics. Warming worsens air\npollution and consequently increases the risks of acute respiratory illnesses.\n\nRestricted access to water and sanitation aggravates malnutrition. Extreme weather events\nsuch as storms, floods and droughts, contribute to a movement of the social fabric which in\nturn has consequences such as the lack of shelters for the sick, widespread malnutrition and\nshortages of drinking water.\n\nIII.2 - CLIMATIC SCENARIOS\n\nAll models of future climate changes, implemented under the National Communications (the\nfirst and second, currently in preparation) and slated to provide weather variability. Thus,\nunder the Second National Communication (Profile of Guinea-Bissau Climate), with\nreference to the normal climate (1961-1990), is expected to increase average temperature in\nthe order of 0.98 ° C for the IPCC-A2 scenario ( high emissions), and 0.96 ° C for the IPCCB2 scenario (low emissions) for the 2020 time horizon (2010-2039).This means that even\nwith maintaining the current level of emissions, warming will be in the order of about +1 ° C\ncompared to normal climatic considered. With regard to precipitation, the uncertainty of\nfuture climate is significantly higher. However, almost all models predict a rise in precipitation\nthat could be, on the average, 3.80% for the A2 scenario (high emissions); 3.71% for\nScenario B2 (low emissions), but the Model CSIRO (Australian), which provides a decrease\nin precipitation in the order of -1.81% for the A2 scenario (high emissions) and -1.88% for\nScenario B2 (low emissions) is the exception. This scenario is known as Scenario A. In the\nfigures #10 and #11 shows the illustrations of projected climate scenarios.\n\nAs regards the time horizon of 2050 (2040-2069), all models in all scenarios foresee an\nincrease in average temperature in the order of 1.95 ° C for the IPCC-A2 scenario (high\nemissions) and 1,77 ° C for the IPCC-B2 scenario (Low emissions) compared to the average\n\n53\n\n1961-1990. This increase would achieve 3.3 ° C, if we take into account the A1FI scenario\n(use of fossil fuels). For rainfall, almost all global circulation models, regionalized, point to an\nincrease in precipitation higher than the average 1961-1990 (Normal), for the West African\nRegion, where Guinea-Bissau is inserted. All Multi-models provide, on average, a likely\nincrease in the order of 3.84% for the A2 scenario (High emissions) and the order of 3.40%\nfor Scenario B2 (low emissions). The exception is made to the CSIRO model that provides\nfor a decrease in precipitation, on the average, to the order of -3.54% for the A2 scenario\n(high emissions) and the order of -3.34% for Scenario B2 (low emissions).This scenario is\nknown as Scenario B.\n\nFigure 10: Climate change, temperature (° C) and projected rainfall (mm) for the period of 2020\n(2010-2039): a) Scenario A2 (high emissions for temperature), b) Scenario A2 (high emissions for\nrainfall), c) Scenario B2 (Low emissions for temperature) and d) Scenario B2 (low emissions for\nprecipitation), Multi-models (ECHAM4, HADCM3, NCAR_PCM, CGCM2, GFDL-R30).\n\na\nb\nc\nd\nFigure 11: Climate change, temperature (° C) and projected rainfall (mm) for the period from 2050\n(2040-2069), a) Scenario A2 (high emissions for temperature), b) Scenario A2 (high emissions for\nrainfall), c) Scenario B2 (low emissions for temperature), d) Scenario B2 (low emissions for\nprecipitation), Multi-models (ECHAM4, HADCM3, NCAR_PCM, CGCM2, GFDL-R30).\n\n54\n\nIII. 3 - METHODOLOGY\n\nFor lack of data to feed the models proposed by the IPCC, we used the top-down\nmethodology for assessing vulnerability, with the exception of the forestry sector that was\nused in the Holdridge Model.\n\nThe Holdridge model was recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) and is considered the most suitable for the simulation of impacts on forestry.\n\nIt is worth noting that, apart from the climatic factor, another factor which determines the\ndistribution of forests is the human factor. It is assumed that if you do not register a sudden\nchange in current arrangements for land use in these areas, it is likely that the distribution of\nforests is similar to present, so the timelines chosen (20 and 50 years), unless we register\nany extreme events such as natural disasters or the impact of climate change in the future.\n\nThus, it was perceived that it was very pertinent to study the impacts of climate change on\nforests existing in the country in two aspects:\n\n1 - Possible changes in the geographical distribution of forests;\n2 - The impact of climate change on the stock and the ability of carbon sequestration in\nselected areas.\n\nAs regards the first aspect, we tried to ascertain what are the areas that may no longer have\nthe minimum environmental conditions for forest survival, that is, for the survival of some\nspecies of economic importance. To this end we used the Holdridge Model, taking into\naccount the Climate Scenarios for the interval 2020 to 2050.\n\na\nb\n\nc\nd\n\n55\n\nHoldridge in 1947 produced a graphic scheme that, through simple climatic data, could\ndetermine the vegetation formations in the world. In 1967, based on a 1947 map, we\nprepared the diagram called Life Zone, which used bio-temperature, precipitation and\nhumidity as variables to determine the vegetation formations.\n\nThe Life Zones are defined as a group of plant associations within a natural division of the\nclimate, which have a similar physiognomy common in the world. This Holdridge Model\n(1967) establishes a quantitative relationship between the main parameters of the macro\nclimate and physiognomic characteristics of most important natural vegetation climax.\nDiagram (Figure 12) is formed by lines that represent, in logarithmic scale, the interaction of\nindependent variables, bio-temperature and precipitation as well as the dependent variable\nof ambient humidity (ETP / P relation).\n\nFigure 12: Holdridge Life Zone Classification Model.\n\nThe second issue is of extreme importance in the context of the Kyoto Protocol, in which the\nchanges in carbon stocks should be accounted for in the carbon balance at the national\nlevel, given that deforestation contributes to emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Still,\naccording to this Protocol, countries may account, in their national inventories, carbon\nsequestration done through the creation of new forests and other changes that are recorded\nin land use.\n\nCurrent Distribution of Forests\nFigure 13 shows the current distribution of forests in Guinea-Bissau. This map was obtained\nafter the processing of satellite images from the CARBOVEG-GB Project.\n\nCurrent Stock of Carbon\nAccording to the inventory data collected in the field, particularly in the mainland, under the\nCARBOVEG-GB Project, after its preliminary processing through the use of biometric\ntemplates, the following four stocks of carbon in forest vegetation classes in Guinea-Bissau\nwere obtained: dense forest, open woodland, savannah woodland and mangrove, as shown\nin table 33.\n\n~\n\n56\n\nFigure 13: Distribution of existing forests in Guinea-Bissau.\n\nTable 33: Live biomass above ground and tons of carbon per hectare in the classes of\nforest vegetation considered.\n\nClasses covered\nLBAG (Ton / ha)\nTon C / ha\nDense forest\n186.26\n93.13\nOpen forest\n120.64\n60.32\nSavanna woodland\n27.68\n13.84\nMangrove\n23.82\n11.91\n\nIII.4 - ANALYSIS OF VULNERABILITY\n\nA vulnerability analysis was based on scenarios for horizons 2020 (Scenario A) and 2050\n(Scenario B).\n\nAccording to Scenario A, the following are effects of climate change in Guinea-Bissau:\n\n1. With increasing temperature the emergence of acidification phenomena and salinity\nof rivers and small valleys - that can lead to certain diseases and pests harmful to\ncrops in the dry season. Fire will spread in the highlands, with rising temperatures,\nwhich can cause serious problems. The study highlights the changing composition of\nforest trees in favor of the species most resistant to drought and fire, as well as the\nintensification of the least forested savannah areas.\n\n\nWith increased rainfall, degraded soils in disturbed areas will become even\nmore pronounced, being larger in the deforested land, i.e., without vegetation.\nIn these circumstances, the higher the rainfall, the greater the soil erosion and\nthe rise in the latria surface layer.\n\n\nThere will be a lot of vulnerabilities for Cattle, because with temperature\nincreases, along with the evaporation on the surfaces of rivers, basins and\nvalleys, it will force the decrease of water volume in during the period when\nwater needs for cattle and small ruminants increase. Rising temperatures\ncould force:\n\n Decrease of pasture surface;\n Increased anxiety for water consumption by animals;\n The trend for transhumance in search of land for pastures;\n\n57\n\n The emergence of diseases caused by malnutrition.\n\nWith expected increased rainfall, it will cause the following situations\nin agriculture:\n Prolonged flooding, which may reflect poor or delayed harvest;\n Deposition of organic materials from the plateau in bas-fonds, valleys and\nrivers, which could cause erosion and siltation of water;\n\nFor cattle, there will most likely be a of loss of pasture areas arising\ndue to flooding of the valleys and rivers; difficulties of transhumance\ndue to crossing the flooded areas, the emergence of herbs harmful to\nanimal health, onset of respiratory illness caused by excess moisture\nin the stables and barns.\n\n\nThe potential for tourism and coastal fisheries are strongly influenced\nby climatic factors such as temperature, rainfall and sea level, where\nchanges affect the vulnerability and adaptation to climate change at\nthe level of the entire coastal zone.\n\n\nThe existing poor infrastructure in the coastal zone may disappear.\nCoastal erosion will increase sharply and the phenomenon of floods\nmay increase, as shown in Figure 14.\n\nFigure 14: Illustration of climate change impacts on the coastal area. A) Erosion in\nVarela; b) erosion in Bubaque; and c) the risks of flooding in Bissau.\n\na\nb\nc\n\n2.Under Scenario B it is predicted that:\n\n\nThat increased temperature will have the same impact, as described\nin Scenario A. The decrease in precipitation may cause serious\nproblems in agriculture, for example, difficulties in the practice of\nagriculture due to water scarcity, which can also influence the\nmaturation of plants during critical periods. Insufficient water can result\nin the reduction of farm income, especially in the cultivation of cereals,\nwhich are staple foods for the population. The agricultural calendar\nmay be dysfunctional due to uncertainties in rainfall, which are\naccentuated at the beginning and end of the Rainy Season and its\ndistribution throughout the growing season and crop development;\n\n58\n\n\nIncreasing the period of transhumance of livestock in search of water\npoints and pasture, and possible social conflict between the ranchers\nand farmers.\n\n\nIn reference to water, impacts on the biophysical level, i.e., the\namount and quality of freshwater, such as changes in its temperature\nand its oxygen content, the increase in evapo-transpiration of\nfreshwater flows, lowering flow in the Corubal River and its tributaries,\nthe proliferation of aquatic plants in the river due to poor drainage - all\nof which could seriously compromise the fishing industry and lead to\ndecreasing levels of groundwater recharge.\n\n\nThe biophysical impacts noted above, in turn, engender in cascades,\nsocio-economic impacts, such as rural exodus caused by the\ndecrease in rainfall and the consequent decline in agricultural\nproductivity, increasing water demand, caused by a combination of\ntemperature factors and rural exodus.\n\n\nThat the biophysical impacts, with all its hardships, can make different\nsocial groups (women, children and the elderly, farmers, pastoralists,\nfishermen, gardeners, etc...), extremely vulnerable.\n\nThe country has faced, in recent times, a period of climatic disturbances with negative\neffects on agriculture and food production. Increasingly, the situation worsens and the\neffects are felt in the degradation of different production systems, particularly in the Southern\nRegions of Quinara and Tombali, the Northern Regions of Oio and Cacheu, and in the East,\nparticularly in the Sectors and Pitche and Pirada. The irregular rainfall, floods and pests do\nnot allow the crops to close their growing cycle, which therefore has a negative effect on\noverall production in the country. Consequently, food shortages will be frequent and serious,\nand will be even more so if the climatic phenomenon increases prices of agricultural\nproducts worldwide.\n\nThe flow of the Saltinho and Geba River basins, due to their crossing-borders, not only\ndepends on rainfall that occurs in our territory, but also occurring in countries through which\nthey pass. The decrease in rainfall has not been very significant, with the trend not having\nchanged much in the last 50 years (1954-2000), with average annual rainfall of around 2,200\nmm, and strong inter-annual variations. In this vein, the current status of watercourses in\nGuinea-Bissau could be characterized still by small variations of rainfall and evaporation\nreferred to above. Indeed, the decrease in rainfall results in a progressive decrease of water\nreserves, which is exacerbated by water shortages that takes place over the months of the\nrainy season, and by poor rainfall that takes place in the beginning of it.\n\nThe impacts that can be seen in humid zones of the Continent is the late start and early end\nof the Rainy Season and that has consequences on the surface reduction of wetlands by not\nfilling these up with rain water, causing a low amount of water being stored during the entire\nrainy period It dries up quickly by evaporation and is used quickly by animals in general.\n\nOne of the most visible changes in climate (rainfall), in the rivers is the proliferation of\naquatic plants. This is conditioned by the runoff into rivers, and there is a higher incidence in\nthe Geba River (East of the country).\n\n59\n\nIV - CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION\n\nIV.1 - ASSESSMENT OF ADAPTATION\n\nThe evaluation of adjustment is considered as an estimation of the ability of specific groups\nof systems ability to adapt to specific types of risks. In this document, there was no\nassessment as such, but an examination of current and future vulnerabilities faced with\nclimate change scenarios in order to propose strategies for adaptation. The system is\nunderstood, in this work as an economic sector in relation to population. Risks are defined\nphysically, for example, a drought, a storm or excessive rainfall. Thus, two approaches were\nused to propose adaptation strategies.\n\nThe first approach used was during the preparation of the Guinea-Bissau National Program\nof Action for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA). Indeed, during the preparation of PANA,\na study was undertaken to determine climate changes and variability observed. The study of\nGuinea-Bissau climatic profile of is one example. Thus, from the lessons learned from this\nstudy and based on traditional know-how, some strategies for adapting to climate change\nwere outlined.\n\nIV.2 - STRATEGIES AND MEANS OF ADAPTATIONS\n\nAs a contingency plan for the agricultural and rural sector, two major strategies have been\ndetermined by the Government:\n\nAn emergency strategy of supplying seeds and pesticides, to\ncompensate for the current food shortages caused by climate\nchange.\n\n\nAn investment strategy and support of capacity building for\nfarmers and their organizations, assisting them in recovery or\nrehabilitation of agricultural production bases, irrigation projects for\nbetter water management.\n\nThe investment strategy for the agricultural sector has resulted not only in the formulation of\nthe Agricultural Development Policy Charter and its Action Plan, approved in 1988 and\nupdated in 2002, but also in the formulation of the Medium Term National Investment\nProgram (PNIMP) and the National Program for Food Security (PNSA). However, with the\nexception of interventions made in connection with specific projects from time to time, policy\nletters and other documents unfortunately remain without effective enforcement and lack of\nfinancial resources.\n\nThe formulation of the National Investment Fund (PNIA) is on-going and will have the\nfollowing six priority areas of intervention:\n\ni) Improved water management (through the promotion of irrigation and\nintegrated water resources management).\nii)\n\nSustainable\ndevelopment\nof\nagriculture\n(components:\nIntegrated\nmanagement and soil fertility, strengthening of support services to producers and\ndissemination of improved technologies).\niii) Improved management of other natural resources (components: organization\nof transhumance and route planning, sustainable management of forest\nresources and sustainable management of fisheries’ resources).\n\n60\n\niv) Agricultural enterprise development and promotion of markets (components:\ndevelopment of agro-food, agriculture peri-urban areas, export crops, short cycle\nlivestock, agro-food forest, fisheries and aquaculture, strengthening of support\nservices to operators; national, regional and international trade promotion).\nv) Prevention and management of food crises and other natural disasters\n(components: promotion of early warning systems, crisis management\ndevelopment and development of compensation / insurance against disasters).\nvi) Institutional reinforcement (components: Improved capacity to formulate\nagricultural and rural policies and strategies, strengthening the capacity,\ncoordination and capacity building for monitoring and evaluation).\n\nAccording to PANA (2006), we identified some additional investments in the agricultural\nsector needed to address the adverse effects of climate change that, so far, are not in\nexecution.\n\nTechnical measures for adaptation to climate change, in agriculture, are being considered\nthrough the following priorities for action:\n\n Conservation and protection systems for agro-forestry and pasture in the\nexisting in the area under study;\n\n Operation of production systems;\n\n Incitement to change more conservative attitudes\n\nWe suggest the following actions for each of the intervention axles proposed above:\n\n1 - Conservation and protection of the two existing production systems in the area under\nstudy\n\na) System for production of bas-fonds\n\nTo improve current water management in small valleys;\n\nDevelop new superficies in small valleys;\n\nDevelop valleys and tributaries of the Geba River;\n\nSupport the mechanization of agriculture;\n\nSupport the development of small irrigation;\n\nGive incentives to farmers to farm in the basin of the Geba River.\n\nb) Plateau production system:\n\nPopularize new varieties adaptable to the environment as well as the\ncapabilities of the peasantry, in particular seed varieties with shorter\ncycle, more productive and resistant to drought;\n\nImprove the genetic material of vegetable and cashew trees and palm\ngroves;\n\nDevelop and implement programs for water management that\nencompasses the micro hydro-agricultural ornaments, construction of\nmicro dams, reservoirs and promotion of small irrigation systems;\n\nDevelop small irrigation schemes;\n\nImprove techniques and agricultural practices in order to intensify and\ndiversify production;\n\nStrengthen the research and dissemination of results;\n\nDevelop programs to conserve and protect the environment and\nimprove the efficiency of the plants;\n\nEncourage the development of horticulture in the hills;\n\n61\n\n\nProtect and conserve forests.\n\n2 - Operation of production systems\n\nThe operationalization of the production is primarily by the actions and measures of crossmonitoring, such as:\n\nRehabilitation of infrastructure;\n\nRehabilitation or construction of access roads that access production\ncenters;\n\nLimit the issuing of permits for logging and revise forest taxes;\n\nAdoption of a National Plan for a Long-Term Agricultural Research\nCentre;\n\nCreation of small agricultural and climatological stations in each\nregion.\n\n3 - Stimulate change for a more conservative attitude\n\nValuation of community radio stations;\n\nStrengthening the ability of different actors in the countryside;\n\nAwareness;\n\nRegulate technically oriented construction, to protect the coast;\n\nDredging of rivers and harbors;\n\nSpatial planning and management of physical space.\n\nAt the institutional level it would be necessary to:\n\nPromote a coherent rural and balanced development policy, through\nmajor investments in infrastructure;\n\nPromote credit systems adapted to the agricultural sector and local\ninitiatives;\n\nPromote conservation techniques, processing, storage and marketing of\nagricultural products;\n\nTraining staff involved in activities related to agriculture.\n\nIn the livestock sector, suggest the following adaptation:\n\nDevelop a Master Plan for Forestry.\n\nEncourage the breeding of short cycle;\n\nImprove the system of management, biological capacity, creating\nconditions for safe production and improve the organization of\nproducers;\n\nPromote the program for genetic improvement of traditional diets;\n\nPromote the training, information and awareness in the livestock\nsector;\n\nSupport the creation of transhumance corridors;\n\nSupport for intensive production of livestock;\n\nDevelop actions for the protection of animal health and the\nimprovement of animal feed;\n\nDevelop small programs and projects that contribute to preserving\ngenetic heritage through the implementation of characteristics which\nmay provide better adaptability.\n\n62\n\nAdaptation measures in forestry sub-sector to climate change must be based on the\nSustainable Management of Forests and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest\nDegradation (REDD). Primarily, it first must be adaptable and must incorporate the emerging\nknowledge of forest-climate interaction. Some measures considered relevant to the\nadaptation of forestry to the adverse effects of climate change are:\n\n\nMonitoring of forests, based on research and application of credible\ntechnologies;\n\nThe productive potential of the site, the extent of the growth period\nand the duration of the dry season should be the determining factors\nin the choice of species for use in reforestation and drought tolerance;\n\nThe best places should be reserved for demanding species with\nregard to soil moisture;\n\nReforestation with advisable orientation may increase the likelihood of\nsurvival of trees;\n\nIn the scenario of temperature increase, which imply an increase of\nforest fires, we should promote the early warning system for risks of\nfire;\n\nEstablishment of a regulatory and effective tax on wood for energy;\n\nPlantations of species with high calorific value and high growth;\n\nPopularize techniques using improved stoves;\n\nOrdinate forests and enhancement of its sustainable production;\n\nCreation of conservation units, especially in fragile ecosystems:\n\nEncourage local conservation initiatives;\n\nTraining for the technical services in terms of material and financial\nresources;\n\nDevelop information and education through the media;\n\nPromote and facilitate natural regeneration;\n\nElaborate plans for forest development in the region.\n\nAdaptation strategies coherent and consistent resources in water, given that climate change\nshould be based on their preservation, exploitation and the rational use, applying the\napproach of integrated management of water resources (WRM). Adaptation options are\ncoherent and consistent especially for the storage of rainwater, in particular and\nimplementation of integrated management of water resources in general. Adaptation\nmeasures in the area covered by the study should be developed on the basis of climate\nscenarios and provided in accordance with the availability of resources in surface water and\ngroundwater, through the observation of the following:\n\nPromote studies to evaluate the possibilities of building dams to retain\nrainwater in order to avoid the loss of these into the rivers, seas and\nocean;\n\nConduct a comprehensive study on the capabilities and characteristics of\nthe river system (tributaries and small flowing streams) with the intention\nof its use for irrigation and construction of small dams to hold water for\nagriculture and livestock breeding;\n\nConstruction of small ramps on the banks of the tributaries of the Geba\nRiver, in order to allow animals to drink the waters of these rivers;\n\nCarry out studies, by implementing large-scale geophysical methods to\nlocate the areas of large fractures or faults of contacts that could provide\nsignificant for the deployment of water points in the framework of\n\n63\n\nhydraulic programs of rural or semi- urban, to supply an appropriate and\nbalanced supply to the agglomerations of populations with significant\nnumbers of inhabitants in the area under study;\n\n\nCreate a program of actions to reduce vulnerability to the effects of\nclimate change and aspects directly linked to the population of the project\npilot area. The program of action should be based on a harmonious\nintegration of scientific knowledge and experience with local voluntary\nmultidisciplinary approach in order to allow project feasible adaptation\nmeasures, such as the dissemination of methods and methodologies for\nwater retention, integration at the level of cultures, through the\nintroduction of varieties that can withstand the extreme conditions of\ndrought and the taking of concrete measures on land use, to limit the risks\nrelated to natural disasters and include the following:\n\nIntegrate participatory management in making important decisions of\ngovernance using local languages;\n\nSynergize with other projects or programs involved in the use of water\nresources and developing sustainable financing mechanisms.\n\nDevelop methods to define and overcome vulnerability to climatic\nconditions based on scientific and social data to ensure the achievement\nof specific data;\n\nGeneral design methods for analysis and to draw on the lessons learned\nand could be used in projects in other locations, thus contributing to the\nexchange of experiences on a national level.\n\nTo address and / or mitigate the vulnerabilities highlighted in the water sector, adaptation\nmeasures identified to alleviate the sufferings of people and create conditions for sustainable\ndevelopment can be grouped into the following four (4) categories:\n\na) Implementation of measures leading to the optimization of water resources.\nHighlighted are: the restoration and management of meteorological measures,\nhydrological and hydro-geological networks, creation of an integrated\ninformation system pertaining to water resources and modernization of tools for\ncollecting, processing and operating an integrated data sector;\n\nb) Implementation of measures aimed at strengthening the capacity of the\nwater resources sector, including institutional and human capacity, as well as\nothers.\n\nc) Implementation of preventive measures for the protection of water\nresources;\n\nd) Implementation of integrated water resources management;\n\nA study on the potentiality of water resources is important, but these features are very\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change, especially when one considers the magnitude of\nthe risks they may face and their respective impacts.\n\nThe effectiveness of adaptation measures identified will depend mainly on:\n\n(i) Political will and commitment of the Government to give due attention to the\nagrarian sector and water resources at the national level, particularly within the\n\n64\n\npilot area of the project, given the importance that these sectors have and are\nlikely to represent for the balance and development of the national economy;\n\n(ii) Defining a clear policy and appropriate strategies for integrated management\nof agricultural patrimony and water resources in the area of the pilot project,\ntaking into account climate change and variability and the manifold impacts that\nconstitute their consequences;\n\n(iii) Monitoring data on the evolution of the effects of climate change in relation to\nchanges in hydrological and hydro-geological parameters.\n\nIt is worthwhile noting that one of the strategies and adaptation measures, addressing\nclimate change, is the appreciation of traditional know-how of communities. Below, Table 34\nillustrates the strategies and adaptation measures envisaged.\n\nTable 34: Strategies and adaptation measures envisaged.\n\n65\n\nSector\nStrategies and adaptation measures\nInteraction with national policies\nand plans\n\nI - AGRARIAN\nSECTOR\n\nAgriculture\n\nForests\n\nLivestock\n\n1.Popularize short-cycle seeds;\n2.Greater disclosure of varieties less\ndependent on water and resistant to\nprolonged droughts;\n3.Increased\norganization\nof\nhydraulic\nworks;\n4.Construction of micro dams and small\ndams for water retention;\n5.Promotion of irrigation systems at low\ncost;\n6.Diversification of production;\n7.Public awareness regarding the use of\nfire early warning system;\n8.Prepare law on burning land for farming;\n9.\nApplication\nof\nefficient\nfarming\ntechniques and ability to prevent or reduce\nthe loss of topsoil.\n10.Based\non\nresearch,\nagronomic\nexperimentation\nand\nbase\nstudies,\norientate the traditional techniques of direct\nexploitation of land to promote recovery\nand exploitation of land for bas-fonds rice\ncultivation, procuring increase the yield of\ncultivated areas in reality..\n\n-\nThe\nAgricultural\nDevelopment\nCharter provides for ensuring food\nsecurity\nand\ndiversification\nof\nproduction in its objectives; its plan of\naction contains measures that fall into\nthese strategies.\n\n- The DENARP Program (NPRSP),\nproposes as its main objective the\nfight against poverty, taking into\naccount the main strategies of the\nagricultural sector.\n1.Conduct a National Inventory of Forests;\n2.Create conservation units, especially in\nthe important and fragile ecosystems;\n3.Promotion\nof\nlocal\ninitiatives\nfor\nconservation and development;\n4.Train and specialize technical services\nand provide them with financial resources;\n5.Set up and / or improve management\nsystems of community forests;\n6.Selection of fast growing plants species\nfor energy purposes;\n7.Restoration and reforestation of degraded\nareas, using species originally found in\neach agro-ecological zone, to enable their\nsustainable management and ensure its\nregeneration in the future.\n\n- The Master Forestry Plan and\nForest Law provide for actions that\ncontribute to the implementation of\nadaptation measures;\n- The measures in the action plan for\npoverty reduction\n- DENARP (NPRSP) PAFT.\n\n1.Use of agricultural by-products treated\nwith urea and molasses for animal feed;\n2.Improvement of pastures through the\nintroduction of plants with better nutritional\nquality\nand\nhigher\nyield\npotential,\nparticularly the species that contribute to\nimproving diet and simultaneously for the\nenrichment of nitrogen in the soil;\n\n3.Promote and stimulate the production of\nshort-cycle animals (goats and sheep).\n\n- The CPDA and its Action Plan\nreviewed and provided for measures\nthat fall within the strategies involved\nfor livestock;\n- The measures in the NPRSP\n(DENARP) Action Plan fit these\nmeasures.\n\n66\n\nV - MEASURES OF MITIGATION OF GHG EMISSIONS\n\nThis chapter presents options and mitigation measures for major sectors of GHG emissions\n(energy and agricultural) identified in the GHG inventory. It should be noted that the\nagricultural sector is formed by agriculture, forestry and livestock.\n\nV.1 - AGRARIAN SECTOR\n\nV.1.1 - Agriculture\n\nIn Guinea-Bissau, farming is done manually and itinerant. They use the system of\noverturning and burning open spaces for agriculture, especially in the highlands. The country\nhas a potential of arable land, estimated at 1,104,000 ha, distributed in a highland ecology.\nOf this total, 300,974 ha are cultivated land. Among the crops, 106,000 ha are mangroves,\ncultivated in an area equivalent to 51,000 ha, of which 200,000 ha are small valleys basfonds, where 150,000 hectares are irrigated and 29,369 ha are cultivated.\n\nGHG Mitigation Options in Agriculture\n\nBased on the above mentioned scenarios, mitigation options of GHG emissions for the\nagricultural sector involve:\n\n\nThe increase of carbon sequestrations in soil and implementation\nactivities and use of mechanisms that remove greenhouse gases into the\natmosphere;\n\nDirect planting system as carbon sequester;\nLivestock -\ncontinued\n\nII - WATER\nRESOURCES\n\n1.Rehabilitation, renovation and extension\nof infrastructure needed to quantitatively\nand qualitatively improve water resources\nand sanitation;\n2.Rehabilitation\nand\nimplementation\nof\ninfrastructure for storm runoff water and the\ndisposal of sewage at critical points in the\nmajor urban centers;\n3.Organization and awareness to change\nmentality\n(creation\nof\nwater\nuser\nassociations), to improve the level of\nknowledge of water resources (hydrology\nand\nhydrogeology)\nand\nits\noperation\n(training);\n4.Implemented and improved a system for\neffective protection of water resources, to\nrationalize the construction of devices for\ntheir capture;\n5.Implementation of effective and integrated\nmanagement of the various uses of water\nresources;\n6.Improve institutional organization, through\nthe reactivation of the CAT, CIMA and CNA;\n7. Updated existing legislation.\n\n- The Director Scheme for the Water\nSector and Sanitation involves the\nstrategies outlined in this document.\n- The measures in the NPRSP Action\nPlan fit those measures.\n- The Water Code, approved by\nGovernment in 1992, establishes the\ngeneral regime for the use of water\nresources as regards management,\nuse and conservation.\n\n- This articulation was done also at\nthe level of integrated management of\nwatersheds and water resources,\nparticularly through OMVG, the AGIR\nproject, and GTZ.\n\n67\n\n\nUse of sustainable agricultural practices with the principles of agroecology and organic agriculture;\n\nBuilding projects in agriculture, forestry and cattle uniting pasture and\ngrain crops.(This is important because when there are more trees in the\nsystem they will be more efficient in reducing the carbon in the\natmosphere);\n\nUsing the method of cultivation \"mobilization zero\", which protects and\nrestores the soil, sequestering carbon;\n\nTechnical support to farmers in the evaluation and identification of risk\nlevels, according to the following trinomial: risk, vulnerability and\nexposure;\n\nValuation of traditional knowledge of farmers in search of strategies for\nmitigation of GHGs;\n\nEncouragement of conservation farming practices (a practice that involves\nminimal soil disturbance and can improve the efficiency of water use,\ncarbon sequestration and improve the ability to withstand inclement\nweather);\n\nConstruction of reservoirs for irrigation (this initiative will contribute to the\nintensification of agricultural production, livestock and forestry);\n\nUse of organic material compositions to improve soil and increase farm\nincome;\n\nStabilization of agricultural land and strengthen traditional ones (this\npractice may help to stop the habit of farming in large areas of forest\nareas);\n\n\nPlanting trees between crops and around the small plots of land, which\nmay help prevent soil erosion, to restore fertility and shade, thereby\ncompensate for some of the effects of climate change.\n\nV.1.2 - Forests\n\nGuinea-Bissau forests contribute 6% to the national GDP and contribute 6.2% to export\nrevenues of the country. Deforestation, i.e. the use of forest resources for other purposes, is\nresponsible for emitting large amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\nThe estimates show a decline of about 625,000 m 3 per year, of the forest area of the\ncountry, namely:\n\n30% reduction in sub-humid dense forests in Tombali;\n\n57% reduction of forests and savannahs in Bafata, Oio and Gabu;\n\n19% reduction of mangrove forests.\n\nThe consumption of firewood in the country is estimated at 296.37 Btu. This represents 87%\nof total consumption (SIE-GB, 2006).\n\nGHG mitigation options in forestry\n\nBased on the above mentioned scenarios, mitigation options of GHG emissions for the forest\nsector involve the following elements and actions:\n\n\nImplementation of a policy of local governance;\n\nInvolvement of local communities in managing forest areas;\n\n68\n\n\nImplementation of efficient mechanisms of control of forest policy, aiming\nat their sustainable management;\n\nRegulation of the profession of the wood and charcoal producer /\nmarketer;\n\nAdoption of compensatory policies to minimize or restore the damage to\nforests;\n\nEncourage scientific research in the field of carbon sequestration and\nenhance sinks in the country;\n\nIntroduction and spread of forms of cleaner domestic energy (methane) in\nthe country and in particular in rural areas;\n\nExploitation of renewable energy sources, improved stoves, using butane\ngas, solar, wind, etc..;\n\nElaborate a strategy for creating an international fund for structural\nmeasures;\n\nCreate central monitoring of our forests and, in particular, protected areas,\nwith a view to maintaining their biodiversity;\n\nReforestation using resistant trees (tolerant to low rainfall and high\ntemperatures) and rapid growth, etc..\n\nV.1.3 - Livestock\n\nLivestock contributes 17% of the national GDP and 32% in the entire agricultural sector and\nis largely responsible for the emission of methane.\n\nGHG Mitigation Options in the livestock sector\n\nBased on the scenarios presented above, the options for mitigation of GHG emissions for\nthe livestock sector include those factors and actions that follow:\n\n\nStimulation\nand\ndevelopment\nof\nscientific\nresearch,\naiming\nat\nimprovement of breeds and genetic digestive process of beef cattle;\n\nThe use of local breeds better adapted to climate and its variations;\n\nRaising livestock in stables, limiting the pressure on the environment,\nespecially in places where grasslands are rare and fodder crops are\npossible;\n\nUse of a pasture is richer in sugar, which facilitate digestion;\n\nReduction of rent for cattle (the profits are split between the tenant and\nthe raiser);\n\nImproving the efficiency of food intake in animals, as well as the\nmanipulation of diet and of better quality;\n\nUse of food additives.\n\nV.2 - ENERGY SECTOR\n\nThe energy situation in the country is distressing. Power plants run with serious hardships\ndue to constant breakdowns of generator groups and often due to lack of diesel. Thus, to\naddress the lack of electricity, most of the urban population uses personal generators to\noperate their business and their homes.\n\nThis sector is the second largest emitter of CO2 after the forestry sector contributing to the\nemission of large quantities of this gas, from the combustion of liquid fossil fuels and air\ntransport, and CO emitted by the residential sector.\n\n69\n\nGHG mitigation options in energy sector\n\nWith the implementation of the LEAP SCREENING program based on the scenarios\nreferred to above, the following were selected:\n\nThe mitigation scenario through the substitution of traditional three-stone\nstoves or carbon stoves, for gas stoves the country would avoid the\nemission of 163,038 TE CO2 at a sale price of carbon of $ 5.2);\n\nThe mitigation scenario, through the construction of Saltinho and\nCussilintra Dams (the country would divert the emission of 1,130,338 TE\nCO2 at a sale price of carbon of $ 7.78);\n\nThe mitigation scenario decentralized rural electrification using a\nphotovoltaic system (the country could safeguard against the issuance of\n47,312 TE CO2 at a sale price of carbon of $ 6.24);\n\nThe mitigation scenario for the interconnection of the electricity grid and\nSambagalou and Kaleta (the country would avoid the emission of 645,170\nTE CO2 at a sale price of carbon of $ 126.72).\n\nVI - ANALYSIS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nVI.1 - INITIAL MACROECONOMIC SITUATION\n\nVI.1.1 – GDP, Growth and Inflation\n\nThe economy of Guinea-Bissau is characterized by the predominance of agriculture (59.6%\nof GDP in 2004), services (28.4%) and industry (12%). Its sluggish rate of growth, from 2000\nto 2004, which stood at around 1%, did not allow for the struggle against poverty to be\nenforced. In the 1990s, there was an annual decline of 1.3% of the indicators of standard of\nliving, which worsened in 2002, reaching 7.2%, which was a direct result of the politicalmilitary conflict that devastated the country between 1998 and 1999. The levels of inflation,\nsometimes with inaccurate determinations, were estimated at around 3.5%, after the\ncountry's accession to UEMOA.\n\nInvestment, despite having registered a sharp growth increase from 9.6% to 14.6% in 2005,\nremained far from the 20% target within the convergence criteria defined by UEMOA. Public\nsavings, with a negative trend between 2001 and 2005, was reversed for the first time,\nreaching 16.2% in 2004. This result was possible thanks to money transfers made by\nimmigrants, according to the Strategic Document for Poverty Reduction (DRSP).\n\nThe country's exports are mainly constituted by cashew nuts, which represent 90% of its\noverall value. Its production has soared in recent years. In 2004, it reached the threshold of\n100,000 tons. It should be noted that the country virtually has no industries and imports most\nof its goods. Although exports covered all imports in 2000 and 2001, that was not the case in\nin 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively, covering only 93.1%, 98.8% and 94.1% of imports.\nThe services balance remained in deficit from 2000 to 2004, with rates of -14.3% in 2003\nand -16.9% of GDP, according to DRSPs.\n\nConsider the Macro Sector situation presented in Chapter I, on national circumstances.\n\n70\n\nVII - NEEDS REQUIRED TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL CAPACITIES IN THE\nFIELDS OF TRAINING, COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION AND AWARENESS ON\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nWith regard to information, education and public awareness, efforts have been made also by\nthe State and its technical and financial partners. These multiple and varied initiatives have\nbeen made through the realization of training seminars, national conferences, radio\ninterviews, production and dissemination of documents dealing with the issue of climate\nchange. It should be noted that, during the preparation of COP 15 in Copenhagen, an\nInformation, Education and Communication (IEC) seminar was held in Bissau entitled\n\"Impact of Climate Change on Productive Sectors of the National Economy\" that was\nattended by decision-makers, parliamentarians, senior technicians, NGOs, Civil Society and\nMedia.\n\nBased on constraints and gaps, listed in Chapter VIII, covering the needs in education,\ntraining and public awareness about climate change, the following needs were ranked in\norder of priorities:\n\n1. Sensitization of economic and industrial decision-makers, with the aim of raising\nawareness among Members of Parliament, Government officials and senior\nmanagement, and economic players on climate change, the Convention and the\nKyoto Protocol: Challenges and prospects, opportunities and prospects for\ninvestment by domestic companies under the CDM;\n2.Education and training of civil society and technical staff on the procedures of\nprojects in the field of climate change, funding procedures, CDM, adaptation\nstrategies and mitigation measures;\n3. Education, information and awareness among farmers about the adverse effects\nof climate change on the environment, the opportunities that the CDM offers\nstrategies for adaptation and mitigation measures;\n4. Education and training of elementary, high school and college students about the\nharmful effects of climate change on the environment, mitigation and adaptation and\nCDM;\n5. Setting up an operational center for information exchange;\n6. Stimulation of Web sites;\n7. Establishment of thematic networks of exchange and reflection;\n8. Preparation and / or strengthening of exchange programs between the parties.\n\nIn conclusion, in implementing the UNFCCC and in accordance with the obligations of the\nparties involved, we have programs concerning education, training and public awareness of\nthe institutional and legal frameworks. In this context, various laws, orders and agreements -\nat National, Sub Regional and Regional levels - were endorsed and supported by various\ninitiatives and projects. Despite numerous initiatives and projects, it appears that few\ninitiatives have been undertaken so far by rural area decision-makers and for students who\nare the prime targets. Technicians have been struggling with limited success to convey the\nknowledge they hold. This is why there are still gaps and constraints that obstruct the\neffective implementation of the Convention.\n\nGiven this situation, the main actions to be undertaken will address:\n\nDecision-makers and economic policies;\n\nRepresentatives of civil society and technical staff;\n\nProducers;\n\nStudents.\n\nTo this end, the Action Program should aim at the targets listed above as items 1 through 8.\n\n71\n\nVIII - OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION\n\nVIII.1 - PRIORITY NEEDS IN THE AREA OF ADAPTATION\n\nIn case of PANA\n\nThe development objective of PANA in Guinea-Bissau is to help mitigate the adverse effects\nof climate change on vulnerable populations, from the perspective of sustainable\ndevelopment and combating poverty. Therefore the PANA presents a summary of the\ncontents of the priority needs to be taken to address immediate concerns and needs to\nadapt to the adverse effects of climate change.\n\nVIII.1.1 - Selection and ranking of priority activities of PANA\n\nThe identification of sectors and groups of particularly vulnerable population was carried out\nin a technical seminar for validation, taking into account the National Strategy for Poverty\nReduction and the conclusions of the sector studies on vulnerability and adaptation to\nclimate change effects. In another seminar, based on an array of analysis of multiple criteria,\nbelow, resolved on the following order of priorities, according to the scores:\n\nTable 35: Options from the analysis of multiple criteria: 1) level of severity of impacts, 2) poverty\nreduction, and 3) synergy with AMA, 4) costs, 5) gender,6) recipients.\nSource: PANA (2006).\n\nPROJECTS\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nTOTAL\n Coastal Zone\n\n1 (protection, conservation and\nenhancement of fishery and coastal\nresources)\n3\n2\n3\n3\n4\n3\n18\n2 (Observatory of the Mangrove)\n5\n3\n3\n3\n4\n4\n22\n3 (Prevention of natural disasters)\n4\n2\n2\n3\n2\n5\n18\n4 (Nat Res com.)\n5\n4\n3\n2\n4\n4\n22\nWater Resources\n\n5 (Rural Water)\n4\n5\n2\n1\n5\n5\n22\n6 (DGGH Institutional Support)\n4\n3\n2\n2\n2\n4\n17\nAgriculture\n\n7 (Integrated information on food\nsafety)\n4\n4\n2\n3\n2\n5\n20\n8 (Diversification of Production).\n5\n5\n3\n2\n5\n5\n25\n9 (Alternative Energy)\n4\n3\n4\n4\n4\n4\n23\n10 (promotion of small irrigation along\nthe Geba and Corubal Rivers)\n4\n4\n3\n1\n5\n3\n20\n11 (Reforestation of degraded areas)\n3\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n15\n12 (Rehabilitation of small perimeters\nof mangrove soils for growing rice)\n4\n4\n2\n2\n3\n3\n18\n13 (Short cycle animal production)\n2\n4\n2\n2\n3\n3\n16\n\n72\n\nTable 36: As a result of an exercise done, we obtained the following hierarchy of projects, whose\nlocation and costs are presented in the table below.\n\nOrder of\npriorities\nProject Designation\nArea\nof\nGeographic\nIntervention\nEstimated Costs\n1st\nProject to support the\ndiversification of production\nand the Dietary Food\nSouthern\nProvince\n(Quinara\nand Tombali Regions)\n$ 600,000\n2nd\nImprove Drinking Water\nSupply Project in Rural\nAreas\nSouthern Province (Quinara\nand Tombali Regions)\nEastern Province (Bafata and\nGabu Regions)\n$ 1,000,000\n3rd\nCapacity Building Project\nfor Prevention and\nProtection of Mangrove\nFields Against Water\nInvasions\nSouthern Province (Tombali,\nand Quinara Bolama / Bijagós\nRegions)\nNorthern Province (Cacheu\nRegion)\n$ 600,000\n4th\nCentre for Monitoring and\nEvaluation of Mangroves\nProject\nNorthern\nProvince\n(Cacheu)\nRegion\nSouthern Province (Bolama /\nBijagós Region)\n$ 800,000\n5th\nCoastal Erosion Zone\nFollow-up Project\nNorthern\nProvince\n(Cacheu\nRegion)\nSouthern Province (Bolama /\nBijagós Region)\n$ 400,000\n6th\nEvaluation of Impact\nClimate Change on\nProducers’ Sectors Project\nThroughout the National\nterritory\n\n$ 350,000\n7th\nPromotion\nof\nSmall\nIrrigation in the Geba and\nCorubal\nRiver\nMargins\nProject\nEastern Province (Bafata and\nGabu Regions)\nNorthern Province (Oio Region)\n$ 800,000\n8th\nPrevention\nof\nNatural\nDisasters Project\nThroughout\nthe\nNational\nterritory\n$ 300,000\n9th.\nProtection,\nConservation\nand\nEnhancement\nof\nCoastal\nand\nFisheries\nResources Project\nCoastal Zone (Northern and\nSouthern Province)\n$ 450,000\n10th\nIntegrated\nInformation\nSystem on Food Security\n(SISA) Project\nThroughout the national territory\n$ 300,000\n11th\nEnvironmental Education\nand Communication in the\nCoastal Zone Project\nCoastal Zone (Northern and\nSouthern Province)\n$ 200,000\n12th\nSmall Perimeters of\nMangrove Soil for Growing\nRice in Tombali, Quinara,\nBafata and Oio\nRehabilitation Project\nEastern\nProvince\n(Bafatá\nRegion)\nNorthern Province (Oio Region)\nSouthern\nProvince\n(Quinara\nand Tombali)\n$ 500,000\n13th\nShort Cycle Animal\nProduction Support Project\nEastern\nProvince\n(Bafatá\nRegion)\nNorthern Province (Oio Region)\nSouthern\nProvince\n(Quinara\nand Tombali Regions)\n$ 400,000\n14th\nResettlement in Degraded\nForest Zones Project\nEastern\nProvince\n(Bafatá\nRegion)\n\n$ 500,000\nTOTAL\n Six Million, Three Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars\n$ 6,300,000\n\n73\n\nSource: PANA (2006)\n\nThese priorities are essentially aimed at increasing the level of food security of rural\npopulations, aiming to strengthen their capacity for adaptation, reducing pressure on forest\nresources and fisheries, and improved access to potable water for human consumption and\nlivestock. It is emphasized that climate change exerts a negative influence on the quality and\nquantity of water resources by reducing rainfall. The same is true for the conservation and\nrecovery of fish stocks and coastal zones, as well as the utilization of the enormous potential\nof existing agrarian.\n\nIt should be noted that according to the Agricultural Development Policy Charter (CPDA), the\nCountry cannot guarantee food security without diversifying their food production, including\nshort-cycle animal production. The country relies heavily on rice. Since domestic production\nof rice is not enough to cover the cycle of self-sufficiency, the majority of households in\nGuinea-Bissau apply the proceeds from cashew nut sales - the main export – to buy or trade\nfor rice.\n\nIn addition to the destruction of thousands of hectares of mangrove rice fields due to flooding\ncaused by high tides during the last agricultural season, the price of cashew nuts in the\ninternational market fell substantially, reflecting negatively on the producer price in 2005 and\n2006. This drop in producer price, coupled with the limited financial capacity for the\noverwhelming majority of the country's rural population caused serious consequences and\nincreased hunger and / or malnutrition.\n\nThis choice seeks to fulfill needs to maintain the synergies between this program and other\ninternational conventions, plans and internal policies of Guinea-Bissau.\n\nVIII.2 - PRIORITY NEEDS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER\n\nVIII.2.1 - OBJECTVE\n\nThe basic objective of this chapter is to identify the different technologies in sectors\nconsidered to be most important in relation to the welfare of the national economy.\n\nVIII.2.2 - Identification of needs in the field of technology and its transfer\n\nThe Government, Industry and Producers of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, in general, are\nvery interested in improving existing technologies in the Country, in various sectors and to\nimport technologies adaptable to our reality.\n\nIt’s worthwhile to note that in this Technology Transfer, the most important thing to observe\nis the acquisition of environmental technology, considered \"friendly\" to the environment, and\nthat also contribute to the welfare of the national economy.\n\nIn order to allow the country to develop its own technologies and modernize itself through\ninnovation, it becomes imperative to create and develop within the Universities and Institutes\nResearch and Development (R & D) activities\n\nHowever, for the initiation and development of this work its necessary to know, in detail, the\ntechnologies used in each of the selected sectors and those considered important to the\nwell-being and development of the country. One of the sources of technological information\nneeded for our work was to identify applied technologies in the different sectors of the\ncountry.\n\n74\n\nIndeed, it is recognized that in the country, most sectors do not have technologies in the true\nsense of the word, and those that did are actually very old.\n\nConsequently, one can infer that the country needs to be systematically informed about the\nlatest technologies that could bring benefits to various sectors of the national economic life.\n\nVIII.2.2.1 - Agriculture\n\nExisting agriculture technologies used today in the Country are considered rudimentary,\nsuch as plows, hoes, machetes, scythes and very few small machines such as tractors from\nthe 1960s to the 1990s. Despite the fact that these technologies are traditional, they have\ntheir negative impacts on the adaptation of populations to their habitats.\n\nAgriculture, even though for subsistence, cannot and should not continue with this type.\nThus, it is urgent that the Country adopt measures and policies that meet the aspirations of\nthe agricultural sector, with regard to Technology Transfer.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to transfer technology in this sector since the country needs to\nincrease the quantity and quality of its production, which is only possible with the use of\nmodern techniques and a scientific agriculture to ensure food safety factor prominently\nfeatured in the UNFCCC and the process of adaptation of populations.\n\nSince Technology Transfer is one form of innovation, it is important that trained human\nresources are available to take ownership and full advantage of technology.\n\nIt is imperative to carry out technology transfer in agriculture with extensive use of new\ntechnology to increase the quantity and quality of production.\n\nThe Technology Transfer required and recommended to address the objectives of\ndevelopment, are as follows:\n\n Technology Transfer for the production:\na) Tractors, harvesters, seeders, etc..\n(Special machines)\n\n Transfer of knowledge;\n Transfer of techniques;\n Staff Training\n\nVIII.2.2.2.Energy\n\nThe strategy to build energy foundations necessary for the country's development\nnecessarily involves the transfer of technology in this sector, hence it is proposed:\n\n Wind Energy:\n\nWind energy has a more modest potential, favored by the country's geomorphology and\ngeographical location (island part). The bas-reliefs, the plains, the existence of a vast\ncoastline and an Archipelago directly bathed by the Atlantic Ocean, causes the country to be\ncrossed by a system of winds whose annual average speed is between 3 and 30m 5m/sa\nsun . (European Éolien Atlas (Class C).\n\nThese characteristics were mentioned in the “Carta Mundial da Produtividade de\nEenergia Eólica” (Global Wind Energy Productivity Charter), which confirms the\n\n75\n\npossibility of using this form of energy, large-scale, low cost, in over 50% of coastal regions -\nconnected or isolated networks - and small scale for water pumping and electrification of\nsmall villages.\n\nHowever, we emphasize that, while not burning fossil fuels and not emitting pollutants, wind\nenergy is not devoid of environmental impacts. They alter landscapes with their towers and\ntheir propellers, and may threaten birds, if they are installed on migration routes. They emit a\ncertain level of noise (low frequency), which can cause some discomfort. Moreover, they\nmay cause interference to television networks broadcast.\n\n Solar Energy:\n\nAccording to the National Meteorological Data and data available on regional and\ninternational levels, (ASECNA, UNESCO, GRUNDFOS, TOTAL ENERGIE), daily radiation is\nmore or less 5.5 kWh / m² (average of 2,000 kWh / m² / year) for an insulation average of 8\nhours / day, i.e. 2,920 hours per year. This will allow the country to reasonably exploit that\nform of energy.\n\n Water Resources\n\nRegarding the Transfer of Technology in this sector for the capture, retention, storage and\ndistribution of water, we note that it can be done through the use of new technology in the\nmanufacture of special deposits or reservoirs, cisterns, improved tanks and dams. This will\nhave a reserve of water for later use, for human consumption, irrigation, and possibly for\ngeneration of hydropower.\n\n Industrial Sector\n\nWith regard to the need for Technology Transfer in this sector, the following might\nconjectured:\n\nIt is known that the nature of environmental problems is partly attributed to the complex\nindustrial processes used by man; any product, no matter what the material is or what the\npurpose of its use causes an impact on the environment, either because of the production\nprocess of raw materials which are consumed in their manufacture or due to its use or\ndisposal (CHEHESE, 1997). Since the industrial sector is the domain of processing\nmaterials, all processes involving this industry needs Technology Transfer that are\nenvironmentally friendly, with a view to lowering carbon development.\n\n Tourism Sector\n\nWith regard to technologies used in this sector, we have not identified any thus far.\n\n Fisheries Sector\n\nThis sector is recommended for the following Transfer of Technology:\n\na) Transfer of technology in sophisticated systems of conservation;\nb) Transfer of technology for systems’ transformation;\nc) Transfer of technology in packaging systems.\n\n Waste Sector\n\n76\n\nConcerning the waste sector, more specifically regarding the treatment of such waste, the\ntechnology used is rudimentary and reduces the burning of debris in the open, with the\nemission of CO2, CO, N2O to the atmosphere. In this line, there is a great need to implement\ntechnologies for composting and sophisticated incineration. Thus, the following technologies\nare recommended for this sector: recycling and reuse of certain wastes, selection and\nseparation of waste by type (organic waste, glass, and paper, plastic) and containers.\n\n Transportation\n\nIn this sector very old technologies are still used with diesel and gasoline as fuels whose\nimpact is negative for the environment.\n\nHowever, it is suggested that in the future, technologies be acquired in this sector, in which\nfuel to be used are those considered environmentally friendly (bio-fuels) or \"green\"\ntechnologies.\n\nIt should be emphasized that Guinea-Bissau has major shortcomings in terms of acquisition\nof new technologies in the transport sector. The old ones currently used in the Country are\nthose in which the engines operate by burning fossil fuel. Given the need for technology\ntransfer, it is worth mentioning the fact that clean technologies used in “developed countries”\nhave a high cost and its transfer to third parties requires substantial financial resources, due\nto its protection under the Industrial Property Rights. Moreover, the technologies currently\nbeing used and tested in some developed countries, and / or \"frontier\" technology are based\nHydrogen / Bio-fuel. Thus, for Transfer of Technology in this sector, we recommend the\nfollowing: adoption of the technology base for biodiesel and hybrid engines (Hydrogen).\n\n Health Sector\n\nIn the health sector, we could not identify technologies applied, yet the country needs to\nacquire new technologies, so as to meet the new requirements for public health. In this vein,\nthe perfect understanding of these needs could enable the country to import a variety of\ntechnologies for the hospital sector: solid waste incineration, treatment related to oxygen and\nozone, water treatment with ozone and hospital food freezing with liquid nitrogen, like in\nmany other countries. In the same vein, it is recommended for Technology Transfer, process\nof incineration, water treatment hospital with ozone; freeze foods with liquid N2.\n\nIX - CONSTRAINTS AND GAPS\n\nIn terms of vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation measures to climate change effects,\nconstraints can be found at three levels: human, material and / or technical and\nfinancial.\n\nIX.1 - HUMAN LEVEL\n\nFrom a human stand point, mainly the following points:\n\nPoor development of education, training and research on climate change,\nparticularly with regard to both vulnerability and adaptation;\n\nLack of mastery of tools and methodologies for GHG inventory, properly\nassess vulnerability and adaptation to climate change;\n\nInsufficiency of scientific backgrounds on certain aspects, such as\nvulnerability, adaptation and mitigation of the impact of climate;\n\nLack of knowledge on the part of national actors, the problems and\nchallenges of climate change;\n\n77\n\n\nWeak culture of documentation and filing.\n\nConstant political instability\n\nIX.2 - MATERIAL AND TECHNICAL LEVEL\n\nAt this level the following constraints are particularly apparent:\n\nLack of national institutions for research and systematic observation in the\nweather and water sciences, (meteorological, hydrological);\n\nLack of specialized personnel in the field of climate change;\n\nLack of a national database (hydrology, hydrogeology, forest inventory)\naccessible and structured for better vulnerability assessment and\nadaptation;\n\nLack of a method of documentation and data archives;\n\nLack of long term climatic parameters monitoring and surveillance units;\n\nLack of a specific coherent model with good resolution for the assessment\nof vulnerability and adaptation applicable for all sectors;\n\nLack of effective systems for weather and hydrological forecasts;\n\nLack of a national center specializing in research on climate change;\n\nInsufficiency of nationwide material means of collecting, archiving for\nanalysis and communication (GIS, Remote Sensing, etc..).\n\nIX.3 - FINANCIAL LEVEL\n\nThe following difficulties are mainly distinguished at this level:\n\n\nWeak financial capacity of the State and research institutions, for\ncollection, storage and analysis of climatic data and natural renewable\nresources;\n\nLack of financial resources to purchase and acquire certain data and\nsoftware necessary for vulnerability assessment and adaptation;\n\nInsufficient financial resources to strengthen capacity and build an\nenduring system for assessing vulnerability and adaptation;\n\nWeak mobilization of resources to fund programs and adaptation\nstrategies.\n\nWith regard to systematic observation, systems for meteorological, atmospheric,\nclimatological, satellite, hydrological observations, and others, are the basic elements\nessential to study the planet's climate. These systems do not exist in the Country, and the\nmeteorological observation process has been going through continuing degradation, taking\ninto account the economic and financial difficulties that the Country faces.\n This resulted in the country's lack of contribution to the global programs of observation and\nclimate research. The constraints of research and systematic observations, linked to climate\nchange, can be summarized at the national level, highlighting the following issues:\n\n\nFailure in quality and quantity of skilled human resources;\n\nEconomic and financial difficulties;\n\nFailure and / or inadequacy of infrastructure necessary to conduct the\ninvestigation;\n\nLack of inter-discipline;\n\n78\n\n\nInsufficient human dimension involvement in climate change, often\nignoring socio-economic and policies;\n\nInability to pay for expensive meteorological equipment.\n\nThe following are verified on the Regional level:\n\nLack of a consistent and permanent synoptic observations network,\nthroughout all of Africa;\n\nAbsence of consistent, continuous, consistent and robust climate\nobservation network;\n\nLack of a reliable telecommunications network, which would facilitate the\nexchange of data and support systems for forecasting and early warning\nsystems to establish and ensure sustainable development;\n\nLack of a radar network for areas exposed to bad weather - an essential\ntool for an early warning system;\n\nWeak integration of climate change policies, strategies and development\nprograms (public policy).\n\nWith regard to the needs to reinforce capacity building in training, communication,\nawareness and information gaps and constraints still exist and obstruct the effective\nimplementation of the Convention. Among these the following may be cited:\n\n\nWeak understanding of climate change by the very ones in charge of\nraising awareness around this concept;\n\nInsufficiency and lack of awareness support adaptation;\n\nHigh illiteracy rate of the population causes difficulty in understanding\nmessages;\n\nInsufficiency in assessing climate change;\n\nInadequate allocation of resources for further education, training and\npublic awareness actions;\n\nRelatively high cost to take advantage of media (newspapers, printing,\nradio, television, etc...), activities for Information, Education and\nCommunication (IEC);\n\nLow interest to this Convention by the civil society, taking into account its\ncomplexity and its technical character;\n\nLack of consideration of the issue of climate change into national policies\nand strategies of development;\n\nWeak financial contribution mechanism of the Convention for developing\ncountries’ actions, due to overly complex and lengthy procedures;\n\nInsufficiency of national mechanisms for trade, promotion and\ndissemination of information.\n\n79\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAfricapractice.

Cooperation with non-governmental organisations, the private sector and civil society\nCooperation between the Government of Guinea-Bissau, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the\nprivate sector and civil society has assumed an increasingly important role in the national response to\nclimate change and in promoting environmental sustainability. In a context of limited institutional and\nfinancial resources, these actors have provided technical support, community mobilisation, project\nimplementation and advocacy, complementing government actions and strengthening the resilience of\nthe most vulnerable communities.\nBoth national and international NGOs are among the main drivers of the implementation of adaptation\nand mitigation projects in the country. Organisations such as the Institute for Biodiversity and Protected\nAreas (IBAP), in close collaboration with international partners (IICN, Wetlands International, WWF,\nTiniguena, etc.), have promoted ecosystem conservation, mangrove restoration and biodiversity\nprotection. These actions not only contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, but also\nstrengthen the livelihoods of local people who depend on natural resources.\nOrganised civil society, through community associations, networks of women, young people and\nfarmers, plays a key role in raising awareness, monitoring public policies and implementing local\nsolutions. Initiatives by community radio, youth movements, and grassroots organisations have extended\nthe reach of environmental education messages, ensuring that they reach the population in national\nlanguages and accessible formats. The involvement of civil society has also contributed to greater social\ninclusion and gender equity in decision-making processes related to climate change.\nThe private sector, although still incipient in this area, has started to assume a more important role in the\nfinancing and adoption of clean technologies, particularly in renewable energies and waste management.\nLocal businesses and international operators have invested in decentralised solar solutions, community\nmini-grids and energy efficiency initiatives, demonstrating the potential of public-private partnerships to\naccelerate Guinea-Bissau's energy transition. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises have been\nactive in sustainable agriculture and ecotourism, aligning economic interests with environmental\nobjectives.\nHowever, cooperation between government, NGOs, the private sector and civil society faces significant\nchallenges. Among them, the lack of formal coordination mechanisms, the dispersion of initiatives\nwithout full alignment with national priorities and the scarcity of qualified financial and human resources\nstand out. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to strengthen the mechanisms of multi-sectoral\n\n134\n\ndialogue, institutionalise consultation platforms and create incentives that promote innovation and\nprivate sector involvement.\nOverall, Guinea-Bissau recognises that building an effective and sustainable climate response depends\non the collective mobilisation of all social actors. The consolidation of inclusive and collaborative\npartnerships will not only increase the effectiveness of ongoing actions, but will also pave the way for\nattracting new funding, the development of local technologies and the valorisation of traditional\nknowledge of communities. Thus, cooperation with NGOs, the private sector and civil society is an\nindispensable pillar for achieving the objectives of the Convention and ensuring a more resilient and\nsustainable future for the country.\nTable0-2Subject: Cooperation with NGOs, the private sector and civil society in Guinea-Bissau\nActors\nCurrent\ncontributions\nGaps\nPriority measures\nStrategic Partners\nNational and\ninternational NGOs\nImplementation of\nconservation,\nadaptation and\nmitigation projects;\nmangrove\nrestoration;\nbiodiversity\nmonitoring;\ncommunity\nenvironmental\neducation.\nScattered initiatives;\nlack of coordination\nwith national\npolicies; dependence\non external\nfinancing.\nStrengthen\ncoordination with\nthe government;\nintegrate actions into\nnational strategies;\ntrain local\ntechnicians; create\nfinancial\nsustainability plans.\nIBAP, Wetlands\nInternational,\nTiniguena, WWF,\nUNDP, GEF, FAO.\nCivil society and\ncommunity\nassociations\nCommunity\nmobilisation;\nawareness raising\nand environmental\neducation;\nparticipation in local\nforums and\ncommittees;\nintegration of\nwomen and young\npeople.\nLimited participation\nin formal decisionmaking processes;\nuneven geographical\ncoverage; poor\ncoordination with\npublic institutions.\nEstablish permanent\nmechanisms for\ncommunity\nparticipation;\nstrengthen the\nrepresentation of\nwomen and young\npeople;\ninstitutionalise\nadvisory councils.\nLocal associations of\nwomen and youth,\ncommunity radio,\nNGO, IBAP,\nMABAC.\nPrivate sector\nInvestments in\nrenewable energy\n(solar mini-grids,\nphotovoltaic\nsystems); sustainable\nagriculture;\necotourism;\nenergy efficiency;\nclean technology\nsupply.\nLow systemic\nparticipation; lack of\nincentives; weak\nintegration in\nnational climate\nstrategies.\nDevelop publicprivate partnerships;\ncreate fiscal and\nfinancial incentives;\nfoster local\ntechnological\ninnovation; and\nincrease\ninvestment in\nclimate solutions.\nLocal and\ninternational\ncompanies,\nMABAC, Ministries\nof Energy and\nEnvironment,\nfinancial\ninstitutions, GEF,\nUNDP.\nMulti-stakeholder\nplatforms\nOccasional national\nfora and dialogues;\nlimited coordination\nof actions.\nLack of formal and\npermanent\nplatforms; weak\ninter-institutional\nand multi-sectoral\ncoordination.\nEstablish national\ncoordination\nplatforms;\ninstitutionalise\nregular dialogue and\nmonitoring fora;\nalign initiatives with\nNDCs\n\n135\n\n5.6. Systematic Research and Observation\nScientific research and systematic observation are fundamental tools to understand the dynamics of\nclimate change, assess its impacts and support the definition of appropriate mitigation and adaptation\npolicies and measures. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)\nrecognises that reliable data collection, continuous monitoring, and multidisciplinary research are\nessential conditions for improving countries’ ability to respond to climate challenges, reduce uncertainty,\nand promote informed decision-making.\nIn Guinea-Bissau, research and climate observation systems face several historical limitations, mainly\nrelated to institutional fragility, lack of financial resources, scarcity of modern equipment and low critical\nmass of specialised researchers. However, significant progress has been made in recent years through\ninternational cooperation, the implementation of climate projects and the strengthening of national\ntechnical capacities.\n5.6.1. Scientific research in Guinea-Bissau\nScientific research on climate change in Guinea-Bissau is still at an early stage, reflecting structural,\nfinancial and institutional limitations that limit the country's ability to produce scientific knowledge.\nUniversities and research centres, especially the Amílcar Cabral University (UAC), play a central role in\nfostering research, although their contributions remain limited. The main obstacles include:\n\nfinancial constraints, which prevent the continued funding of research projects;\n\nshortage of laboratories and appropriate scientific equipment, which compromises the conduct\nof more in-depth and experimental studies;\n\ninsufficient advanced training of teachers and researchers, which limits the ability to guide\nspecialised research and publish in international scientific journals.\nDespite these limitations, some positive initiatives have been observed, often carried out in partnership\nwith international organisations and NGOs, which have allowed the development of studies applied in\npriority areas for the country, namely:\n\nagricultural adaptation to drought and precipitation variations, including climate-smart farming\npractices;\n\nsustainable management of mangroves and coastal ecosystems, with a focus on protection against\nerosion and the preservation of biodiversity;\n\nimpacts of climate variability on rural communities, in particular on food security and\nlivelihoods;\n\nlocal resilience practices, which value traditional knowledge and community adaptation to\nclimate risks.\nInterdisciplinary research, which combines the natural, social and economic sciences, is still at an early\nstage, but is beginning to gain prominence and relevance. This progress is due in part to the integration\nof Guinea-Bissau into regional networks such as ECOWAS, WAEMU and African Union programmes,\nwhich promote:\n\nthe exchange of scientific experience between the countries of the sub-region;\n\n136\n\n\naccess to scholarships and academic mobility programmes;\n\nsharing data and research methodologies, strengthening international scientific cooperation.\nIn summary, the actual state of scientific research in Guinea-Bissau can be characterised as a process\nunder construction, which combines significant internal limitations with growing external opportunities.\nStrengthening this area depends on investing in advanced training of researchers, creating adequate\nscientific infrastructure and integrating more strongly into international networks for the production and\ndissemination of knowledge.\n5.6.2. Systematic Observation - Meteorological and Climatological\nThe systematic observation of climate and meteorology in Guinea-Bissau is largely ensured by the\nNational Institute of Meteorology of Guinea-Bissau (INM-GB), an entity that plays a central role in the\ncollection, management and dissemination of atmospheric and climatological data. INM-GB’s work is\nessential not only to support daily weather forecasts, but also to provide key scientific information for\nagriculture, water management, civil aviation, public health, and, more recently, for early warning\nsystems and climate change adaptation.\nCurrently, the country’s weather observation network remains limited. The country has a limited number\nof stations, both automatic and manual, whose distribution is uneven, leaving several regions without\nadequate coverage. This gap undermines the collection of nationally representative data and makes it\ndifficult to monitor climate variability in detail, especially in areas most vulnerable to droughts, floods,\nand extreme events.\nAnother significant challenge is the obsolescence and maintenance of equipment. Many existing stations\nuse outdated technology, which often faces calibration and repair difficulties due to scarcity of\nreplacement parts and limited national technical capacity to ensure continuous maintenance. This directly\nimpacts the quality and continuity of time series, which are essential for long-term climate analysis,\nfuture scenario modelling and sector planning.\nDespite these structural limitations, recent projects have brought about significant improvements. With\nthe support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank, actions are\nunder way within the framework of the Rapid Alert Project, which includes the installation of new\nautomatic weather stations at strategic points in the country. This new equipment represents a significant\nadvance, allowing the collection of data in real time and automatic transmission to centralised analysis\nsystems, increasing the reliability and punctuality of the available meteorological information.\nThe partial modernisation of the network, combined with training programmes for national technicians,\nprovides a promising basis for strengthening systematic observation. However, the system still requires\nadditional investments to meet regional and international quality standards, including:\n\nthe expansion of the territorial coverage of the observation network;\n\nreinforcement of preventive and corrective maintenance of equipment;\n\nthe consolidation of accessible and interoperable digital databases;\n\nand the continuous training of technicians in meteorological and climatological monitoring\ntechnologies.\n\n137\n\nThus, the actual state of meteorological and climatological observation in Guinea-Bissau is characterised\nby recent but still insufficient progress, revealing a sector in transition: from a limited and vulnerable\nnetwork to a more modern and reliable structure, supported by international partnerships and the national\ncommitment to improve climate forecasting and adaptation systems.\nCurrently, the basic surface meteorological observation network in Guinea-Bissau consists of:\n\nsynoptic stations, of which 03 are partially operational (Bissau, Bolama and Bafatá). These\nstations do not measure wind and 01 of them (Bolama) has no barometer to measure atmospheric\npressure.\n\n04 main weather stations (Bissau, Bolama, Bafatá and Gabú), also partially operational.\n\n12 auxiliary weather stations, inoperative.\n\n07 agro-meteorological stations, inoperative.\n\nrainy seasons, of which 22 are in operation.\nBoth in the main weather stations and rainfall stations, local observers face significant difficulties in\ntransmitting data to the INM-GB in Bissau. They depend on state-owned landlines – whose network is\nbeing rapidly deactivated – or mobile phones, often needing to use their own resources to purchase credits\nand send data/information to headquarters. In other words, the entire network, as well as the systems and\nprotocols that support it, is quite precarious.\nAccording to INM-GB, the main causes of the limitations in data collection by the surface meteorological\nobservation network in Guinea-Bissau are:\n\nThe political-military conflict of 1998/1999, which practically destroyed the network existing at\nthe time.\n\nThe lack of adequate training in the country - careers in meteorology and related fields should be\nsought abroad.\n\nThe lack of financial resources in the INM-GB, insufficient for the acquisition of technical\nequipment (necessary for the replacement, expansion and updating of hardware and software),\nmaintenance of the building, furniture, consumables, payment of public services, security, among\nothers.\nIn addition, the INM-GB has a low level of technological incorporation, for example, still relying on\nfixed lines and regular visual observations of the team to collect meteorological data.\n\nNumber37Subject: Location of meteorological, rainfall and hydrological stations\n\n138\n\n5.6.3. Systematic Observation - Hydrology and Water Resources\nThe Directorate-General for Water Resources (DGRH), through its Hydrology Services, is the main\nentity responsible for monitoring rivers, aquifers and river basins in Guinea-Bissau. The role of HRD is\ncrucial to ensure up-to-date knowledge on water availability and quality, an essential element for food\nsecurity, public health, energy production and adaptation to climate change.\nIn recent years, the national hydrological network has been revitalised after a long period of fragility and\nlack of regular maintenance. Efforts are underway to install new hydrometric and rainfall stations, located\nat strategic points in major river basins. This equipment allows the collection of essential data on river\nflow, groundwater levels and precipitation, thus strengthening the analysis and planning capabilities in\nvarious sectors.\nThe data produced by the hydrological network are of great importance for:\n\nsustainable management of water resources, including planning their use in different economic\nsectors;\n\nflood prevention and forecasting, reducing risks to vulnerable communities;\n\nagricultural planning, allowing anticipating periods of drought or excessive rainfall;\n\nand support for the formulation of public policies based on reliable scientific information.\nDespite these advances, there are still significant challenges that limit the full operability and\neffectiveness of the system:\n\nInsufficient equipment: the installed network still does not cover the entire national territory,\nleaving several areas without systematic monitoring.\n\nMaintenance difficulties: Recurrent problems with failures, lack of replacement parts and\nshortage of specialised technicians compromise the continuity of data collection.\n\nLack of an integrated digital system: Currently, there is no modern national database that allows\nto centralise, store, process and make available in an accessible way the hydrological information\ncollected.\nIn short, the actual state of hydrological observation in Guinea-Bissau is characterised by a transition\nprocess, marked by significant progress, particularly in the context of international cooperation projects,\nbut still with structural and institutional gaps. The strengthening of the hydrological network, coupled\nwith the development of an integrated digital system and the continuous training of national technicians,\nwill be crucial to consolidate a more efficient, preventive and sustainable management of the country's\nwater resources.\nThe monitoring of water resources is carried out by the Directorate-General for Water Resources\n(DGRH), through the Hydrology Services, which maintain a network of hydrometric and rainfall stations\ndistributed across the main river basins of the country.\n\nHydrometric stations: Equipped to measure water levels and flows in large rivers and streams,\nthey are essential for flood monitoring, drought forecasting and water resources management.\n\nPrecipitation seasons: record precipitation at different points of the territory, allowing to evaluate\nthe spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall.\n\n139\n\n\nIntegration with alerts: Data from these stations feed early warning systems, used especially in\nregions vulnerable to floods, such as Bafatá, Gabú and the Geba estuary.\n\nTechnical challenges: Many stations still lack proper maintenance, regular calibration and realtime data communication, limiting their effectiveness for hydrological modelling and extreme\nevent prediction.\n\nNumber38Subject: Hydrological observation network\nThe installation and operation of the hydrological observation network in Guinea-Bissau has been almost\nentirely carried out by development partners, who have funded almost all the hydrological projects\ncarried out to date. The country's cooperation with these partners began in the 1950s, during the colonial\nperiod, through Portugal. Other bilateral, multilateral and sub-regional organisations have also\ncontributed to the development of hydrological services in Guinea-Bissau. Among them, we highlight:\nthe Portuguese Institute of the Environment, the French Development Agency (AFD), the UNDP, the\nWorld Meteorological Organisation (WMO), the AGRHYMET / CILSS Regional Centres, OMVG,\namong others.\nThese partners have contributed in various ways, providing financing and technical assistance through\nprojects, as well as ensuring the physical installation and maintenance of hydrological monitoring\nequipment. Training and development were also offered to technicians from national institutions and in\nsome cases salaries were guaranteed to observers and service technicians. This reflects the chronic\ndifficulties of the government of Guinea-Bissau in properly maintaining the state apparatus and providing\nsufficient services to the population.\nThe monitoring of the hydrological observation network is an important segment within the different\ntypes of water services provided by the State. It generates public goods and global benefits, as well as\ndirect benefits for adaptation to climate change. Together with the meteorological, observation and\nmonitoring services of the hydrological network are essential for the consolidation of climate services in GuineaBissau.\n\n140\n\nIn terms of staffing, public institutions responsible for the water sector — whether Human Resource\nDevelopment in general or specific technical hydrology services — face long-standing problems of\nunderstaffing, insufficient equipment and insufficient funding. There is a widespread shortage of\nqualified, tertiary-educated professionals, as well as specialised staff in areas such as climate change and\nhydrological forecasting.\n5.6.4. Systematic Observation - Coastal and Marine Areas\nGuinea-Bissau's coastal areas are strategically important for the country, not only because of their\necological value – which is home to ecosystems such as mangroves, estuaries and islands – but also\nbecause of their economic and social importance, as they are home to fishing communities, agricultural\nactivities and urban infrastructure. However, these areas are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate\nchange, in particular rising sea levels, coastal erosion and saline intrusion, which threaten both\necosystems and the livelihoods of coastal populations.\nIn recent years, with the support of international partners, Guinea-Bissau has made important progress\nin introducing modern technologies for coastal observation and monitoring. The WACA Project (West\nAfrican Coastal Areas) has played a central role in this process, promoting the use of:\n\nRemote sensors for large-scale data collection and difficult to access;\n\nDrones, which capture high-resolution images and monitor coastal development;\n\nGeographic Information Systems (GIS), which facilitate spatial analysis, modelling of erosion\nscenarios and identification of risk areas.\nThese tools have helped to map vulnerable areas, support land-use planning, and provide the scientific\nbasis for coastal adaptation measures, including projects to restore mangrove ecosystems and define\nprotection strategies for exposed communities.\nDespite these advances, the country still lacks an integrated national coastal monitoring system. Existing\ninitiatives operate mainly under specific projects of limited duration and are not fully coordinated\nbetween national institutions such as the National Institute for the Environment (INA), the Institute for\nBiodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP), the Directorate-General for Water Resources and other\nrelevant entities. This fragmentation compromises the continuity and sustainability of data collection and\nmanagement, making it difficult to create consistent time series and implement evidence-based public\npolicies.\nThus, the actual state of systematic observation in Guinea-Bissau's coastal and marine areas can be\ndescribed as a scenario of isolated technological advances, with a positive impact on knowledge\ngeneration and risk awareness, but still lacking an institutionalised and integrated structure that ensures\ncontinuous monitoring, data sharing and coordination between sectors.\nTo address these gaps, it is essential to invest in the creation of an integrated national coastal monitoring\nsystem that coordinates the different institutions, ensures data interoperability and ensures the continuity\nof observations in the long term.\nGuinea-Bissau's coastal areas, particularly vulnerable to erosion, sea level rise and saline intrusion, rely\non observation networks based on remote sensors, remote sensing, drones and GIS. These systems allow\nto map the coastline, monitor changes in mangrove habitat and assess the impacts of extreme weather\n\n141\n\nevents. Projects such as WACA (West Africa Coastal Areas) have promoted the integration of this data\ninto digital platforms to support decision-making and territorial planning.\n5.6.4. Systematic Observation - Biodiversity and Ecosystems\nGuinea-Bissau is renowned for its extraordinary biological wealth, hosting vast ecosystems of\nmangroves, savannas, dry forests, wetlands and islands that constitute habitats of global importance for\nendangered species, migratory birds and fisheries resources. The Institute of Biodiversity and Protected\nAreas (IBAP) plays a central role in the conservation and monitoring of this diversity, managing\nprotected areas that cover approximately 26% of the country's territory, including the Orango National\nPark, the João Vieira and Poilão National Park and the Lagoas de Cufada Natural Park, among others.\nIn recent years, IBAP and its partners have implemented modern tools and methods of environmental\nmonitoring, complementing the fieldwork carried out by technical teams and local communities. Among\nthe instruments currently used are:\n\nSatellite and drone imagery to monitor land use dynamics, mangrove areas evolution and\nidentification of areas at risk of degradation;\n\ncamera traps installed in strategic areas, which allow the collection of data on flagship species\nand the assessment of the abundance and distribution of terrestrial fauna;\n\nField inventories: regular surveys, carried out in collaboration with communities and researchers,\nto assess the floristic and faunal composition, as well as the conservation status of specific\nhabitats.\nThese efforts have contributed to strengthen scientific knowledge about national biodiversity, support\ndecision-making on conservation and give greater international visibility to the ecological importance of\nGuinea-Bissau, especially within the Biosphere Reserve of the Bijagós Archipelago, recognised by\nUNESCO.\nHowever, monitoring biodiversity and ecosystems still faces structural challenges that limit their\neffectiveness:\n\nLack of systematisation: data collection initiatives are often fragmented and dependent on shortterm projects, making it difficult to create continuous time series.\n\nLimited database integration: there is still no unified national platform that centralises, organises\nand makes information available in an accessible and interoperable way.\n\nInsufficient linkage with regional and international networks: although there is some\ncollaboration with cross-border conservation organisations and international observatories, full\nintegration into global monitoring systems is still at an early stage.\nThus, the actual state of systematic observation of biodiversity and ecosystems is characterised by a set\nof relevant and innovative initiatives, but which require greater coordination, continuity and integration.\nThe consolidation of a national biodiversity monitoring system, supported by interoperable digital\ndatabases and cooperation with international networks, is essential to ensure the sustainable management\nof Guinea-Bissau's natural capital and to position the country as an active actor in global biodiversity\nconservation.\n\n142\n\nThe consolidation of systematic observation and research networks is an essential step for Guinea-Bissau,\nallowing anticipation of impacts, support for vulnerable communities, strengthening adaptation policies\nand integrating the country into regional and global climate monitoring networks.\n\n143\n\nTable 5-0-3:Systematic Research and Observation Networks in Guinea-Bissau\nSector / Network\nType\nCurrent\nCharacteristics\nGaps\nCauses\nPriority\nmeasures\nStrategic\nPartners\nMeteorology and\nClimatology\n07 synoptic\nstations (3\npartially\noperational);

Gender and Climate Change\nAlthough not explicitly addressed in Decision 17/CP. 8, it is recommended to include a sixth sub-chapter\non gender and climate change.\nThis sub-chapter addresses the following main points: 1. Current situation of gender consideration in\nGuinea-Bissau; 2. Impact of climate change on gender; 3rd Women’s contribution to mitigation and\nadaptation activities; and 4. Recommendations to strengthen gender mainstreaming in climate action.\n5.7.1. The actual situation of gender consideration in Guinea-Bissau\nGuinea-Bissau has increasingly recognised the importance of gender mainstreaming in national\ndevelopment policies and programmes, including in the areas of environment and climate change.\na) National institutions and civil society organisations\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the promotion of gender equality and women's empowerment are directly linked to\nclimate and environmental action, reflecting the growing awareness of the need to integrate the gender\ndimension into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.\n- The Institute for Women and Children (IMC) is the main government entity responsible for these issues.\nIn addition to promoting equal opportunities and female empowerment, BMI monitors environmental\nand climate initiatives, ensuring that policies and programmes take into account the specific needs of\nwomen and children, especially in communities most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.\n- The Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC) plays a central role in the\nimplementation of adaptation and mitigation programmes. In recent years, it has sought to integrate the\ngender dimension into Community projects, with a particular emphasis on initiatives for coastal\nadaptation and sustainable management of natural resources. This approach aims to ensure that women\nparticipate actively in decision-making, benefit from introduced technologies, and contribute to the\nresilience of their communities.\nAt the same time, civil society organisations have played an active role on the ground. The Women’s\nNetwork, women’s community associations and other local organisations contribute to social\nmobilisation by promoting sustainable natural resource management practices, empowering women for\n\n145\n\nclimate adaptation initiatives, and advocating for women’s rights in vulnerable contexts. These\norganisations act as bridges between national policies and local communities, ensuring effective female\nparticipation and that climate projects respond to specific social and cultural realities.\nTogether, these national institutions and civil society organisations form a complementary system of\ngovernance and community action, essential to promote gender equality, strengthen climate resilience\nand the sustainable implementation of environmental policies in Guinea-Bissau.\nb) National policies, strategies and initiatives\nGuinea-Bissau incorporates the gender dimension in climate policies through instruments such as the\nNational Plan for Gender Equality and the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PANA),\nwhich emphasise the need to consider gender inequalities in climate planning.\nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy and National Environmental Policy recognise the central role\nof women in food security, subsistence agriculture, and ecosystem protection.\nAt the international level, the country has signed commitments under the UNFCCC and the 2030 Agenda\n(SDG 5 and SDG 13), promoting gender mainstreaming in its national contributions to climate action.\nc) Examples of activities already carried out\nIn Guinea-Bissau, several initiatives have been developed to integrate the gender dimension in climate\nchange adaptation and mitigation efforts. These include awareness-raising campaigns promoted by\nNGOs and the Institute for Women and Children (IMC), which include workshops, community debates\nand educational activities to raise awareness of the effects of climate change on women and local\ncommunities.\nCommunity-based training programmes focussing on resilient agriculture, water management, and\nreforestation techniques were also implemented, with special attention to the active participation of rural\nwomen, strengthening their capacity to respond to extreme weather events.\nMeanwhile, coastal adaptation and mangrove restoration projects incorporate the training of women's\ngroups in the sustainable management of natural resources, promoting female leadership in the protection\nand conservation of coastal ecosystems.\nMoreover, microcredit and green entrepreneurship initiatives have encouraged women to develop small\nincome-generating activities linked to sustainable practices, such as solar fish drying or climate-friendly\nhorticulture, while contributing to food security, income generation, and community resilience.\nThis set of activities demonstrates the importance of integrating a gender perspective into climate\npolicies, recognising the central role of women in adapting to climate change and promoting sustainable\nsolutions in the country.\nTable 5-0-4:Gender Situation in Guinea-Bissau\nInstitutions\nPolicies\nActivities\nGaps\nOpportunities /\nPartners\n\n146\n\nInstitute for Women\nand Children (IMC)\nNational Plan for\nGender Equality\nGender and climate\nchange awareness\ncampaigns; training\nfor women in rural\ncommunities\nLimited technical\nand financial\ncapacity; restricted\ngeographical scope\nUN Women,\nUNICEF, NGO\nWomen, MABAC\nMinistry of\nEnvironment,\nBiodiversity and\nClimate Action\n(MABAC)\nNational Policy on\nAdaptation to\nClimate Change\n(PANA); National\nEnvironmental\nPolicy\nGender\nmainstreaming in\ncommunity and\ncoastal adaptation\nprojects\nLack of\nsystematisation of\ngender\nmainstreaming in all\nprogrammes;\ninsufficient data\nbroken down by\ngender\nUNDP, GEF, local\ncommunities, IBAP\nCivil society\norganisations (e.g.\nWomen's Network,\nCommunity\nWomen's\nAssociations)\nInternal guidelines\nfor socioenvironmental\nparticipation\nCommunity\nmobilisation,\ntraining in resilient\nagriculture and\nnatural resource\nmanagement\nFragmentation of\ninitiatives; lack of\ncoordination with\npublic policies\nInternational and\nregional NGOs,\nbilateral partners,\nrural women's\nnetworks\nSectoral Ministries\n(Agriculture, Water,\nHealth)\nNational Poverty\nReduction Strategy,\nSectoral Gender\nMainstreaming Plans\nImplementation of\npilot projects\nfocussing on women,\nmicro-credit\nprogrammes and\ngreen\nentrepreneurship\nLow intersectoral\nintegration; few\ngender monitoring\nindicators\nFAO, World Bank,\nCooperation\n5.7.2. Impact of climate change on gender\nClimate change does not affect men and women in the same way. In Guinea-Bissau, women are\nparticularly exposed and vulnerable due to their central role in agriculture, water collection and\nmanagement, conservation of natural resources and ensuring family food security. This vulnerability is\nmost pronounced in rural and coastal areas, where living conditions depend heavily on ecosystems and\nclimate variability.\na) Increased vulnerability of women\nIn Guinea-Bissau, women face specific and marked vulnerabilities due to climate change, reflecting the\ninteraction between social, economic and environmental factors.\nIn agriculture and food security, most women engage in subsistence farming, including rice cultivation,\nhorticulture, and harvesting of non-woody forest products. Irregular rainfall, prolonged droughts and\nsalinisation of coastal soils directly affect agricultural production, compromising the main source of\nincome and livelihood for many families.\nAccess to water is another crucial factor, given that women are traditionally responsible for collecting\nand managing water at home. The scarcity or contamination of sources increases the time and effort\nrequired for this activity, reducing the time available for education, health and other productive activities.\nIn the management of natural resources, women play a central role in the collection of firewood and the\nuse of forest products. The degradation of ecosystems increases the pressure on resources, forcing women\n\n147\n\nto travel longer distances and exposing them to physical and social risks, including accidents and\ninsecurity.\nIn coastal areas, women who depend on fishing and fish processing face additional challenges due to\ncoastal erosion, rising sea levels and depletion of marine resources, compromising food security and\nlivelihoods in these communities.\nTaken together, these factors highlight the need for gender-sensitive climate policies and programmes\nthat recognise and respond to women’s specific vulnerabilities, strengthening their resilience and active\nparticipation in adapting to climate change.\nb) Gender inequalities exacerbating climate impacts\nGender inequalities in Guinea-Bissau amplify the effects of climate change on women, limiting their\nability to adapt and increasing their exposure to risk.\nLimited access to productive resources is a significant barrier: many women lack formal land rights or\naccess to credit, which limits their ability to invest in resilient farming techniques or small greeneconomy businesses.\nLow participation in decision-making also contributes to vulnerability: women continue to be underrepresented in natural resource governance and management bodies, making it difficult to integrate their\nneeds and priorities into climate adaptation plans.\nInequality in education and training further aggravates this situation. Low rates of female literacy reduce\naccess to information on climate risks, adaptation technologies, and climate finance opportunities,\nlimiting women’s autonomy and agency.\nFinally, climate change has a direct impact on health, increasing the incidence of waterborne and vectorborne diseases such as malaria and diarrhoea, particularly affecting women and children, who play the\nrole of primary caregivers at home.\nThese inequalities highlight the need for gender-sensitive climate interventions that promote equitable\naccess to resources, participation in decision-making, technical training, and protection of women’s\nhealth.\nc) Social and economic consequences\nClimate change has significant social and economic impacts on women in Guinea-Bissau, reinforcing\npre-existing inequalities and affecting the resilience of communities.\nWork overload increases in climate stress contexts, as women take on greater responsibilities in\nagriculture, water management, family care, and productive activities, which reinforces existing\ninequalities.\nStructural constraints, such as restricted access to productive resources, credit, and training, reduce\nwomen’s resilience, directly affecting the resilience of entire communities, given women’s strategic role\nin food production, health, and family well-being.\n\n148\n\nIn extreme climate crises, such as floods, prolonged droughts or population displacement, women and\ngirls face higher risks of gender-based violence, social exclusion, and loss of livelihoods, making them\nparticularly vulnerable and requiring specific attention in adaptation and social protection policies.\nThese consequences underscore the importance of gender-sensitive climate strategies that strengthen the\nprotection, empowerment, and participation of women in community resilience.\nTable 5-0-5:Differentiated impacts of climate change on gender in Guinea-Bissau\nDifferentiated impacts\nCritical areas\nExamples in GuineaBissau\nSocial/economic\nconsequences\nReducing agricultural\nproduction and food\nsecurity\nSubsistence agriculture\nand horticulture\nLoss of rice crops in\nBologna due to salinisation\nand irregular rainfall\nFood insecurity; increasing\nfemale poverty; lower\nhousehold income\nIncreased effort to collect\nwater\nAccess and water\nmanagement\nLack of reliable sources in\nBafatá, Gabú and Oio;\nwell drought during dry\nseason\nIncreasing women's\nworkload; less time for\neducation and productive\nactivities\nPressure on natural\nresources\nForests and domestic\nenergy\nGreater distance for the\ncollection of firewood and\nforest products in Quinara\nand Tombali\nPhysical fatigue; risk of\nviolence; less time\navailable for economic\nactivities\nEffects of coastal erosion\nand sea level rise\nCoastal areas and artisanal\nfisheries\nLoss of fish processing\nareas in coastal\ncommunities (Bijagós,\nCaió, Varela)\nLoss of income; greater\neconomic vulnerability of\nwomen fishermen and\nprocessors\nLimitations on access to\nland and credit\nLand rights and financing\nLittle formal land\nownership by women\nfarmers\nFailure to invest in\nresilient farming practices\nand economic\ndiversification\nUnder-representation in\ndecision-making processes\nPolitical and Community\nparticipation\nLow presence of women in\nnatural resources\nmanagement committees\nSpecific needs not\nconsidered in adaptation\nplans; perpetuation of\ninequalities\nVulnerability in health and\nfamily care\nPublic health and climatesensitive diseases\nIncreased malaria and\ndiarrhoea during periods of\nflooding\nThe burden of women as\ncaregivers; greater impact\non children's health\nIncreased social risks in\nclimate crises\nDisplacement, extreme\npoverty and violence\nVulnerability during\nprolonged floods and\ndroughts\nIncreased exposure to\ngender-based violence;\nsocial exclusion;\nweakening community\nresilience\n\n5.7.3. Women's contribution to mitigation and adaptation activities\nWomen in Guinea-Bissau play a central and multifaceted role in climate change mitigation and\nadaptation activities, assuming essential responsibilities in the sustainable management of natural\nresources, biodiversity conservation, resilient agriculture and the transmission of traditional knowledge\nto communities.\na) Sustainable management of natural resources and conservation of biodiversity\nIn Guinea-Bissau, women play a central role in the sustainable management of natural resources and the\nconservation of biodiversity. They actively participate in the collection, planting and care of native\n\n149\n\nspecies, in the maintenance of community gardens and in the management of small local reserves,\ncontributing to food security and the preservation of ecosystems.\nMoreover, women are involved in the conservation of mangroves and coastal areas, which are essential\nfor protecting communities from erosion and rising sea levels, and for maintaining marine and terrestrial\nbiodiversity. Through women’s community associations, they monitor forest and water resources,\npromoting sustainable use practices and ensuring the preservation of ecosystems for future generations.\nThis engagement highlights the strategic role of women in implementing local climate change adaptation\nsolutions and promoting environmental and community resilience.\nb) Climate-resilient agriculture\nIn Guinea-Bissau, women play a central role in subsistence farming, applying traditional and innovative\ntechniques to address climate variability. Among these practices, we highlight the use of droughtresistant seeds and the implementation of community irrigation systems, which help to maintain\nagricultural production even in periods of water scarcity.\nMoreover, women are actively participating in sustainable agriculture and food security programmes,\noften linked to projects funded by international organisations and NGOs. Their work not only ensures\nfamilies’ resilience, but also strengthens rural communities, strengthening local capacity to adapt to\nclimate change.\nc) Participation in Community projects and environmental initiatives\nWomen in Guinea-Bissau play an active role in community projects and environmental initiatives,\ncontributing significantly to climate adaptation and local sustainability. They participate in reforestation,\nfruit tree planting and mangrove restoration, supporting carbon sequestration and the protection of\nvulnerable ecosystems.\nThey are also involved in renewable energy projects, including the installation and maintenance of solar\nmini-grids, promoting access to clean energy in rural communities, and strengthening local energy\nresilience.\nWomen also excel as leaders in environmental awareness, organising workshops, campaigns and\neducational events that disseminate sustainable practices and climate warnings, strengthening\ncommunity knowledge and responsiveness to the impacts of climate change.\nd) Women's transformative potential\nIn Guinea-Bissau, women play a transformative role in their communities, acting as leaders and agents\nof change. They are catalysts for adopting climate resilience practices, mobilising other community\nmembers and influencing local decisions related to the adaptation and management of natural resources.\nWomen’s traditional knowledge, combined with modern practices, enables the development of integrated\nadaptive solutions, increasing collective resilience and strengthening social cohesion in the face of\nclimate threats.\n\n150\n\nThe active participation of women in mitigation and adaptation strategies contributes directly to the\nreduction of vulnerabilities, the strengthening of communities’ capacity to respond and their preparation\nto face extreme climate events, consolidating their role as protagonists of environmental and social\ntransformation.\nTable 5-0-6: Women's contribution to mitigation and adaptation activities\nDimension /\nArea\nContribution of\nwomen\nConcrete\nexamples in\nGuinea-Bissau\nImpacts\nGaps\nStrategic\nPartners\nManagement of\nnatural resources\nand biodiversity\nMonitoring,\npreservation and\nsustainable use\nof forest and\nwater resources\nProtection of\nmangroves,\nmanagement of\ncommunity\ngardens,\nmaintenance of\nsmall local\nreserves\nEcosystem\nconservation,\ncoastal\nprotection,\nenvironmental\nresilience\nLimited\nresources; little\nsystematisation\nof practices;\nneed for\ntechnical training\nIBAP, MABAC,\nenvironmental\nNGOs, local\ncommunities\nClimate-resilient\nagriculture\nImplementation\nof adaptive and\nsustainable\nfarming\ntechniques\nUse of droughtresistant\nseeds,\ncommunity\nirrigation\nsystems, food\nsecurity\nprogrammes\nEnsure\nlivelihoods,\nincrease family\nand\ncommunity\nproductivity\nand resilience\nLimited access to\nmodern finance\nand\ntechnologies\nMinistry of\nAgriculture,\nFAO, UNDP,\nlocal NGOs\nCommunity\nprojects and\nenvironmental\nactions\nParticipation in\nreforestation,\nmangrove\nrestoration,\nrenewable\nenergy and\nenvironmental\nawareness\nPlanting fruit\ntrees,\nmaintenance of\nsolar mini-grids,\nworkshops and\neducational\ncampaigns\nCarbon\nsequestration,\nimproving\ncommunity\ninfrastructure,\nraising\nenvironmental\nawareness\nLimited\ngeographic\ncoverage; lack of\nscale and\ncoordination\nGEF, UNDP,\nWACA and\ncoastal projects,\nlocal\ncommunities\nCommunity\nleadership and\nknowledge\ntransfer\nAgents of\nchange,\nmobilisers of\nresilient\npractices,\ntransmitters of\ntraditional\nknowledge\nLeadership in\nlocal\ncommittees,\nmentoring of\nyouth and other\ncommunity\nmembers\nStrengthening\ncommunity\nresilience, social\ncohesion and\ndissemination of\nadaptive\npractices\nFormal underrepresentation in\ndecision-making\nbodies; need for\ninstitutional\nrecognition\nWomen's NGOs,\nIMC, MABAC,\nUNICEF, CF4CWA\n\n5.7.4. Recommendations for strengthening gender mainstreaming in climate action\nEffective gender mainstreaming in climate change policies and programmes in Guinea-Bissau requires\nstructured and systematic actions. Key recommendations include:\na) Strengthening the institutionalisation of the gender perspective\nIn Guinea-Bissau, strengthening the institutionalisation of the gender perspective in climate policies aims\nto ensure that differentiated vulnerability and the role of women are systematically integrated into all\nmitigation and adaptation strategies.\n\n151\n\nTo this end, it is essential to formally incorporate the gender dimension into national climate change\npolicies, plans and programmes, ensuring that all sectors recognise the specific needs of women and\npromote their active participation.\nIn addition, the creation of institutional monitoring mechanisms allows the implementation of a gender\nperspective in sustainable development and climate adaptation projects, ensuring that the actions\nimplemented have a real impact on reducing inequalities and strengthening the resilience of communities.\nb) Ensure gender-disaggregated data\nIn Guinea-Bissau, ensuring gender-disaggregated data is crucial to understanding the differentiated\nimpacts of climate change and guiding inclusive policies.\nTo this end, systems for collecting and analysing gender-disaggregated climate and socioeconomic data\nare developed, enabling the precise identification of how women and men are affected differently by\nclimate risks.\nThese data serve as a basis for the formulation of adaptation and mitigation policies, plans and\nprogrammes that effectively respond to the needs of all social groups, promoting equity, inclusion and\nstrengthening community resilience.\nc) Specific training and qualifications\nIn Guinea-Bissau, training and capacity building specific to women and girls is essential to strengthen\ntheir participation in climate change responses. Education and training programmes are promoted in areas\nsuch as science, technology, risk management and resilient agricultural practices, with the aim of\nexpanding technical knowledge and capacity for action.\nIn addition, the creation of knowledge networks and the exchange of experiences is encouraged, allowing\nwomen to become agents of innovation and local adaptation, capable of implementing practical and\neffective solutions to address climate challenges in their communities.\n\nd) Access to finance and technologies\nIn Guinea-Bissau, access to finance and technology is critical to strengthening women’s resilience to\nclimate change. Climate funds, microcredit, and productive resources must be facilitated, enabling\nwomen to implement adaptive solutions in vulnerable communities.\nAt the same time, the use of clean and renewable technologies is encouraged, ensuring that women can\nadopt more efficient mitigation and adaptation practices, contributing to environmental sustainability,\nlocal economic development and reducing gender inequalities.\ne) Active participation in decision-making\n\n152\n\nIn Guinea-Bissau, the active participation of women in decision-making processes is essential to ensure\nthat climate policies reflect the needs and experiences of all social groups. It is crucial that women’s and\nyouth organisations participate in national and international forums on climate change, contributing their\nperspectives to policymaking and strategies.\nMoreover, representation and consultation mechanisms should be promoted, enabling women to\ninfluence decisions related to natural resource management, sustainable development and climate\nadaptation measures, enhancing gender equity and the effectiveness of climate action in the country.\nThese recommendations aim to strengthen gender equity, increase community resilience and ensure that\nwomen contribute fully to climate change mitigation and adaptation in Guinea-Bissau.\nTable 5-0-7: Recommendations to strengthen gender mainstreaming in climate action\nRecommended\nAction\nGoal\nExpected impact\nCurrent Gaps\nStrategic Partners\nStrengthening\ngender\ninstitutionalisation\nin climate policies,\nplans and\nprogrammes\nEnsure that the\ngender dimension\nis systematically\nconsidered\nGreater inclusion\nof women in\nmitigation and\nadaptation\nstrategies; more\nequitable policies\nLack of formal\nmechanisms and\nintersectoral\nintegration\nMABAC, BMI,\nNGO women,\nUNDP, GEF\nEnsure data broken\ndown by gender\nImproving climate\nimpact analysis\nand guiding\ninclusive policies\nEvidence-based\npolicy decisions;\nmaking climate\naction more\neffective\nInsufficient data\ncollection systems;\nincomplete data\nINE, MABAC,\nuniversities,\ninternational\ntechnical partners\nPromoting training\nand capacity\nbuilding for\nwomen and girls in\nthe fields of\nclimate, science\nand technology\nBoosting female\nleadership skills\nand capacities\nWomen able to act\nas agents of\nchange; local\ninnovation in\nadaptation\nLimited access to\ntechnical and\nscientific\neducation; social\nand cultural\nbarriers\nEducation NGO,\nUNICEF,\nuniversities, IMC\nFacilitating\nwomen’s access to\nfinance, productive\nresources, and\nclean technologies\nEconomic and\ntechnical\nempowerment of\nwomen\nGreater\nimplementation of\nadaptive solutions;\nstrengthening\ncommunity\nresilience\nRestricted access\nto funds and\ntechnologies; lack\nof specific\nprogrammes\nMicrocredit Banks,\nGEF, UNDP,\nInternational\nCooperation, Local\nNGOs\nEncouraging active\nparticipation in\ndecision-making\nprocesses\nIntegrating\nWomen’s\nPerspectives on\nClimate\nGovernance\nMore inclusive\npolicies;\nstrengthening\nfemale\nrepresentation\nUnderrepresentation in\nfora and decisionmaking bodies\nIMC, women’s\nNGOs, community\ncommittees,\ninternational\npartners\n5.8. Synergies with other Environmental Conventions\nGuinea-Bissau, as a State Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), recognised the importance of coordinating its climate action with other multilateral\nenvironmental conventions to which it is also a signatory, namely:\n\n153\n\n\nConvention on Biological Diversity (CBD);\n\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD);\n\nRamsar Convention on wetlands of international importance;\n\nBasel, Stockholm and Rotterdam Convention on hazardous chemicals and waste.\nThis coordination is considered essential to ensure coherence, maximise the use of limited resources and\navoid duplication of effort.\n5.8.1. Institutional integration and coordination\nThe Ministry of Environment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC) coordinates the\nimplementation of environmental conventions in close collaboration with relevant national institutes and\nagencies such as the Institute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP), the Competent Authority for\nEnvironmental Assessment (AAAC), the Centre for Waste and Chemicals (CRPQ) and the DirectorateGeneral for Water Resources (DGRH). Despite progress, there is still an urgent need to strengthen\ninterinstitutional coordination mechanisms and to ensure that national strategies are integrated across\nsectors.\n5.8.2. Ongoing practical synergies\n1. Climate and biodiversity (UNFCCC-CBD):\nMangrove conservation, reforestation and protected area management projects contribute to climate\nchange mitigation and adaptation while enhancing biodiversity preservation. The Coastal Project and the\nWACA Project are examples of initiatives that combine the protection of coastal ecosystems with climate\nresilience.\n2, Climate and Desertification (UNFCCC – UNCCD):\nAgroforestry, assisted natural regeneration and sustainable agricultural practices help to reduce soil\ndegradation and improve the adaptability of rural communities. Pilot projects in Bafatá and Gabú have\nshown positive results in combating erosion and restoring soil fertility.\n3. Climate and Wetlands (UNFCCC – Ramsar):\nThe integrated management of Ramsar sites, such as the Bolama-Bijagós archipelagos, has enabled the\nalignment of conservation objectives with coastal adaptation measures, which are essential to deal with\nrising sea levels and saline intrusion.\n4. Climate and Waste and Chemical Management (UNFCCC – Basel, Stockholm and Rotterdam\nConventions):\nCRPQ’s solid and hazardous chemical waste management initiatives reduce pollution and indirectly\ncontribute to climate mitigation, avoiding harmful gas emissions while protecting public health and\nbiodiversity.\n5.8.3. Gaps identified\n\n154\n\nThe implementation of policies related to climate change and gender equality faces significant structural\nand institutional challenges. One of the main shortcomings is the lack of a permanent national interinstitutional coordination mechanism, which makes it difficult to coordinate effectively between the focal\npoints of the various environmental and climate conventions. This lack of coordination undermines the\nintegration of actions and reduces the efficiency of the implementation of policies and action plans.\nAvailable financial and human resources are still limited, limiting the country’s ability to implement\nintegrated, sustainable, and large-scale interventions. The lack of qualified personnel and specialised\ntechnical support makes it difficult, for example, to draw up harmonised greenhouse gas inventories and\nproduce joint reports, limiting the country's ability to fully comply with international commitments.\nMoreover, there is a weak link between sectoral policies, such as agriculture, energy, fisheries, and urban\nplanning, and internationally agreed environmental commitments. This gap compromises the coherence\nof mitigation and adaptation strategies, reducing the potential impact of the initiatives implemented.\nIn short, while there is growing awareness of the need for integrated climate policies, Guinea-Bissau\nfaces structural and capacity-building challenges that require coordinated solutions, adequate resources\nand technical reinforcement to ensure the effectiveness of environmental and climate actions in the\ncountry.\n5.8.4. Priority measures\nThe creation of synergies between different environmental conventions is a strategic priority for GuineaBissau, aiming at strengthening the governance and effectiveness of environmental policies. In this sense,\na key initiative is the creation of a National Committee on Environmental Synergies, created to regularly\nbring together the focal points of each convention and ensure the coherent integration of international\nguidelines into national policies and strategies.\nAnother priority is to promote integrated action plans, leveraging natural intersections between areas\nsuch as biodiversity, climate change, desertification, and waste management. This approach allows us to\noptimise resources, align objectives and implement more consistent and impactful interventions.\nRegional and international cooperation is also essential to strengthen these synergies. Participation in\ninitiatives of ECOWAS, the African Union and the South-South Partnership facilitates the exchange of\nexperiences, best practices and technical knowledge, contributing to solutions adapted to the national and\nregional context.\nFinally, mobilising climate and environmental finance must be coordinated and multidimensional, so as\nto avoid overlapping projects and maximise the outcomes of interventions. The combination of these\nmeasures will enable Guinea-Bissau to move towards integrated and efficient environmental\nmanagement in line with international commitments, while strengthening the country's resilience to\nenvironmental and climate challenges.\n5.8.5. Future perspective\nGiven its rich biodiversity and climate vulnerability, Guinea-Bissau is uniquely positioned to adopt an\nintegrated approach that enhances its socio-economic and environmental resilience. The synergy between\nenvironmental conventions should not be seen only as an international obligation, but as a national\n\n155\n\nsustainable development strategy capable of aligning global commitments with local priorities for\nadaptation, mitigation and conservation.\nTable 5-0-8:Synergies with other environmental conventions in Guinea-Bissau\nAxis of Synergy\nCurrent Situation\nGaps\nPriority measures\nStrategic Partners\nClimate – Biodiversity\n(UNFCCC and CBD)\nActive participation in\nbiodiversity\nconservation\ninitiatives (IBAP,\nprotected areas).\nProjects integrating\necosystem-based\nmitigation and\nadaptation.\nPoor\ninstitutional\ncoordination\nbetween\nUNFCCC and\nCBD focal\npoints.

Other relevant initiatives and information from Guinea-Bissau\nIn recent years, Guinea-Bissau has developed several initiatives that complement its obligations under\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), strengthening its climate\nresilience, promoting sustainable development and strengthening international cooperation. These\ninitiatives, although often small-scale, are important in consolidating experiences and laying the\nfoundations for future structural programmes.\na) Complementary national plans and strategies\nA number of complementary initiatives and policy instruments have been developed to support the\nimplementation of environmental and climate policies, strengthening the country's capacity to address\nclimate change challenges in an integrated manner.\nThe National Adaptation Plan (NAP) is currently in the operational phase and is one of the main\ninstruments guiding investments in sectoral adaptation. The plan focuses on priority areas such as\nagriculture, water, health and coastal areas, setting out specific measures to increase the resilience of\nvulnerable communities and ecosystems.\nAt the same time, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans (NBSAPs) seek to integrate\nconcerns about nature conservation, sustainable use of resources and ecosystem adaptation. This strategy\nworks in synergy with the climate agenda, ensuring that biodiversity conservation actions contribute to\nboth climate change mitigation and adaptation.\nIn the energy sector, the Renewable Energy Sector Plans focus on the expansion of solar energy and the\nimplementation of community mini-grids, aiming to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and,\nconsequently, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These initiatives not only contribute to climate change\nmitigation, but also promote access to sustainable energy in rural areas and isolated communities.\nTaken together, these national plans and strategies reflect a growing effort by Guinea-Bissau to align\nsustainable development, environmental conservation and climate adaptation, creating a structured basis\nfor integrated and long-term interventions.\nb) Ongoing projects and programmes\nSeveral ongoing projects and programmes have made significant contributions to climate change adaptation,\nmitigating risks and promoting sustainable development.\nThe WACA (West African Coastal Areas) Project supports integrated coastal zone protection and\nmanagement with the aim of reducing erosion and mitigating the impacts of climate change on coastal\ncommunities and vulnerable ecosystems.\nThe Coastal Project, funded by GEF and implemented by UNDP, focuses on restoration of degraded\nmangroves, community capacity building and hydro-meteorological monitoring. This project combines\n\n157\n\nscientific knowledge and traditional wisdom to promote sustainable coastal management practices and\nincrease the resilience of local populations.\nIn the energy field, the Mini-Solar Project aims to expand access to clean energy in rural communities,\nreducing dependence on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable energy solutions.\nThe Early Warning Project focuses on the installation of hydro-meteorological stations and the\nstrengthening of the national capacity to respond to climate risks, contributing to the preparation and\nmitigation of natural disasters.\nIn addition, community reforestation initiatives have been implemented in various regions of the country,\nwith the active participation of communities and NGOs. These actions support carbon sequestration,\nbiodiversity conservation and livelihood building, while strengthening local adaptation to climate\nchange.\nCollectively, these projects and programmes reflect an integrated and multidimensional effort by GuineaBissau to address environmental and climate challenges by aligning sustainable development,\nenvironmental protection and community inclusion.\nd) Participation in regional and international initiatives\nGuinea-Bissau has been actively involved in several regional and international initiatives, enhancing\ncooperation and exchange of experiences on environmental and climate issues. Within the CPLP\n(Community of Portuguese Language Countries), the country has a significant involvement in\nenvironmental forums, with emphasis on its participation in the 10th Ministerial Meeting on the\nEnvironment (2025), where joint policies and strategies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change\nare discussed.\nAt the regional level, ECOWAS and OMVG have provided spaces for cooperation in the management\nof cross-border water resources and the promotion of renewable energy, allowing for policy alignment\nand the exploitation of synergies between neighbouring countries.\nIn the field of coastal and marine conservation, the Regional Partnership for Coastal and Marine\nConservation (RPCM) has been an important tool for strengthening the protection of marine biodiversity,\npromoting coordinated actions based on scientific evidence.\nIn addition, Guinea-Bissau has exploited emerging opportunities through the Climate Fund for Children\nin West Africa (CF4C-WA), which enables resource mobilisation and development of projects targeting\nchildren and youth, promoting environmental education, community resilience and the involvement of\nnew generations in the climate agenda.\nThese participations demonstrate the country's commitment to international and regional cooperation,\nfostering the exchange of experiences, institutional strengthening and access to finance and technologies\nthat contribute to the implementation of national environmental and climate policies.\nd) Additional relevant information\n\n158\n\nGuinea-Bissau has intensified efforts to strengthen its institutional and technical capacity in the field of\nclimate change and environmental management. In this context, the implementation of training and\nawareness programmes aimed at national technicians stands out, focussing on the elaboration of\nemissions inventories, the development of climate scenarios and the application of IPCC methodologies.\nThese actions aim not only to improve the quality and reliability of data produced at national level, but\nalso to consolidate local capacities for continuous monitoring and evaluation of climate policies.\nAt the same time, the country has sought to strengthen its system of environmental statistics through\ncoordinated efforts between the National Institute of Statistics (INE) and the Ministry of Environment,\nBiodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC). This work focuses on improving the collection,\nharmonisation, and management of environmental data, ensuring that available information consistently\nsupports decision-making and the dissemination of international reports on environmental and climate\nissues.\nAnother relevant point is the increasing attention given to gender and youth integration in environmental\nand climate policies. Guinea-Bissau has implemented measures to ensure the active participation of\nwomen and young people in the design and implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation\nprogrammes, recognising the central role of these groups in building local and sustainable solutions.\nInternationally, the country has strengthened its climate diplomacy, broadening its presence in\nmultilateral negotiations and strengthening its participation in groups of vulnerable countries, such as the\nSmall Island Developing States (SIDS/LDCs) and the Alliance of Small Island Developing States\n(AOSIS).

Therefore, the national communication should reflect not only\nthe progress made but also the restrictions on its implementation, as well as the remaining needs for full\ncompliance with the obligations set out in the Convention.\nThis chapter aims to systematically present the constraints faced, the persistent gaps and the country’s\npriority needs in terms of financial, technical and institutional capacity building. obstacles encountered\nin implementing climate change mitigation and adaptation policies and measures will be analysed,\nhighlighting areas where available resources have been insufficient to ensure consistent progress.\nIn addition, particular attention will be paid to the shortcomings already identified in previous reports —\nsuch as the Second and Third National Communications, as well as the First Biennial Update Report\n(BBUR) — and to the emerging needs of ongoing climate change projects. The analysis will seek to\nhighlight both structural weaknesses and specific needs for financing, technology transfer and human\nand institutional capacity building.\nIn this way, the chapter will function as a diagnostic and guidance tool, allowing not only to understand\nthe limiting factors that condition the national response to climate change, but also to substantiate the\nrequests for international support necessary for the effective implementation of the commitments made\nby Guinea-Bissau within the UNFCCC.\n6.1. Structure for the continuous assessment and reporting of related financial, technical and\ncapacity constraints, gaps and needs, as well as the necessary and received support established.\nWithin the framework of Article 4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), Guinea-Bissau recognises the need to have an institutional and methodological framework\nto continuously assess the constraints, gaps and financial, technical and capacity needs that limit the full\nand effective implementation of its climate actions.\nTo this end, an interinstitutional coordination mechanism was established, provided by the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC), with the involvement of national focal points,\nsectoral technical institutions and development partners. This structure aims to:\n Collect, review and update information periodically on constraints and gaps in the areas of\nfinancial, technical and institutional training.\n Identify priorities and needs to support the implementation of mitigation and adaptation measures,\nin alignment with national commitments (NDC, Sector Plans, Climate Resilience Strategies).\n Facilitate transparent and systematic reporting on the support needed and received, ensuring the\ntraceability of the resources mobilised and their correspondence with the identified needs.\n\n161\n\n Promote coherence and integration with other international reporting mechanisms, including the\nBiennial Transparency Report (BTR), National Communications and Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDG) reports.\nThe framework also serves as a tool to support resource mobilisation, allowing expressed needs to be\npresented in a structured way to international partners, strengthening the country’s capacity to attract\nclimate finance, technical assistance, and targeted capacity-building programmes.\n6.1.1. Review and update information on related financial, technical and capacity constraints, gaps\nand needs\n\nRegular review and updating of information on financial, technical and capacity constraints, gaps and\nneeds is a key step towards strengthening the implementation of Guinea-Bissau's climate policies and\nmeasures. This process aims to ensure that strategic and operational decisions are made on the basis of\nup-to-date and accurate data, which reflect the real needs of the country.\nTo operationalise this activity, MABAC, in coordination with national focal points and sectoral technical\ninstitutions, carries out the following actions:\n1. Continuous mapping of gaps and constraints: Identification of institutional, technical and financial\nconstraints that may compromise the implementation of climate change mitigation and adaptation\nmeasures. This mapping covers both the central and regional levels and the priority sectors, ensuring an\nintegrated view of needs.\n2nd Periodic update of information: Gap and need information is reviewed regularly, incorporating\nrecent data from ongoing projects, institutional capacity assessments, industry initiative progress reports,\nand feedback from implementation partners.\n3. Classification and prioritisation of needs: Based on the data collected, identified needs are categorised\nby type (financial, technical or training) and prioritised according to urgency, potential impact and\navailability of resources.\n4. Integration into the national reporting system: The results of the review and update are systematically\nincorporated into the national reports, including the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) and the\nNational Communications, allowing traceability and transparency on the support needed and received.\n5. Feedback for resource mobilisation: Up-to-date information provides the basis for planning training\nprogrammes, requesting technical assistance and mobilising climate finance from international partners,\nensuring that available resources respond effectively to the country’s needs.\nThe NDC of Guinea-Bissau estimates that the costs of implementing the mitigation component will be\napproximately US$664 million during the period from 2021 to 2030, of which US$531 million, or 80%\nof the total investment needs, are financial support needs (conditional element of the NDC). The sectoral\nbreakdown of financial support needs is detailed in Table 90 below.\nTable 6-0-1:International financial support is required to implement the updated NDC (Mitigation\nComponent)\n\nSectors\n\nValue in millions of US dollars in 2021\nEnergy\n240\nForests and Land Use\n264\n\n162\n\nAgriculture\n22\nWaste\n5\nTOTAL\n531\n\nThe main projects identified are mostly managed by institutions under the auspices of the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Biodiversity and Climate Action (MABAC), including the Institute of Biodiversity and\nProtected Areas (IBAP), the National Institute of the Environment (INA) and the Competent Authority\nfor Environmental Assessment (AAAC). The Ministry of Energy is responsible for the main energy\nprojects, and the Bissau Municipal Council is responsible for waste management projects.\nFor the preparation of its first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1), Guinea-Bissau received from the\nGEF, through UNEP, an amount of 600,000 US dollars, for a period of 27 months (April 2023 to March\n2025).\nTable 6-0-2:Support received from GEF/UNEP for the BTR1 Project\nProject Objectives\nCost $US\ni.

Financial resources and capacity needs for the implementation of the National Global GHG\nEmission Reduction Strategy\nThe effective implementation of Guinea-Bissau's Global National Strategy for the Reduction of\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) depends on a clear understanding of the financial needs and the\ninstitutional, technical and human capacity needed to achieve the defined objectives.\nTo ensure that the Strategy is operationalised efficiently, the country carried out a detailed assessment of\nthe requirements associated with the different mitigation measures, considering:\n1. Required financial resources: Total costs of implementing priority mitigation actions, including\ninvestments in clean technologies, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable forest management\n\n163\n\nand other key sectors, have been estimated. This analysis identifies funding gaps and guides resource\nmobilisation with international partners, climate funds, and bilateral and multilateral mechanisms.\n2. Institutional and technical training needs: In addition to funding, the implementation of the Strategy\nrequires strengthening national capacity. This includes specialised training in emissions inventory and\nmonitoring, transparency reporting, developing technical skills for implementing low-carbon projects,\nand strengthening climate governance institutions.\n3. Integration with national and international instruments: Resource and capacity identification is carried\nout in close coordination with other national planning instruments, such as Sector Plans, Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (NDCs) and international reporting mechanisms, ensuring coherence between\ndifferent levels of climate action.\n4. Strategic planning and prioritisation: Based on the assessment of financial and capacity needs,\nmitigation measures are prioritised according to their potential impact on GHG emission reduction,\ntechnical feasibility, cost-effectiveness and alignment with national sustainable development goals.\nThis approach provides Guinea-Bissau with a consolidated view of resource and capacity needs,\nproviding a sound basis for mobilising financing, institution building and ongoing monitoring of the\nimplementation of the Global National GHG Emission Reduction Strategy.\n6.1.3. Cost-benefit analysis of the support requested and received\nBased on the Vulnerability and Risk Assessment (V&R), Guinea-Bissau conducted a detailed costbenefit analysis to estimate the potential costs of long-term adaptation measures, with an initial focus on\nthe water and energy sectors. This analysis aims to support strategic planning, prioritisation of investment\nand mobilisation of adequate financial resources to increase the country’s resilience to the impacts of\nclimate change.\nThe main elements of this approach include:\n1. Identification of priority adaptation measures: Critical actions to ensure water and energy security,\nincluding water supply infrastructure, water resource management, renewable energy systems, energy\nefficiency and mechanisms to protect against extreme events were considered.\n2nd Estimation of potential costs: The analysis included the costs of implementation, operation and\nmaintenance of adaptation measures, assessing different investment scenarios and time horizon, ensuring\nthat the costs reflected the needs of long-term sustainable adaptation.\n3. Assessment of socio-economic and environmental benefits: The expected benefits of the measures were\nconsidered in terms of reducing vulnerabilities, protecting populations and natural resources, increasing\nthe efficiency of essential services and promoting sustainable development.\n4. Cost-benefit relationship: The study allowed to compare the costs of the measures with the expected\nbenefits, highlighting those that have a higher social, economic and environmental return, contributing\nto more informed investment decisions.\n5. Integration with support mobilisation: The results of the cost-benefit analysis serve as a basis for\nnegotiating and coordinating financial, technical and institutional support with international partners,\nensuring that the resources received respond effectively to the identified adaptation needs.\n\n164\n\nIn this way, Guinea-Bissau strengthens its capacity to plan and implement climate adaptation measures,\npromoting an efficient use of resources and the sustainable resilience of critical sectors, namely water\nand energy.\n6.1.4. Assessment of technological needs and identification of innovative solutions\nAs part of strengthening climate resilience, Guinea-Bissau conducted a detailed study to assess the\ncountry's technological needs and identify effective and innovative technological solutions. This\nevaluation initially focused on two priority sectors, water resources and agriculture, as identified and\nprioritised in the National Adaptation Plan (PANA), considering the most vulnerable sectors and still in\nneed of interventions to effectively address the adverse impacts of climate change.\nThe main objectives of the study were:\n1. Mapping of critical technological needs: Identifying gaps in monitoring, management and adaptation\nto climate change technologies in priority sectors. This includes technologies for water storage and\ndistribution, efficient irrigation, drought- and flood-resilient cultivation, and early warning and\nforecasting systems.\n2. Develop a list of innovative technological solutions: Proven emerging technological solutions have\nbeen compiled that can be implemented in the national context to increase resilience and reduce negative\nimpacts on water resources and agriculture.\n3rd Prioritisation of solutions: The identified technologies were classified according to criteria of\nrelevance, cost-effectiveness, feasibility of implementation, sustainability and replicability potential,\nensuring that resources are applied to the solutions with the greatest impact.\n4. Integration with national adaptation strategies: The results of the study were articulated with PANA\nand other national strategic instruments, serving as a reference for future projects, mobilisation of climate\nfinance and planning of technological interventions in the most vulnerable sectors.\nThis approach enables Guinea-Bissau to develop a portfolio of technological solutions tailored to its\nspecific needs and challenges, strengthening the country's capacity to address the effects of climate\nchange in an efficient, sustainable and innovative way.\n6.1.5. Update of information on financial resources, technology transfer, training and technical\nsupport received\nAs part of the continued strengthening of climate policy implementation, Guinea-Bissau has established\nmechanisms to regularly update information on financial resources, technology transfer, training and\ntechnical support received from bilateral and multilateral donors.\nThis update involves:\n1. Detailed record of support received: Compilation of information on funding mobilised, technology\ntransfer programmes, capacity building initiatives and technical assistance provided by international\npartners, including multilateral agencies, climate funds and partner governments.\n2. Monitoring the use and effectiveness of support: Assessment of how financial and technical resources\nare applied in mitigation and adaptation projects, ensuring that the support received is aligned with\nnational priorities and effectively contributes to the reduction of climate vulnerabilities.\n\n165\n\n3. Integration into national reporting systems: Updated information is incorporated into national reports,\nsuch as the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) and National Communications, promoting\ntransparency, traceability and visibility of international support received.\n4. Feedback for future mobilisation: Continuous mapping of partners’ contributions allows identifying\nfunding or capacity gaps and facilitates the formulation of new support requests, ensuring that future\nresources respond to the country’s real needs.\nThis systematic updating process reinforces coordination between government, industrial institutions and\ninternational partners, ensuring that Guinea-Bissau maximises the use of available resources, improves\nits institutional and technological capacity, and consistently advances the implementation of climate\nchange mitigation and adaptation measures.\n6.1.6. Report on financial resources, technology transfer, training and technical assistance received\nfrom multilateral donors and developed countries\nAs part of the ongoing process of monitoring and reporting international support, Guinea-Bissau has\nprepared a detailed report on the financial resources, technology transfer, training and technical\nassistance received from various multilateral and bilateral sources, including:\n Global Environment Facility (GEF)\n Green Climate Fund (GCF)\n Multilateral institutions of international cooperation\nThe report includes:\n1. Detailed inventory of support received: Records the financial resources mobilised, projects financed,\ntechnology transfers, training programmes and technical assistance for the implementation of mitigation\nand adaptation measures.\n2. Impact analysis and effectiveness of support: Assesses the practical implementation of resources and\ntechnical assistance, highlighting the results achieved in terms of institutional capacity building,\ndevelopment of climate technologies and implementation of national strategic actions.\n3. Integration with national and international reporting instruments: The compiled data feed into\nnational reports, such as the Biennial Transparency Report (BTR) and National Communications,\nensuring traceability, transparency and alignment with the reporting requirements of the Convention.\n4. Provision for future planning: Consolidated information identifies support gaps, emerging needs, and\nopportunities to mobilise additional resources, ensuring that the country’s future climate initiatives are\nsustainable, effective, and well-funded.\nThis report reinforces Guinea-Bissau’s capacity to monitor, communicate and mobilise climate\nresources, consolidating coordination among government, development partners and multilateral\ninstitutions, and ensuring that international support directly contributes to the implementation of national\npriorities for climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\n166\n\nThe training needs for the implementation of the NDC were detailed in the respective document. The\nmain training needs and a quick assessment of whether or not training support has been received are in\nthe table below.\nTable 6-0-4:Evaluation of training support\n\nNeed for training\n\nSupport received?\nInstitutional capacity building to enable Guinea-Bissau to adequately monitor the\nimplementation of NDCs across sectors.
