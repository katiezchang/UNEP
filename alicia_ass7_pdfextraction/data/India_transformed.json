These include the general categories of\nnational circumstances, institutions, legal frameworks,\nimpacts and vulnerabilities, adaptation priorities\nand barriers, adaptation goals and efforts, progress\non implementation of adaptation, monitoring and\nevaluation of adaptation, averting, minimizing\nand addressing loss and damage associated with\nclimate change impacts, cooperation, good practices,\nexperience and lessons learned. Table 4 sets out the\nspecific types of information to be included.\n3.2 What considerations are important when\npreparing an adaptation section for the biennial\ntransparency report?\nWhen considering whether and how to include\nadaptation information in their BTRs, Parties have\nsignificant flexibility in terms of:\n• Whether to include an adaptation section in their\nBTRs\n• The types of information to include\n• The ways in which they may cross-reference\nprevious documents to reduce the reporting\nburden.\nSuch flexibility requires Parties to decide by what\nmeans they will carry out their communication\nand reporting. In that regard, Parties will need to\nconsider the various purposes of reporting adaptation\ninformation and understand the roles the other\nrelevant instruments play under the Convention (see\nsection V on linkages below). This will help Parties\nSECTION\nSPECIFIC TYPES OF INFORMATION (NUMBERS IN THE TABLE CORRESPOND\nTO PARAGRAPH NUMBERS IN CHAPTER IV OF THE MPGS)\nH. Cooperation,\ngood practices,\nexperience and\nlessons learned\n116. Each Party should provide the following information, as appropriate, related to cooperation, good\npractices, experience and lessons learned:\n(a) Efforts to share information, good practices, experience and lessons learned, including as\nthey relate to: (i) Science, planning and policies relevant to adaptation; (ii) Policy innovations\nand pilot and demonstration projects; (iii) Integration of adaptation actions into planning at\ndifferent levels; (iv) Cooperation to share information and to strengthen science, institutions and\nadaptation; (v) Area, scale and types of cooperation and good practices; (vi) Improving durability\nand effectiveness of adaptation actions; (vii) Helping developing countries to identify effective\nadaptation practices, needs, priorities, and challenges and gaps in a way that is consistent with\nencouraging good practices;\n(b) Strengthening scientific research and knowledge related to: (i) Climate, including research\nand systematic observation and early warning systems, to inform climate services and decisionmaking; (ii) Vulnerability and adaptation; (iii) Monitoring and evaluation.\nI. Any other\nrelevant\ninformation\n117. Each Party may provide, as appropriate, any other information related to climate change impacts\nand adaptation under Article 7.\nTable 4 (continued)\nSpecific types of information on climate change impacts and adaptation to be included in biennial\ntransparency reports\n\n36\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nLoss and damage associated with the adverse effects\nof climate change may be related to extreme weather\nevents and slow onset events such as sea level\nrise, salinization, increasing temperatures, ocean\nacidification, salinization, desertification, loss of\nbiodiversity, land and forest degradation, and glacial\nretreat and related impacts. The types of knowledge,\naction, support and approaches to address loss and\ndamage vary considerably and are wide in scope.\nClimate change will affect a wide range of social,\neconomic and environmental systems. Such impacts\nare commonly divided into non-economic losses and\neconomic losses. Economic losses can be understood\nas the loss of resources, goods and services that are\ncommonly traded in markets. As such, economic losses\nshould be recorded by and manifest in the system\nof national accounts (although they may not be in\ncountries with large informal economies). Market prices\ncan be used to value economic losses.\nNon-economic losses can be understood as other\nitems, which are not commonly traded in markets. The\nabsence of a market price is one of the main reasons why\nassessing non-economic losses is challenging. However,\ntheir effect on human welfare is no less important.\nAverting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage\ninvolves a wide range of approaches and actions that\nvary depending upon the circumstances, which include\nthe demography, geography and socioeconomic status\nof the region, country or community experiencing\nthe impacts and the types of impacts experienced.\nIn addition to national trends and circumstances, a\ncountry’s development priorities and risk tolerance can\nalso influence the domestic approaches to addressing\nloss or damage.\nIn the broadest understanding, all efforts being taken\nto curb the global average temperature increase and\nto adapt to the adverse effects of climate change can\ncontribute to preventing or reducing the risks of loss\nand damage associated with climate change borne by\nsocieties and individuals. Similarly, efforts to manage\nrisk comprehensively, take preventive measures\nand carry out pre-emptive efforts (such as planned\nadaptation) will have an effect on the magnitude of\nthe impacts.\nEffective actions to avoid, minimize and address avert,\nminimize and address loss and damage associated\nwith climate change impacts call for enhancing the\nunderstanding of and promoting comprehensive\nrisk management approaches (e.g. assessment,\nreduction, transfer, retention) to build the long-term\nresilience of countries, vulnerable populations and\ncommunities through measures to enhance recovery\nand rehabilitation, social protection instruments and\ntransformational approaches.\nBox 2\nAdditional information related to averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated\nwith climate change impacts\nto select the optimal combination of channels of\ninformation to meet international and national\ninformation needs, while avoiding an undue\nreporting burden and maintaining consistency in their\nadaptation efforts.\nRegarding the possibility of cross-referencing\nprevious documents, Parties will benefit from\nmapping the information they have previously\nsubmitted in other documents, cross-referencing\ninformation that remains valid in such documents,\nand considering what information needs to be\ncollected and submitted anew. In this regard, a Party\ncan limit its reporting of adaptation information to\nan update of information already provided in other\ndocuments.\nIn the last decade, Parties have significantly scaled\nup adaptation efforts, in particular by establishing\nthe process to formulate and implement NAPs,\nsetting up the Adaptation Committee as a key\nconstituted body on adaptation serving both the\nConvention and the Paris Agreement, developing\na robust system for adaptation information under\n\n37\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nthe Paris Agreement and scaling up support for\nNAPs through the Green Climate Fund and other\nmechanisms.\nIn order to apply the adaptation arrangements\nunder the Convention and the Paris Agreement to\nthe highest national benefit, enhance the global\nadaptation effort, reduce duplication of efforts and\nsupport the international arrangements to assess\nprogress on adaptation under the global stocktake,\nParties will need to consider how they combine\nnot just the instruments for communication and\nreporting on adaptation, but also those for planning\nand implementation of adaptation actions. This will\nrequire them to consider how the communication\nand reporting provisions for adaptation can best be\nsynchronized with national- and, as appropriate,\nsubnational-level planning. By including in the\nBTRs detailed information on the implementation of\nnational- and subnational-level actions included and\nsubmitted in relevant planning and programming\ndocuments, Parties can strengthen the coherence and\nrelevance of international reporting and domestic\naction on adaptation.\nAs per Table 4, the ETF also provides an opportunity\nto Parties to provide information related to averting,\nminimizing and addressing loss and damage\nassociated with climate change impacts107 (Box 2).\nThe Paris Agreement recognizes the importance\nof averting, minimizing and addressing loss and\ndamage associated with climate change impacts,\nincluding extreme weather events and slow\nonset events, and provides for Parties to enhance\nunderstanding, action and support, including\nthrough the Warsaw International Mechanism for\nLoss and Damage associated with Climate Change\nImpacts, as appropriate, on a cooperative and\nfacilitative basis with respect to loss and damage\nassociated with the adverse effects of climate\nchange.108\n107 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 115.\n108 Article 8, paragraph 1, of the Paris Agreement.\n109 Decision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 6(b)(ii).\n110 Decision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 36 (e).\n111 Decision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 37 (a).\nConsistent with the requirements on information on\nadaptation, reporting information on climate change\nimpacts, including on averting, minimizing and\naddressing loss and damage associated with climate\nchange impacts, is voluntary. Nevertheless, countries\nthat are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change\ncould benefit from reporting such information.\nAlso, it is important to note that in order to assess\nthe collective progress towards achieving the Paris\nAgreement’s purpose and long-term goals in\nthe thematic areas of mitigation, adaptation and\nmeans of implementation, the global stocktake may\ntake into account, as appropriate, efforts related\nto averting, minimizing and addressing loss and\ndamage associated with the adverse effects of\nclimate change.109\nIn this regard, the global stocktake will consider the\nsources of information, at a collective level and, inter\nalia, on efforts to enhance understanding, action and\nsupport, on a cooperative and facilitative basis, related\nto averting, minimizing and addressing loss and\ndamage associated with the adverse effects of climate\nchange.110 In this regard, reports and communications\nof Parties will be part of the sources of input for the\nglobal stocktake.111\nSince Parties will report for the first time such\ninformation and there have previously not been\nreporting systems or modalities in place under the\nConvention to report on averting, minimizing and\naddressing loss and damage associated with climate\nchange impacts, providing such information could be\nchallenging, in particular for countries with limited\ncapacities and resources.\nThe MPGs provide good basis for reducing the undue\nreporting burden by including averting, minimizing\nand addressing loss and damage associated with\nclimate change impacts as part of the overall reporting\n\n38\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nsetup on climate change impacts and adaptation.\nParties could decide how best to include information\non e.g. institutional arrangements, legal frameworks,\nimpacts, risk and vulnerabilities to avoid duplicating\nrelevant information already included in other parts\nof the chapter. To that end, similar elements of this\nchapter could be worked in together and be addressed\nin a streamlined and integrated manner.\n4. Information on financial,\ntechnology development and\ntransfer and capacity-building\nsupport provided and mobilized\nAs noted in Figure 3 above, developed country Parties\nshall provide information on financial, technology\ndevelopment and transfer and capacity-building\nsupport provided and mobilized pursuant to Article\n13, paragraph 9, and in accordance with chapter V\nof the MPGs. In addition, other Parties that provide\nsuch support should provide this information and, in\ndoing so, are encouraged to use the MPGs contained\nin chapter V. For the purpose of this document,\ninformation provided in this chapter focuses mainly\non the reporting required of these “other Parties” that\nprovide support to developing country Parties.\nChapter V of the MPGs includes provisions on the\nfollowing:\nA.\nNational circumstances and institutional\narrangements\nB.\nUnderlying assumptions, definitions and\nmethodologies\nC.\nInformation on financial support provided and\nmobilized under Article 9\nD.\nInformation on support for technology\ndevelopment and transfer provided under Article 10\n112 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 119.\n113 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 120.\nE.\nInformation on capacity-building support\nprovided under Article 11.\nIt should be noted that the common tabular formats\nfor the electronic reporting of the information\nreferred to in this chapter are still being developed by\nthe SBSTA to be completed by COP26.\n4.1 National circumstances and\ninstitutional arrangements\nIn reporting information on financial support provided\nand mobilized, developed country Parties shall and other\nParties that provide support are encouraged to use the\nMPGs when providing information that explains the\nnational context and efforts undertaken.

Many times, different Parties\nhave different understandings of a reporting category\n(e.g. how the support is considered as being climatespecific and/or allocated to mitigation or adaptation\nactions). While it currently may not be feasible for\nParties to use the same underlying assumptions,\ndefinitions and methodologies, they shall or should still\n114 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraphs 121 and 122.\nexplain the underlying assumptions, definitions and\nmethodologies they used in a transparent way. This will\nenhance understanding of the information reported\nand improve comparability. Another key consideration\nin reporting information on support provided is double\ncounting. In this regard, the MPGs contain a set of\nprovisions on reporting information on the efforts taken\nto avoid double counting (see Table 5).\nTable 5\nInformation to be reported on avoidance of double counting of support provided115\nPARTIES THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT SHOULD REPORT INFORMATION ON THEIR EFFORTS TAKEN\nTO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING, INCLUDING ON:\nHow double counting among multiple Parties involved in the provision of support was avoided\nHow double counting among multiple Parties involved in the mobilization of private finance through public interventions\nwas avoided, including the methodologies and assumptions used to attribute the mobilized resources through public\ninterventions reported to the Party that reports them, if possible relative to the type of instrument used for the mobilization\nHow double counting was avoided between the resources reported as provided or mobilized, and the resources used under\nArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement by the acquiring Party for use towards the achievement of its NDC\nHow support is attributed between multiple recipient countries, in cases where a project involves multiple recipient\ncountries and where this information is reported on a country-by-country basis\n115 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 121 (m).\n\n40\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\n4.3 Information on financial support provided\nand mobilized under Article 9\nAs illustrated in Figure 8, the MPGs are most extensive\nfor the reporting requirements on information on\nfinancial support provided and mobilized116, as Parties\nare required to report on information pertaining to\nbilateral, regional and other channels (in a tabular\nformat); multilateral channels (in a tabular format);\nand information on finance mobilized through public\ninterventions.\nInformation on financial support provided through\n116 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraphs 123-125.\nbilateral and multilateral channels is probably\nthe reporting category where Parties (essentially\ndeveloped country Parties) have the most experience\nand established methodologies.

This section discusses\nsome of the key explicit interlinkages of the ETF with:\n• Communication and accounting of NDCs;\n• The global stocktake;\n• The process for adaptation communications and\nother arrangements for adaptation information;\n• The committee to facilitate implementation and\npromote compliance.\n1. Communication and accounting\nof nationally determined\ncontributions under Article 4\nAs explained in chapter III.3, the information necessary\nto facilitate clarity, transparency and understanding of an\nNDC under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement overlaps in\na number of ways with the description of the NDC that\nmust be included in the ETF as part of the information\nnecessary to track the progress of implementation\nand achievement of the NDC under Article 4. Further,\naccording to the accounting guidance applied to the\nsecond and subsequent NDCs, the accounting of NDCs\nwill be undertaken and reported in the BTR, including\nthrough a structured summary.\n2.

The state of GHG emissions by sources and\nremovals by sinks and mitigation efforts\nundertaken by Parties, including the information\nprovided in the national inventory report;4\n2. The overall effect of Parties’ NDCs and the\noverall progress made by Parties towards the\nimplementation of their NDCs, including the\ninformation necessary to track progress in\nimplementing and achieving them;5\n3. The state of adaptation efforts, support,\nexperience and priorities, including\nthe information provided in adaptation\ncommunications6 and in the BTR;7\n4. The finance flows and means of implementation,\nincluding information referring to support\nprovided, needed and received.8\n3. Linkages between reporting\nadaptation in the biennial\ntransparency report and other\narrangements for providing\nadaptation information\nThe MPGs for adaptation information in BTRs also specify\nor imply a set of linkages with other arrangements for\n1\nDecision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraphs 1 and 2.\n2\nDecision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 37 (a).\n3\nDecision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 36 (a)–(d).\n4\nArticle 13, paragraph 7 (a) of the Paris Agreement.\n5\nArticle 13, paragraph 7 (b) of the Paris Agreement.\n6\nArticle 7, paragraphs 10 and 11, of the Paris Agreement.\n7\nArticle 13, paragraph 8 of the Paris Agreement.\n8\nArticle 13, paragraphs 9 and 10, of the Paris Agreement\n9\nDecision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 14.\n10\nDecision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 13.\nadaptation information. These linkages relate to the\nprocess of communication/reporting or to the types of\ninformation to be included in various documents.\nGenerally, the MPGs for the transparency framework\nfor action and support specify that, when including\nadaptation information, Parties may cross-reference\nadaptation information in other documents, and focus\non updating information previously supplied.9 This\nmeans that Parties that may have recently submitted a\nnational communication, an adaptation communication\nor documents relating to their NAPs can reference the\ninformation provided in those documents and do not\nneed to resubmit or recompile similar information.\nMore specifically, the adaptation sections of a BTR are\nlinked with the process of adaptation communications.\nIn its paragraph 4, decision 9/CMA.1 provides that\nParties may submit and update their adaptation\ncommunication “as a component of or in conjunction\nwith the reports on impacts and adaptation as stipulated\nin Article 13, paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement.\nIn addition, the MPGs emphasizes that, when doing\nso, Parties should clearly identify which parts of the\nadaptation sections of the BTR constitute the adaptation\ncommunication, so that it may be easily identified.10\nAn additional aspect linking the adaptation sections of\nthe BTRs with other processes is the types of information\nto be provided. There are significant overlaps between\nthe types of adaptation information to be reported\ndefined the MPGs for the BTRs, and the guidance other\nprocesses such national communications, adaptation\ncommunications or documents related to national\nadaptation plans.

Parties may submit their national\ncommunication and BTR as a single report, in\naccordance with the ETF MPGs for information\nalso covered by the national communication\nreporting guidelines contained in, as applicable,\ndecisions 4/CP.5 and 17/CP.8;\n2. In addition, Parties shall include in the report:\na) Supplemental chapters on research and\nsystematic observation and on education,\ntraining and public awareness, in\n5\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 41.\n6\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 42.\n7\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 43.\n8\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 44.\n9\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 45.\naccordance with the guidelines contained in,\nas applicable, decisions 4/CP.5 and 17/CP.8;\nb) For those Parties that have not reported\nunder chapter IV of the annex to decision\n18/CMA.1, an additional chapter on\nadaptation, in accordance with the relevant\nguidelines contained in, as applicable,\ndecisions 4/CP.5 and 17/CP.8;\n3.

However, these\nParties can choose to use the MPGs contained in\ndecision 18/CMA.1 and its annex to meet their\nreporting commitments under Articles 4 and 12 of\nthe Convention, in lieu of the guidance adopted\nunder the Convention. For the purpose of national\ncommunications, the arrangements described in\nparagraph above are applicable here as well if the\nParty so chooses.8\n• REDD-plus technical annex: COP 24 decided\nthat the REDD-plus technical annex shall\nbe submitted as an annex to the BTR9 and\nthat its technical analysis shall be carried out\n\n69\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nconcurrently with the TER.10 The MRV modalities\nfor REDD-plus11 have not been modified as\npart of the MPGs. Hence, there will not be any\nmajor changes in the way developing country\nParties submit the results of REDD-plus activities\nin the context of “results-based payments” as\na technical annex to the BTR. In other words,\nfor REDD-plus, the only difference between\nthe current MRV arrangements and the ETF\nprocedure will be the “vehicle” to which the\nREDD-plus technical annex will be attached. The\ncontent of the technical annex will continue to be\nelaborated according to the Warsaw Framework\nfor REDD-plus, in particular decision 14/CP.19.\nFigure 23 provides an indicative timeline of the\nevolution of the transparency arrangements under the\nConvention and the Paris Agreement.\nSince the MPGs for the ETF were guided by\nthe principle of building on and enhancing the\ntransparency arrangements under the Convention12\nit is no surprise that several reporting and review\nrequirements under the ETF are similar and/\nor consistent with those of the current MRV\narrangements under the Convention. Therefore,\nParties should face only a few critical challenges to\nimplementing the ETF.\nRegardless of the specific challenges, each Party will be\nat a different “starting point” in the transition from the\ncurrent MRV arrangements under the Convention to\nthe ETF. By assessing their data availability/ capacity/\ngaps constraints vis-a-vis the ETF provisions as soon\n10\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 46.\n11\nDecision 14/CP.19.\n12\nDecision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 3 (a).\nas possible, Parties will not only facilitate better\nplanning, but also help identify from an early stage\narea where support is needed. By further continuing\nto enhance their efforts to prepare and submit\nnational communications and BURs, and participate\nin the international consultation and analysis process\nin the immediate future (from now through the next\ntwo or three years), developing country Parties will\ndevelop their national capacity to prepare BTRs and\nstand prepared to participate effectively in the TER\nprocess and the facilitative, multilateral consideration\nof progress.\nDeveloping country Parties could begin to assess\ntheir data availability/capacity/gaps constraints\nto deliver the first BTR and steps that need to be\ntaken in the transition to the ETF by mapping\nthe information that has already been reported\nunder the current MRV arrangements under\nthe Convention and its correlation and eventual\nchanges in scope and depth in relation to the\nprovisions contained in the MPGs for the ETF. The\ntable contained in an addendum to this handbook,\nprovides an example of how such an assessment\ncould be undertaken. Using this table as a tool, a\ndeveloping country Party could identify the specific\ninformation that already exists and the gaps in\nrelation to the provisions contained in the MPGs.\nIt is important to highlight that if such an exercise\nis undertaken, it needs to be carried out by the\nParty on an individual basis, since the availability\nof information, capacities and existing gaps will be\ncountry-specific and will need to be evaluated with\nan appropriate level of detail.\n\n70\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nFigure 23\nIndicative timeline of moving towards the enhanced transparency framework\n Ongoing work\nunder SBSTA\nto develop,\nCRTs, CTFs,\nand outlines\nof BTR, NID\nand TER**\nreport (to be\ncompleted by\nCOP 26)\nTechnical analysis of REDD-plus activities for\nresult-based incentives\nDeveloped country Parties\n» Annual GHG inventories\n» National communications*\nDeveloping country Parties\n» National communications*\nDeveloping country Parties\n» Final BURs by no later than 31 December 2024\nAll Parties\n» First BTRs by, at the latest, 31 December 2024 (SIDS and LDCs\nhave discretion)\n» TER (to be initiated immediately following the submission)\n» Facilitative, multilateral consideration of progress (as soon as\npossible following the publication of the TER report)\nDeveloped country Parties\n» Final biennial reports by no\nlater than 31 December 2022\nMoving towards the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\n» Flexibility to those developing country Parties that need it in the light of\ntheir capacities\n» Facilitating improved reporting and transparency over time\nExisting MRV arrangements\n* Parties may submit their national communication and biennial transparency report as a single report\n**CRT common reporting tables; CTF common tabular formats; NID national inventory document\nEnhanced transparency framework\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2030\n2031\n2029\n2019\n\n71\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nChapter VII\nOther technical reference documents\nThere are number of technical reference documents\nsimilar to this one that have been issued by other\norganizations.
