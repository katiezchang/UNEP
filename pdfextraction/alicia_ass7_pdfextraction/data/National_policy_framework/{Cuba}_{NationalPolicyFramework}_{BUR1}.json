Many times, different Parties\nhave different understandings of a reporting category\n(e.g. how the support is considered as being climatespecific and/or allocated to mitigation or adaptation\nactions). While it currently may not be feasible for\nParties to use the same underlying assumptions,\ndefinitions and methodologies, they shall or should still\n114 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraphs 121 and 122.\nexplain the underlying assumptions, definitions and\nmethodologies they used in a transparent way. This will\nenhance understanding of the information reported\nand improve comparability. Another key consideration\nin reporting information on support provided is double\ncounting. In this regard, the MPGs contain a set of\nprovisions on reporting information on the efforts taken\nto avoid double counting (see Table 5).\nTable 5\nInformation to be reported on avoidance of double counting of support provided115\nPARTIES THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT SHOULD REPORT INFORMATION ON THEIR EFFORTS TAKEN\nTO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING, INCLUDING ON:\nHow double counting among multiple Parties involved in the provision of support was avoided\nHow double counting among multiple Parties involved in the mobilization of private finance through public interventions\nwas avoided, including the methodologies and assumptions used to attribute the mobilized resources through public\ninterventions reported to the Party that reports them, if possible relative to the type of instrument used for the mobilization\nHow double counting was avoided between the resources reported as provided or mobilized, and the resources used under\nArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement by the acquiring Party for use towards the achievement of its NDC\nHow support is attributed between multiple recipient countries, in cases where a project involves multiple recipient\ncountries and where this information is reported on a country-by-country basis\n115 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 121 (m).\n\n40\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\n4.3 Information on financial support provided\nand mobilized under Article 9\nAs illustrated in Figure 8, the MPGs are most extensive\nfor the reporting requirements on information on\nfinancial support provided and mobilized116, as Parties\nare required to report on information pertaining to\nbilateral, regional and other channels (in a tabular\nformat); multilateral channels (in a tabular format);\nand information on finance mobilized through public\ninterventions.\nInformation on financial support provided through\n116 Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraphs 123-125.\nbilateral and multilateral channels is probably\nthe reporting category where Parties (essentially\ndeveloped country Parties) have the most experience\nand established methodologies.

of the nature of technology development and\ntransfer and capacity-building actions, the reporting of\nthese kinds of support is generally qualitative, in contrast\nwith the reporting of financial support provided, which\ncan often be quantified. Therefore, the information\non financial support provided and mobilized will be\nmore granular and specific than the information on\ntechnology development and transfer and capacitybuilding, which will be reported in a textual format.\n\n42\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nFigure 9\nInformation to be reported on technology development and transfer support provided\nIn a textual format\na) Strategies employed to support technology development\nand transfer, including case studies;\nb) Support provided at diﬀerent stages of the technology cycle;\nc) Support for the development and enhancement of\nendogenous capacities and technologies of developing\ncountry Parties;\nd) Eﬀorts to encourage private sector activities related to\ntechnology development and transfer and how such eﬀorts\nsupport developing country Parties;\ne) Eﬀorts to accelerate, encourage and enable innovation,\nincluding research, development and deployment eﬀorts,\nand collaborative approaches to research and development;\nf) Knowledge generated.\nIn a common tabular format\n(quantitative and/or qualitative information)\na) Title;\nb) Recipient entity;\nc) Description and objectives;\nd) Type of support (mitigation, adaptation or cross-cutting);\ne) Sector;\nf) Type of technology;\ng) Status of measure or activity;\nh) Whether the activity was undertaken by the public and/or\nprivate sector.\nFigure 10\nInformation to be reported on capacity-building support provided\nIn a textual format\na) Strategies employed to provide capacity-building support, including case studies;\nb) How capacity-building support that was provided responds to the existing and\nemerging capacity-building needs, priorities and gaps identiﬁed by developing\ncountry Parties in the areas of mitigation, adaptation, and technology development and transfer;\nc) Policies that promote capacity-building support;\nd) Involvement of stakeholders;\ne) How support for capacity-building actions in developing country Parties that was\nprovided promotes the sharing of lessons learned and best practices.\nIn a common tabular format\n(quantitative and/or\nqualitative information)\na) Title;\nb) Recipient entity;\nc) Description and objectives;\nd) Type of support (mitigation, adaptation\nor cross-cutting);\ne) Status of measure or activity.\n\n43\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\n5.

The state of GHG emissions by sources and\nremovals by sinks and mitigation efforts\nundertaken by Parties, including the information\nprovided in the national inventory report;4\n2. The overall effect of Parties’ NDCs and the\noverall progress made by Parties towards the\nimplementation of their NDCs, including the\ninformation necessary to track progress in\nimplementing and achieving them;5\n3.

The finance flows and means of implementation,\nincluding information referring to support\nprovided, needed and received.8\n3. Linkages between reporting\nadaptation in the biennial\ntransparency report and other\narrangements for providing\nadaptation information\nThe MPGs for adaptation information in BTRs also specify\nor imply a set of linkages with other arrangements for\n1\nDecision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraphs 1 and 2.\n2\nDecision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 37 (a).\n3\nDecision 19/CMA.1, paragraph 36 (a)–(d).\n4\nArticle 13, paragraph 7 (a) of the Paris Agreement.\n5\nArticle 13, paragraph 7 (b) of the Paris Agreement.\n6\nArticle 7, paragraphs 10 and 11, of the Paris Agreement.\n7\nArticle 13, paragraph 8 of the Paris Agreement.\n8\nArticle 13, paragraphs 9 and 10, of the Paris Agreement\n9\nDecision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 14.\n10\nDecision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 13.\nadaptation information. These linkages relate to the\nprocess of communication/reporting or to the types of\ninformation to be included in various documents.\nGenerally, the MPGs for the transparency framework\nfor action and support specify that, when including\nadaptation information, Parties may cross-reference\nadaptation information in other documents, and focus\non updating information previously supplied.9 This\nmeans that Parties that may have recently submitted a\nnational communication, an adaptation communication\nor documents relating to their NAPs can reference the\ninformation provided in those documents and do not\nneed to resubmit or recompile similar information.\nMore specifically, the adaptation sections of a BTR are\nlinked with the process of adaptation communications.\nIn its paragraph 4, decision 9/CMA.1 provides that\nParties may submit and update their adaptation\ncommunication “as a component of or in conjunction\nwith the reports on impacts and adaptation as stipulated\nin Article 13, paragraph 8, of the Paris Agreement.\nIn addition, the MPGs emphasizes that, when doing\nso, Parties should clearly identify which parts of the\nadaptation sections of the BTR constitute the adaptation\ncommunication, so that it may be easily identified.10\nAn additional aspect linking the adaptation sections of\nthe BTRs with other processes is the types of information\nto be provided. There are significant overlaps between\nthe types of adaptation information to be reported\ndefined the MPGs for the BTRs, and the guidance other\nprocesses such national communications, adaptation\ncommunications or documents related to national\nadaptation plans.

Committee to facilitate\nimplementation and promote\ncompliance\nThe mechanism to facilitate implementation of\nand promote compliance with the provisions of\n12\nDecision 20/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 1.\n13\nDecision 20/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 20.\nthe Paris Agreement, referred to in Article 15 of the\nAgreement, consists of a committee.12 The committee\nconsiders issues related to, as appropriate, a Party’s\nimplementation of or compliance with the provisions\nof the Paris Agreement.13 In addition, in certain\ncircumstances, the committee will itself initiate\n\n66\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nconsideration of a matter. The ETF-related conditions\nthat will prompt the committee to initiate consideration\nof issues include the following:\n• If a Party fails to submit a mandatory report or\ncommunication of information under Article 13,\nparagraphs 7 and 9, or Article 9, paragraph 7, of the\nParis Agreement;14\n• If Party does not participate in the facilitative,\nmultilateral consideration of progress, based on\ninformation provided by the secretariat.15\nFurthermore, pursuant to Article 13, paragraphs 7 and\n9, of the Paris Agreement and the MPGs, the committee\n14\nDecision 20/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 22 (a)(ii).\n15\nDecision 20/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 22 (a)(iii).\nmay, with the consent of the Party concerned, engage in\na facilitative consideration of issues in cases of significant\nand persistent inconsistencies in the information\nsubmitted by a Party. This consideration will be based\non the recommendations made in the final TER reports,\ntogether with any written comments provided by the\nParty during the review. In its consideration of such\nmatters, the Committee shall take into account Article\n13, paragraph 14 and 15, which provide that support\nshall be provided to developing country Parties for\nthe implementation of the ETF and for the building\nof transparency-related capacity, as well as flexibilities\nprovided in the provisions of the MPGS for those\ndeveloping countries that need it in the light of their\ncapacities.\n© unsplash.com\n\n67\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nChapter VI\nTransitioning to the\nenhanced transparency\nframework\nCOP 21 decided that the MPGs will supersede the\nMRV arrangements established by decision 1/CP.16,\nparagraphs 40–47 and 60–64, and decision 2/CP.17,\nparagraphs 12–62, following the submission of the\nfinal biennial reports and BURs. This is applicable to\nthose Parties to the Convention that are also Parties to\nthe Paris Agreement.1\nDecisions adopted in Katowice by COP 24 and CMA\n1 addressed a number of practical aspects that\noperationalize the decision by COP 21 referred to\nabove. These include the following:\n• Submission of final biennial reports and BURs:\nCOP 24 decided that the dates for submission\nof the final biennial reports shall be those that\nare submitted to the secretariat no later than 31\nDecember 2022, and the final BURs shall be those\nthat are submitted to the secretariat no later than\n31 December 2024.2\n• Submission of the first BTR: CMA 1 decided that\nParties shall submit their first BTR at the latest by\n31 December 2024.3 However, LDCs and SIDS may\nsubmit the first BTR at their discretion.4\n• Superseding the existing MRV arrangements: COP\n24 decided that, for those Parties to the Convention\nthat are also Parties to the Paris Agreement,\nthe BTRs, TER and the facilitative, multilateral\n1\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 39.\n2\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 38.\n3\nDecision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 3.\n4\nDecision 18/CMA.1, paragraph 4.\n© unsplash.com\n\n68\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nconsideration of progress prepared and conducted\nin accordance with the MPGs above shall\nreplace the biennial reports, BURs, international\nassessment and review, and international\nconsultation and analysis.5\n• Annual GHG inventories: COP 24 decided that,\nin order to fulfil national inventory reporting\nobligations under the Convention, Parties to the\nParis Agreement submitting annual national\ninventory reports under the Convention shall\nuse the MPGs for national inventory reports by\nthe date that the reports are first due under the\nParis Agreement, with the TER to be conducted\nin accordance with the corresponding MPGs\ncontained in chapter VII of the annex to decision\n18/CMA.1, in place of the greenhouse gas\ninventory reporting guidelines contained in\nthe annex to decision 24/CP.19 and the review\nguidelines in the annex to decision 13/CP.20,\nrespectively, including in years in which a BTR is\nnot due under the Paris Agreement.6\n• National communications under the Convention:\nCOP 24 decided that, with respect to the reporting\nand review of national communications under the\nConvention every four years, starting from the date\nthat reports are first due under the Paris Agreement:7\n1. Parties may submit their national\ncommunication and BTR as a single report, in\naccordance with the ETF MPGs for information\nalso covered by the national communication\nreporting guidelines contained in, as applicable,\ndecisions 4/CP.5 and 17/CP.8;\n2. In addition, Parties shall include in the report:\na) Supplemental chapters on research and\nsystematic observation and on education,\ntraining and public awareness, in\n5\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 41.\n6\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 42.\n7\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 43.\n8\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 44.\n9\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 45.\naccordance with the guidelines contained in,\nas applicable, decisions 4/CP.5 and 17/CP.8;\nb) For those Parties that have not reported\nunder chapter IV of the annex to decision\n18/CMA.1, an additional chapter on\nadaptation, in accordance with the relevant\nguidelines contained in, as applicable,\ndecisions 4/CP.5 and 17/CP.8;\n3. For those Parties whose national\ncommunications are subject to review\nunder decision 13/CP.20, the review shall be\nconducted in accordance with the relevant\nguidelines contained in chapter VII of the\nannex to decision 18/CMA.1, and shall also\ninclude a review of the information submitted\nunder paragraph 43(b) of decision 1/CP.24,\nin accordance with the relevant guidance in\ndecision 13/CP.20, as applicable.\n• Reporting obligations of Parties to the Convention\nthat are not Parties to the Paris Agreement: The\nreporting obligations under Articles 4 and 12 of\nthe Convention and existing MRV arrangements\nunder the Convention shall continue to apply\nto those Parties to the Convention that are not\nParties to the Paris Agreement. However, these\nParties can choose to use the MPGs contained in\ndecision 18/CMA.1 and its annex to meet their\nreporting commitments under Articles 4 and 12 of\nthe Convention, in lieu of the guidance adopted\nunder the Convention. For the purpose of national\ncommunications, the arrangements described in\nparagraph above are applicable here as well if the\nParty so chooses.8\n• REDD-plus technical annex: COP 24 decided\nthat the REDD-plus technical annex shall\nbe submitted as an annex to the BTR9 and\nthat its technical analysis shall be carried out\n\n69\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nconcurrently with the TER.10 The MRV modalities\nfor REDD-plus11 have not been modified as\npart of the MPGs. Hence, there will not be any\nmajor changes in the way developing country\nParties submit the results of REDD-plus activities\nin the context of “results-based payments” as\na technical annex to the BTR. In other words,\nfor REDD-plus, the only difference between\nthe current MRV arrangements and the ETF\nprocedure will be the “vehicle” to which the\nREDD-plus technical annex will be attached. The\ncontent of the technical annex will continue to be\nelaborated according to the Warsaw Framework\nfor REDD-plus, in particular decision 14/CP.19.\nFigure 23 provides an indicative timeline of the\nevolution of the transparency arrangements under the\nConvention and the Paris Agreement.\nSince the MPGs for the ETF were guided by\nthe principle of building on and enhancing the\ntransparency arrangements under the Convention12\nit is no surprise that several reporting and review\nrequirements under the ETF are similar and/\nor consistent with those of the current MRV\narrangements under the Convention. Therefore,\nParties should face only a few critical challenges to\nimplementing the ETF.\nRegardless of the specific challenges, each Party will be\nat a different “starting point” in the transition from the\ncurrent MRV arrangements under the Convention to\nthe ETF. By assessing their data availability/ capacity/\ngaps constraints vis-a-vis the ETF provisions as soon\n10\nDecision 1/CP.24, paragraph 46.\n11\nDecision 14/CP.19.\n12\nDecision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 3 (a).\nas possible, Parties will not only facilitate better\nplanning, but also help identify from an early stage\narea where support is needed. By further continuing\nto enhance their efforts to prepare and submit\nnational communications and BURs, and participate\nin the international consultation and analysis process\nin the immediate future (from now through the next\ntwo or three years), developing country Parties will\ndevelop their national capacity to prepare BTRs and\nstand prepared to participate effectively in the TER\nprocess and the facilitative, multilateral consideration\nof progress.\nDeveloping country Parties could begin to assess\ntheir data availability/capacity/gaps constraints\nto deliver the first BTR and steps that need to be\ntaken in the transition to the ETF by mapping\nthe information that has already been reported\nunder the current MRV arrangements under\nthe Convention and its correlation and eventual\nchanges in scope and depth in relation to the\nprovisions contained in the MPGs for the ETF. The\ntable contained in an addendum to this handbook,\nprovides an example of how such an assessment\ncould be undertaken. Using this table as a tool, a\ndeveloping country Party could identify the specific\ninformation that already exists and the gaps in\nrelation to the provisions contained in the MPGs.\nIt is important to highlight that if such an exercise\nis undertaken, it needs to be carried out by the\nParty on an individual basis, since the availability\nof information, capacities and existing gaps will be\ncountry-specific and will need to be evaluated with\nan appropriate level of detail.\n\n70\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nFigure 23\nIndicative timeline of moving towards the enhanced transparency framework\n Ongoing work\nunder SBSTA\nto develop,\nCRTs, CTFs,\nand outlines\nof BTR, NID\nand TER**\nreport (to be\ncompleted by\nCOP 26)\nTechnical analysis of REDD-plus activities for\nresult-based incentives\nDeveloped country Parties\n» Annual GHG inventories\n» National communications*\nDeveloping country Parties\n» National communications*\nDeveloping country Parties\n» Final BURs by no later than 31 December 2024\nAll Parties\n» First BTRs by, at the latest, 31 December 2024 (SIDS and LDCs\nhave discretion)\n» TER (to be initiated immediately following the submission)\n» Facilitative, multilateral consideration of progress (as soon as\npossible following the publication of the TER report)\nDeveloped country Parties\n» Final biennial reports by no\nlater than 31 December 2022\nMoving towards the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\n» Flexibility to those developing country Parties that need it in the light of\ntheir capacities\n» Facilitating improved reporting and transparency over time\nExisting MRV arrangements\n* Parties may submit their national communication and biennial transparency report as a single report\n**CRT common reporting tables; CTF common tabular formats; NID national inventory document\nEnhanced transparency framework\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2030\n2031\n2029\n2019\n\n71\nUnited Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\nTechnical handbook for developing country Parties on\npreparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement\nChapter VII\nOther technical reference documents\nThere are number of technical reference documents\nsimilar to this one that have been issued by other\norganizations.
