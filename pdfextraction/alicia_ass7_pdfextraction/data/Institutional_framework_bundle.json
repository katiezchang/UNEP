For example, evidence now shows\nthat climate change increased the intensity of rainfall in the\nshort rainy season in the Horn of Africa in 2023, leading to\nsevere flash flooding in eastern which caused more than\n300 deaths and displaced over a million people.\n\n▶\nThe three most significant climatic hazards in Kenya are\nanalysed in latest draft AdCom (2024) for the country and\nsummarised below, these include increasing temperatures,\nchanging rainfall patterns, and sea level rise along the coast.\n\n▶\nCurrent data shows that Kenya is ranked 145th out of 187\ncountries in the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative\n(ND-GAIN) index, which ranks countries on their level of\nvulnerability to climate change and readiness to implement\nadaptation solutions.\n\n▶\nKenya’s rapidly increasing population and subsequent\nmigration to urban areas has also been identified as a\nfactor that increases vulnerability to climate change; this\nis significantly attributable to low coping adaptive capacity\nas over 51 percent of the urban population in Kenya in\n2020 was considered poor and living in unplanned informal\nsettlements without basic infrastructure and services.\n\n▶\nOverall, across the country, evidence suggests that frequent\ncycles of floods and droughts have significant socio-economic\nimpacts; these often cause high economic costs as scarce\ngovernment resources are re-allocated to respond to climate\nemergencies.\n\n▶\nIn monetary terms, the socio-economic losses associated\nwith climate change in Kenya over the past decade were\nestimated to amount to between 3 percent and 5 percent\nof the country’s GDP per year.\nD. Implementation Progress\nThe government has made progress in implementing adaptation\nactions towards the target of a climate-resilient society by 2030.\nSome areas of progress have been highlighted below.\n\n▶\nThe government effectively coordinated more than Ksh. 70\nbillion drought response interventions during the 2021 –\n2023 drought. The government contributed KSh. 22 billion,\nwhile non-state actors contributed KSh. 48 billion.\n\n▶\nOver 3,000 water tanks, dams, boreholes, pans, or earth\ndams were constructed or installed for water harvesting\nand storage across ASAL counties with high drought risk.\n\n▶\nThe Asset Creation Programme constructed rainwater\nharvesting structures in 1,000 sites across 14 ASAL counties.\nThe government operationalized the National Drought\nEmergency Fund (NDEF) and gazetted and sensitized\nthe members of the County Drought and Food Security\nCommittees (CDFSC) for county-level coordination in the\n23 ASAL counties. So far, the Fund has received a total of\nKsh. 345 million in funding from the National Treasury for\ndifferent components.\n\n▶\nAs part of the plan to increase flood resilience, the government,\nthrough the Kenya Meteorology Department (KMD), has\nincreased the amount and timeliness of flood early warnings\nand weather forecasts during rain seasons.\n\n▶\nThe National Drought Management Authority (NDMA)\ndisbursed over KES 3.3 billion under the HSNP through more\nthan 100,000 households, out of which 60% of recipients\nwere women in arid counties.\n\n▶\nAround 200,000 actors in the agriculture sector are now\nharvesting and storing water for irrigation.\n\n▶\nThe area under irrigation in Kenya has increased by over\n5,000 Hectares.\n\n▶\nClose to 400,000 farmers have access to climate-oriented\ncrop insurance\n\n▶\nThe number of farmers accessing climate-oriented livestock\ninsurance increased marginally as new farmer households\ninsured over 90,000 cattle by the end of 2022.\n\n▶\nOver 55 hydrogeological surveys were undertaken across\nseveral counties in Kenya as efforts towards sustainable\ngroundwater abstraction.\n\n▶\nDe-siltation of existing dams, extending water pipelines,\nand protecting water catchment areas and sources such as\nsprings enhanced the availability of safe water and reduced\ndistances travelled to access water.\n\n▶\nThe annual ASALs water harvesting and storage capacity\nimproved by 1,130,000 M3 from the 38 water pans, 6\nsubsurface dams constructed, and 73 boreholes and shallow\nwells in 11 ASAL counties\n\n▶\nThe annual ASALs water harvesting and storage capacity\nimproved by 1,130,000 M3 from the 38 water pans, 6\nsubsurface dams constructed and 73 bore holes and\nshallow wells in 11 ASAL counties\n\n▶\nThe government has also supported close to 300,000 new\nhouseholds in Kenya to adopt diversified adaptive enterprises\nfor sustained livelihoods and nutrition security. Examples\nof such enterprises include indigenous poultry, dairy goats,\ndairy intensification, tissue culture in banana production,\nand pasture seeds, among others.\n| x Biennial Transparency Report\n\n▶\nThe Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Project\n(KIWASH, 2015-2020) enabled nearly 900,000 Kenyans across\nnine counties to gain access to improved water security,\nsanitation, and hygiene services and assisted households\nin gaining access to irrigation and nutrition services.\n\n▶\nTo increase water harvesting and water storage infrastructure,\nover 600 boreholes have been constructed to tap into\ngroundwater resources in response to increased water\nscarcity resulting mainly from drought in the most vulnerable\ncounties.\n\n▶\nIn the coast of Kenya, over 600 Ha of mangrove forests were\neither planted or rehabilitated to protect the coastline and\nsustain ecosystem services for the coastal communities;\nthis is key for their livelihood resilience and adaptation.\n\n▶\nThe World Agroforestry Centre established the Kenya\nRangelands Ecosystem Services Productivity Programme to\nimprove the livelihoods of communities and their landscapes\nby enhancing the productivity of ecosystem services provided\nby rangelands for food, feed, and human and wildlife security\nin Laikipia, Samburu, Isiolo, and Baringo.\n\n▶\nKenya Breweries developed a low-cost beer made from\nsorghum. This has created new market opportunities for\nthe brewer as well supported over 47,000 farmers from\nmarginal areas to transition from subsistence to sustainable\ncommercial farming.\nE. Support Needed and Received\n\n▶\nKenya requires USD 62 billion until 2030 to support the\nimplementation of NDC targets.\n\n▶\nKenya has received a total of about USD 508 Million in\nthis BTR period. This constitutes both on-budget and offbudget support.\n\n▶\nThe on-budget support accounts for 89% of the total sum\nwhich is USD 457 Million.\n\n▶\nOff-budget support amounted to USD 51 Million.\n\n▶\nUSD 53 Million was delivered as grants, USD 365 million\nwas in loans.\nBiennial Transparency Report xi |\n\nChapter One\n01\nNational Inventory Report of Anthropogenic\nEmissions by Sources and Removals by Sinks\nof Greenhouse Gases\n1.1.\tOverview\nKenya has developed a stand-alone inventory report that includes\na national inventory document and common reporting tables.\nThe inventory document has been annexed to the Biennial\nTransparency Report (BTR), while the common reporting tables\nhave been submitted electronically using the UNFCCC CRT tools.\nThe inventory report has been prepared in line with the modalities,\nprocedures, and guidelines for the enhanced transparency\nframework provided in the annex to decision 18/CMA.1.\nAccording to the estimations, Kenya’s total greenhouse gas\nemissions were equivalent to 113,366 GgCO2eq, including the\nLULUCF Sector in 2022. Total CO2 emissions for the year 2022\nare estimated to be 66,519.7 GgCO2eq without contribution\nfrom LULUCF. For details, please refer to the national inventory\ndocument.\n1.2. Description of GHG emissions and removals\n1.2.1. Overview of greenhouse gas inventory\nBackground information on Kenya’s greenhouse gas inventory\nKenya has developed a stand-alone GHG inventory document that\ncontains information on emissions and removals of GHGs. The\ninventory document has been developed in line with the provisions\nof the modalities, procedures and guidelines for the enhanced\ntransparency framework provided in the annex to decision 18/\nCMA.1. Therefore, this chapter provides only a summary of the\ninformation in the report.\nKenya’s emissions for the GHG inventory have been estimated in\nline with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for the National Greenhouse Gas\nInventories (2006 IPCC Guidelines), which were developed by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Kenya used\nthe IPCC software to estimate the emissions for all the sectors.\n1.2.2. Description of emission and removal trends for aggregated GHG\nemissions and removals\nKenya’s total greenhouse gas emissions were equivalent to\n113,366 GgCO2eq including the LULUCF Sector in 2022. The\ntotal greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 343 percent\nsince 1990 (Table 1.1). Total CO2 emissions for the year 2022 are\nestimated to be 66,519.7 GgCO2eq without contribution from\nLULUCF. Trends in total emissions for the time series 1990 to\n2022 are shown in figures 1.1 and 1.2. In general emission have\nbeen increasing since 1990 rising to 69,399.5 GgCO2eq in 2021\nwithout LULUCF and then dropping slightly in 2022.\nBiennial Transparency Report 1 |\n\nTable 1.1: Total National Emissions without and with LULUCF\nTotal National\nemissions (GgCO2eq)\nYear\nAnnual\ngrowth\nrate\n~% Change\n1990 - 2022\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2020\n2022\nWithout LULUCF\n25,593.70\n25,045.00\n40,886.20\n67,873.60\n66,519.70\n5%\n160%\nWith LULUCF\n25,593.70\n25,045.00\n55,861.10\n108,330.40\n113,366.00\n10%\n343%\n\nFigure 1.1: Kenya total greenhouse gas emissions trends 1990 – 2022 with the LULUCF sector\n\nFigure 1.2: Kenya total greenhouse gas emissions trends 1990–2022 without LULUCF\nEmission growth is primarily driven by Energy and AFOLU sectors\nwhich have remained net emitters, showing deforestation and\nforest degradation have been exceeding the reforestation rates\nthroughout the period and together with increased consumption of\nfossil fuels. Other drivers of emissions are; increased agricultural\nactivities, and demand for fossil fuels in the energy sector.\nOver the period 1990 to 2022, the average annual growth in overall\nemissions has been 4 percent per year including the LULUCF sector.\nGreenhouse gas emission contributions by sector and by type of\ngreenhouse gas are summarized in section 2.2 below.\n1.2.3.\nDescription of emission and removal trends by sector and by\ngas\nEmission trends by Source-Sector\nKenya is amongst developing nations in which Agriculture and\nLULUCF sectors dominates the share of its total greenhouse\ngas emissions. Tables 1.2 provides a summary of sectoral\ngreenhouse gas emissions results for all sectors, and figure 1.3\n| 2 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nshows Emissions trends by sectors without LULUCF, while figure\n1.4 shows emissions trends by sector including LULUCF.\nTable 1.2: Kenya’s sectoral greenhouse gas emissions Summary 1990-2022\nCategories\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2020\n2022\nAnnual\ngrowth\nrate\n~% Change\n1990 – 2022\n3A/C - Agriculture\n15,639.70\n13,732.70\n19,941.10\n40,211.60\n36,102.20\n4%\n131%\n1 - Energy\n7,018.60\n7,767.70\n15,185.00\n20,625.90\n21,503.20\n6%\n206%\n4 - Waste\n2,171.50\n2,953.30\n4,113.40\n5,009.30\n5,237.00\n4%\n141%\n2 - IPPU\n764\n591.2\n1,646.70\n2,026.90\n3,677.20\n12%\n381%\n3B - LULUCF\n -\n14,974.90\n40,456.80\n46,846.30\n20%\n653%\nFigure 1.3: GHG emission trend by sector in GgCO2eq, excluding LULUCF\nFigure 1.4: GHG emission trend by sector in GgCO2eq., including LULUCF\nThe LULUCF sector emitted 46,846.3 GgCO2eq in 2022 (41% of\nthe national emissions). The Agriculture sector was a net emitter\nin 2022 contributing approximately 36,102.2 GgCO2eq or 32% of\nthe national emissions. Thus AFOLU (combined agriculture, land\nuse change and forestry) is the largest contributor to the total\nemissions in Kenya having 73% share. (Tables 1.2 and figure 1.5).\nThe energy sector emitted 21,503.2 GgCO2eq., contributing 20\npercent of the total GHG emissions in 2022. The waste sector\nemitted 5,237.0 Gg CO2eq in 2022, which was 5 percent of the\ntotal GHG emission. The Industrial Processes and Product Use\nemitted 3,677.2 Gg CO2eq or about 3% of total GHG emissions.\n(Tables 1.2 and figure 1.5).\nThe LULUCF emissions grew at average rate of 20% per annum\nwhich is the highest annual rate by sector, followed by Industrial\nprocess emissions at an average rate of 12 % per year. The Energy\nemissions grew at an average rate of 6% per year between 1990\nand 2022. Waste process and Agriculture emissions grew much\nslower at an average rate of 4% per year. (Table 1.2).\nEmissions from the AFOLU sector have been increasing steadily\nsince 1990 to 2022 due steady demand for agricultural land,\ndeforestation activities and use of synthetic fertilizers, and\nincreasing number of livestock. IPPU Emissions have continued\nto grow primarily due to increased CO2 emissions from cement\nproduction (more factories became operational). Emissions\nBiennial Transparency Report 3 |\n\nfrom the Energy Sector had increased over the years largely due\nto increased importation of fossil consuming vehicles in the\ntransport sector.\nFigure 1.5: Kenya`s Sectoral greenhouse gas emissions percentage share of national total emissions in 2022 including LULUCF\nThe current level of emissions from LULUCF is 653 percent\nabove the 1990 level, while IPPU is 381% above that of the\n1990, agriculture sector is 131 percent, and energy sector is\n206% (table 1.2). Detailed results by sector and\nsource categories for each of the inventory period 1990 to 2022\nare provided in chapters 3-6.\nEmission trends by gas\nMethane (CH4) and Carbon dioxide (CO2) dominate Kenya’s\nincrease in greenhouse gas emissions (table 1.3 and figure\n1.6). In 2022, CH4 comprised 51 percent of total CO2 equivalent\n(CO2eq) emissions, whereas CO2 contributed 44 percent and N2O,\n5 percent. Therefore, CO2 and CH4 remain the major greenhouse\ngases in Kenya’s historical emissions profile. Figure 2.6 illustrates\nthe share of emission by gas type.\nFigure 1.6: Kenya’s emissions share by gas in 2022\nTable 1.3: Kenya`s emissions by gas 1990 - 2022 (Gg CO2 Eq)\nGHG Type\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2020\n2022\n% change\n1990 - 2022\nCO2\n6,622.4\n7,136.2\n29,334.8\n58,674.7\n67,114.2\n913%\nCH4\n17,036.2\n15,865.0\n23,843.3\n45,599.8\n42,127.5\n147%\nN2O\n1,935.2\n2,043.8\n2,682.9\n4,055.9\n4,124.4\n113%\nTotal Emissions\n(Gg CO2eq)\n25,593.7\n25,045.0\n55,861.1\n108,330.4\n113,366.0\n343%\nThe growth in CH4 emissions can be associated with increased\nnumber of livestock population. The growth in CO2 represents\nthe increased emissions from the LULUCF and energy sectors,\nin particular transport sub-sector.

In 2010, the Government of Kenya (GoK) enacted a\nnew constitution which created a devolved, two-tier government\nconsisting of a National government and County governments. The\nconstitution and the new government structure have established\n47 constitutionally distinct County Governments that have defined\nspheres of power and functions.\nThe Government of Kenya has established a structure that assigns\nthe coordination of climate change affairs to the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Climate Change and Forestry, State Department for\nEnvironment and Climate Change. Overarching policy, coordination\nand oversight of climate change affairs is performed by the\nNational Climate Change Council, chaired by the President.\nThe Climate Change Directorate, established by the Climate\nChange Act, 20161 , is the lead agency of the government on\nnational climate change plans and actions to deliver operational\ncoordination. The Directorate performs coordination work through\nthe Climate Change Units established in all ministries, counties,\ndepartments and agencies.\nPopulation Profile\nKenya is a middle-income developing country in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica with a stable democratic government. Kenya has a 2022\nprojected population of 50,622,914 based on the Kenya population\nand housing census conducted in 20192 . As highlighted above,\nthere are 47 county governments with different population\nprojections. Population is projected to increase during the entire\nforecast period, with an estimated population of 70,179,943 by\n2045. The six top counties expected to experience the highest\npercentage of the population are Samburu, Tana River, Narok,\nLamu, Wajir and Turkana. In terms of numbers, Nairobi, Kiambu,\nNakuru, Narok and Kakamega counties are expected to have the\nhighest increase.\nData from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) on\nhousehold projections show that there were approximately\n13,478,733 households in 2022 and are expected to increase to\n15,908,968 by 2030.\nGeographical Profile\nKenya is a tropical, water-scarce country located on the equator\nin East Africa. It shares international borders with Ethiopia to\nthe North, South Sudan to the North-West, Uganda to the West,\nTanzania to the South and Somalia to the East.\nThe total surface area is about 610,000 square kilometres\ncomprising of land area of approximately 580,609 sq.km, water\narea of approximately 11,362 sq.km and terrestrial water area\nof approximately 18,029 sq.km.\n| 6 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nClimate Profile\nKenya has a number of distinct climatic and ecological zones, linked\nin part to its widely varying topography. The coastal region in the\nEast, bordering the Indian Ocean, is characterized by predominantly\nflat plains with warm, humid weather. The plains give way to vast\nsprawling savannah in the South-East lowlands, dominated by\ngrassy ecosystems with an arid and semi-arid climate3.\n3 https://www.climateimpacts.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KE_FINAL_12-Apr_ONLINE.pdf \nKenya has two main wet seasons: March to May is referred to\nas the “long rains”, and October to December as the “short rains”.\nParts of the country experience a third wet season between June\nand August.\nKenya’s landscape can be categorized into three major climatological\nzones, distinguished primarily by the distribution of rainfall: arid\nand semi-arid, tropical, and temperate (see figure 2.1).\n\nFigure 2.1: Kenya’s topography and climate are highly diverse. Situated between 5° N and 5° S latitude and 34° E and 42° E longitude, Kenya’s geography spans low-lying\ncoastal regions up to the towering peaks of Mount Kenya in the central highlands.\nThe arid and semi-arid lands are characterized by low and erratic\nrainfall, strong winds and intense sunlight for most of the year.\nThey provide generally hostile environmental conditions and\nfrequently experience drought. Kenya’s temperate zones are\ntypically highland areas, such as the Lake Victoria basin and\nMount Kenya regions.\nThese zones are characterized by cool temperatures and relatively\nhigh rainfall. The tropical zones, predominantly the plateaus,\nreceive moderate rain during the two main wet seasons and\nserve as transition zones between temperate and arid areas\n(see figure 2.2).\n\nFigure 2.2: Kenya has three main climatic zones, according to the Köppen–Geiger classification. Arid and semi-arid regions (orange) cover most of the land area, with the\ntropical (red) and temperate (green) climates less dominant.\nKenya is exposed to climate hazards or the actual biophysical\nevents that are driven by climate change. Slow onset climate\nhazards, such as temperature increase, drought, changes in\nprecipitation patterns, and sea level rise have intensified.\nBiennial Transparency Report 7 |\n\nAcute climate hazards, such as extreme precipitation, floods,\nlandslides, and wildfires, are expected to increase in frequency\nand severity in Kenya.\nClimate change is, therefore, causing an increase in average global\ntemperatures, increasing temperatures, changing precipitation\npatterns, and rising sea levels, creating significant environmental\nand economic disruption and adversely affecting Kenyans. The\nimpacts of climate change and climate-related disasters are felt at\nthe household level through food insecurity, damage to property,\nincreased prices of food and fuel, and declining access to water\nand other environmental services.\nEconomy\nThe Kenya Vision 2030 aimed to achieve a 10% annual GDP\ngrowth rate by 2012 and sustain it up to the year 2030. However,\nbetween 2012 and 2022, annual GDP growth rate averaged 4.8%.\nThis performance fell short of the target of 10 percent annual\ngrowth due to various factors, including: the adverse effects of\nclimate change, which has resulted to recurring drought and\ninvasion of pests and diseases; rising oil prices; exchange rate\nvolatility; the COVID-19 pandemic; geo-political conflicts, terrorist\nattacks and piracy incidents. Kenya’s annual GDP growth rate in\ncomparison to lower middle-income and upper middle-income\ncategories between 2007 and 2022 is presented in Figure 2.3.\n\nFigure 2.3: Kenya’s annual GDP growth in comparison to Lower Middle-income and Upper Middle-income categories, 2007-2022\nKenya made progress towards the attainment of a middle-income\ncounty status as envisaged in the Kenya Vision 2030. The country\ntransitioned from a low-income status to a lower middle-income\nstatus upon attaining a GDP per capita of US$ 1,430 in 2014.\nThe GDP per capita improved to US$ 2,240 in 2022. However,\nKenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita performance\nhas been lower than the average for lower middle-income and\nupper middle-income categories between 2007 and 2022, as\nshown in Figure 2.4\n\nFigure 2.4: Kenya’s GDP per capita (USD) in comparison to Lower Middle-Income and Upper Middle-income categories, 2007 - 2022\nSectors with significant contribution to economic growth in Kenya\ninclude Agriculture and livestock; Manufacturing; Tourism; Trade;\nBusiness process outsourcing; and Financial services.\nAgriculture and livestock sector aims to promote an innovative,\ncommercially oriented and modern agriculture. The sector majorly\ncontributed towards the attainment of food and nutrition security,\nincome generation, employment creation, and enhancing export\nearnings. Agriculture contribution to GDP marginally decreased from\n21.7 % in 2007 to 21.2% in 2022. The performance was attributed\nto adverse weather conditions in some years and increasing costs\nof farm inputs. The share contribution of agriculture, forestry and\nfishing to GDP in Kenya compared to lower-middle-income and\nupper middle-income countries between 2007 and 2022 was\nhigher, indicating that the country is still heavily dependent on\nagriculture (See figure 2.5).\n| 8 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nFigure 2.5: Share contribution of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing to GDP in Kenya compared to Lower Middle-Income and Upper Middle-Income categories, 2007 - 2022\nKenya aims to have a robust, diversified and competitive\nmanufacturing sector. The sector supports the country’s socioeconomic development agenda through job creation, foreign\nexchange generation and foreign direct investment attraction.\nThe contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP declined\nfrom 10.4% in 2007 to 7.8 per cent in 2022 against a target of\n15%. The decline was due to high cost of production, competition\nfrom counterfeit goods, low technology adoption and recurring\ndrought. The sector facilitated export-oriented investment by\ndeveloping Athi River textile hub; modernizing Rivatex Textile\nFactory; and initiating the establishment of Special Economic\nZones in Dongo Kundu and Naivasha. The share contribution of\nmanufacturing to GDP in Kenya in comparison to lower middleincome and upper middle-income countries between 2007 and\n2022 (see figure 2.6).\n\nFigure 2.6: Share contribution of Manufacturing to GDP in Kenya compared to Lower Middle-Income and Upper Middle-Income categories, 2007 - 2022\n2.1.2.\nInstitutional Arrangements\nDue to these impacts which continue to disrupt the country’s\neconomy, Kenya has prioritized climate change response and\nput in place an elaborate policy, legal and institutional framework\non climate change. Kenya communicated an ambitious updated\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the secretariat of\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC) in December 2020 to demonstrate its global commitment\nto addressing the adverse effects of climate change in the context\nof sustainable development and eradication of poverty.\nKenya has established an elaborate institutional arrangement\nfor addressing the adverse impacts of climate change and\nimplementing the NDC. The institutional arrangement takes a\nmulti-stakeholder approach recognizing the role of state and\nnon-state actors at both the national and county levels.\na) Climate Change Act 2016 (Revised Edition 2023)\nKenya enacted its climate change law, the Climate Change Act, in\n2016, which it revised in 2023 to integrate carbon markets. The Act\nis applied for the development, management, implementation and\nregulation of mechanisms to enhance climate change resilience\nand low carbon development for the sustainable development\nof Kenya.\nThe 2023 revised edition of the Climate Change Act 2016 provides\nan elaborate institutional arrangement for implementing and\ntracking the Kenya Nationally Determined Contributions. The Act\nestablished the National Climate Change Council, which provides\noverarching national climate change coordination mechanisms.\nThe Council is comprised of members drawn from both state and\nnon-state actors, including the youth, marginalised communities,\nand academia, to facilitate stakeholder engagement in policy,\ncoordination and oversight of climate change response in Kenya.\nThe Act further establishes the Climate Change Directorate as\nBiennial Transparency Report 9 |\n\nthe lead agency of the government on national climate change\nplans and actions to deliver operational coordination of climate\nchange response. The directorate works with the climate change\nunits established in other ministries, counties, departments, and\nagencies to deliver operational coordination using an integrated\napproach as provided for under the Act.\nb) National Climate Change Action Plan (NCCAP)\nThe Climate Change Act 2016 provides for the Cabinet Secretary\nresponsible for climate change affairs to formulate, through\npublic consultation, a National Climate Change Action Plan. The\nClimate Change Action Plan prioritizes climate change response\nmeasures and actions over a five-year period and is aligned with\nthe election cycles to facilitate mainstreaming of government’s\ndevelopment priorities in the context of sustainable development\nand efforts to eradicate poverty. The action plan also prioritizes\nactions for the implementation of the NDC with an elaborate\nimplementation and reporting framework.\n2.2.\tDescription of Kenya’s NDC under Article 4 of the Paris\nAgreement\nKenya submitted her first Nationally Determined Contribution\n(NDC) with instruments for ratification to the Paris Agreement\non 28th December 2016. In her first NDC, Kenya committed to\nreducing emissions by 30% against a Business as Usual (BAU)\nscenario of 143 MtCO2eq by 2030.\nKenya updated her first NDC in 2020 which seeks to abate GHG\nemissions by 32% relative to the BAU scenario of 143 MtCO2eq\nby 2030, in line with Kenya’s sustainable development agenda\nand national circumstances.\nThe NDC is an economy-wide absolute GHG emissions target.

Over the NDC implementation\nperiod, climate change actions will be implemented through\nselected and prioritized measures covering both mitigation and\nadaptation.\nThis section outlines a few selected significant policies and\nmeasures, actions and plans, by sector, including those with\nmitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and\neconomic diversification plans relating to the implementation\nof the NDC:\n| 22 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n2.4.1.\nAgriculture Sector\nWithin the Agriculture sector, the overarching policy is the Agricultural\nSector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS) 2019-2029.\nThis strategy is designed to support agricultural productivity, ensure\nfood security, and contribute to environmental sustainability. It\nprovides guidelines for soil conservation, improvement of soil\nhealth, and the adoption of best practices in soil management to\noptimize agricultural outputs. The objective of the strategy is to\ncontribute to economically and environmentally viable, and socially\nacceptable development opportunities for agricultural production\nin Kenya to reduce poverty and improve food security through\nimproved soil management.\nThe strategy is implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and\nLivestock Development and other key stakeholders including other\nMinistries and agencies such as Kenya Agricultural Livestock and\nResearch Organization (KALRO); Ministry of Environment, Climate\nChange and Forestry; National Land Commission (NLC); National\nEnvironment Management Authority (NEMA); Kenya Bureau of\nStandards (KEBS), Radiation Board, among others.\nThe Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy (KCSAS 2017-2026)\nis the main policy instrument geared towards the implementation\nof the NDC through initiatives and measures such as:\na.\nReducing the rate of emissions from livestock (manure and\nenteric fermentation).\nb.\nReducing the rate of emissions from rice production systems.\nc.\nProviding accurate, timely and reliable climate/weather\ninformation to inform decisions of actors on crops, livestock\nand fisheries value chains.\nd.\nPromoting crop varieties, livestock and fish breeds and\ntree species that are adapted to varied weather conditions\nand tolerant to associated emerging pests and diseases\ne.\nTechnology development, dissemination and adoption\nalong crops, livestock, fisheries and forestry value chains\nf.\nDiversification of enterprises and alternative livelihoods\ng.\nEnhancing productivity and profitability of agricultural\nenterprises.\nThrough the Agricultural Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy\n(ASTGS) 2019-2029, the sector has developed several plans and\nimplemented actions that directly and indirectly support climate\nactions. These include:\n1.\nAgricultural Soil Management Policy (NASMP)- (2020) - This\npolicy is designed to support agricultural productivity, ensure\nfood security, and contribute to environmental sustainability.\nIt provides guidelines for soil conservation, improvement\nof soil health, and the adoption of best practices in soil\nmanagement to optimize agricultural outputs.\n2.\nAgriculture (Farm Forestry) Rules, 2009 – These are\nregulations established under the Agriculture Act in Kenya\nto encourage the integration of forestry practices within\nagricultural landscapes. These rules are part of Kenya’s\nbroader strategy to enhance environmental conservation,\nincrease forest cover, and improve agricultural productivity\nthrough sustainable land use practices. The rules mandate\nfarmers to allocate a portion of their land for tree planting\nand management, contributing to ecological balance, soil\nfertility improvement, and climate change mitigation.\n3.\nSessional Paper No. 3 of 2020 on the Livestock Policy\n– Policy aims to utilize livestock resources for food and\nnutrition security, improved livelihoods while safeguarding\nthe environment.\nIn support of these interventions, the sector implemented the following measures and initiatives as described in the table below:\nTable 2.6: Overview of the mitigation policies and actions in the Agricultural Sector.\nBiennial Transparency Report 23 |\n\n Mitigation policies and measures, actions and plans, including those with mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification plans,\nrelated to implementing and achieving a nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement\nName\nDescription\nObjectives\nType of\nInstrument\n(Regulatory,\nEconomic,\nVoluntary,\nother)\nStatus\n(Planned,\nadopted,\nImplemented)\nSector(s)\naffected\nGases\naffected\nStart year of\nimplementation\nImplementing\nentity or\nentities\nEstimates of GHG emission\nreductions (kt CO2 eq) (j, k)\nAchieved | Expected\nKenya\nClimate\nSmart\nAgriculture\nStrategy\n(KCSAS 2017-\n2026)\nThe recurrent droughts\nand rising temperatures\nattributed to climate\nchange continue to\nexert more pressure on\nfisheries resources due\nto reduction of water\nsupply, and increased\nevaporation of water\nin lakes and rivers.\nThe country therefore\nrequires transformation\nof its agricultural\nsystems to make them\nmore productive, resilient\nand competitive in\ngenerating incomes\nunder a changing\nclimate.

The Least Cost Power Development Plan is a rolling\n20-year plan prepared biennially (since 2011), and five-year\nmedium-term plans compiled to guide particularly the expansion\nof the electricity sector.\nIn 2020, the plan was updated with emphasis on the prioritization\nof renewable energy options for generation of electricity. The\nexpansion of the grid (electricity network) has enabled the\ndispatch of more renewable electricity and improved the grid’s\nrobustness to take up more renewable energy sources especially\nwith regards to the instantaneous, daily and seasonal variability.\nSubsequent updates of the plan have sustained this trajectory\nachieving 89.8% and 87.7% electricity generated from renewable\nenergy sources in the years 2021 and 2022 respectively.\nBiennial Transparency Report 31 |\n\nTable 2.7: Overview of the mitigation policies and actions in the Energy Sector..\n Mitigation policies and measures, actions and plans, including those with mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification plans,\nrelated to implementing and achieving a nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement\nName\nDescription\nObjectives\nType of\nInstrument\n(Regulatory,\nEconomic,\nVoluntary,\nother)\nStatus\n(Planned,\nadopted,\nImplemented)\nSector(s)\naffected\nGases\naffected\nStart year of\nimplementation\nImplementing\nentity or\nentities\nEstimates of GHG emission\nreductions (kt CO2 eq) (j, k)\nAchieved | Expected\nLeast Cost\nPower\nDevelopment\nPlan\nThe Government through\nthe Ministry responsible\nfor Energy has over the\nyears been undertaking\npower development\nplanning for the country\nthrough the Least Cost\nPower Development Plan\n(LCPDP).\nUpdates of the Least\nCost Power Development\nPlan are prepared\nbiennially (since 2011)\ncovering 20-year periods,\nand five-year mediumterm plans compiled in\nalternate years.\nThe 20202022 plan\nemphasized\nthe\nprioritization\nof renewable\nenergy options\nfor generation\nof electricity.\nThe expansion\nof the grid\n(electricity\nnetwork)\nhas enabled\nthe dispatch\nof more\nrenewable\nelectricity and\nimproved its\nrobustness\nsources\nespecially with\nrelation to the\nvariability of\nthe RE to take\nup more of\nthe renewable\nenergy.\nEconomic\nRegulatory\nAdopted\nEnergy\nCO2\n2011\nMinistry of\nEnergy and\nPetroleum\nEnergy and\nPetroleum\nRegulatory\nAuthority\n(EPRA)\nKenya Power\nand Lighting\nCompany\n(KPLC)\nKenya\nElectricity\nGenerating\nCompany\n(KENGEN)\nGeothermal\nDevelopment\nCompany\n(GDC)\nKenya\nElectricity\nTransmission\nCompany\n(KETRACO)\n18,000\n904.316\n| 32 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n2.4.3.\nTransport Sector\nGHG emissions from the transport sector have always constituted\na significant share of the total emissions, consistently being\nthe most significant source of emissions in the energy sector,\nparticularly due to its reliance on fossil fuels. With population\ngrowth, modernization of society and increasing economic\nprosperity, there has been a sustained surge in motor vehicle\nownership and use, which is a significant contributor to GHG\nemissions, primarily due to the reliance on petrol and diesel\nvehicles. Increased economic activities mean more goods and\npeople need to be transported, further raising emissions. As one\nof the main contributors to emissions in the country, the transport\nsector is at the heart of achieving the NDC target.\nThe Government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda,\nwhich is currently being implemented through the Fourth Medium\nTerm Plan 2023 – 2027 of the Kenya Vision 2030 Agenda,\nrecognizes the role e-mobility could play in the attainment of\nnational development and environmental goals. With the objective\nof achieving a low carbon and efficient transportation system in\nthe NDC, the transport sector aims to promote several identified\nmitigation measures such as: Transfer of freight from road to\nrail; Transition to e-mobility; Electrification of the Standard gauge\nrailway between Nairobi and Mombasa by 2022, among others.\nThe total length of the rail network in the country is 2,778 km\ncomprising both the meter-gauge track and the standard-gauge\ntrack. In 2017, the construction of Phase I of the Standard Gauge\nRailway spanning 472 km of track from the port city of Mombasa\nto Nairobi was completed, this has significantly reduced freight\nand passenger tariffs and travel time and led to a significant shift\nof freight and passengers from road to rail. The cargo transported\nusing the railway system increased from 1,380,000 tonnes in 2016\nto 6,090,000 tonnes in 2022. The passenger per km increased\nfrom 113 million in 2016 to 2,392 million in 2022. (source KNBS\nEconomic Survey 2018 and 2023). This is observed in the trend\nof emissions for heavy-duty vehicles which declined in 2017.\nThe National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (2020)\nenvisions that by 2025, 5 % of all registered vehicles in Kenya will\nbe electric powered.\nAs of 2022, the sector was not able to implement most of the\nplanned actions for the achievement of the NDC, due to inadequate\nfinancial support.\nBiennial Transparency Report 33 |\n\nTable 2.8: Overview of the mitigation policies and actions in the Transport Sector.\n Mitigation policies and measures, actions and plans, including those with mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification plans,\nrelated to implementing and achieving a nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement\nName\nDescription\nObjectives\nType of\nInstrument\n(Regulatory,\nEconomic,\nVoluntary,\nother)\nStatus\n(Planned,\nadopted,\nImplemented)\nSector(s)\naffected\nGases\naffected\nStart year of\nimplementation\nImplementing\nentity or\nentities\nEstimates of GHG emission\nreductions (kt CO2 eq) (j, k)\nAchieved | Expected\nTransfer of\nfreight from\nroad to rail\nbetween\nNairobi and\nMombasa\n30% of freight from\nMombasa to Nairobi\nshifted from road to rail.\nThe transfer of freight\nfrom road to rail between\nNairobi and Mombasa\nin Kenya is part of the\nKenya Railway Expansion\nproject, which aims to\nreduce road damage and\nprovide a faster and safer\nintercity transportation\nsystem.\nThe project includes\nthe Mombasa-NairobiMalaba Corridor, which\nconnects the Port of\nMombasa to Nairobi and\nMalaba, Uganda.\nReduce fuel\nconsumption\nand fuel\noverhead costs\nEconomic\nAdopted\nTransport\nCrosscutting\nCO2\n2018\nMinistry of\nRoads and\nTransport\nKenya Railways\nNE\nNE\n| 34 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n2.4.4.\nLand Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Sector\nThe Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector plays\na critical role in achieving the NDC. The sector is central to Kenya’s\nclimate action, providing significant mitigation potential through\nsustainable forest management, afforestation, reforestation, and\nlandscape restoration initiatives. These actions are complemented\nby policies and measures that prioritize climate-smart agriculture,\nagroforestry, and nature-based solutions, ensuring the integration\nof adaptation co-benefits. Additionally, economic diversification\nplans focusing on green jobs and sustainable livelihoods enhance\nthe sector’s contribution to emissions reductions while fostering\ncommunity resilience and environmental sustainability.\nThis section outlines the key mitigation policies, actions, and plans\nfor the sector, designed to advance Kenya’s NDC commitments\nwhile addressing broader socio-economic and environmental\nobjectives. These include the commitment to progressively\nachieve a minimum of 10% tree cover across the total land area;\nefforts towards achieving land degradation neutrality; scaling up\nnature-based solutions (NBS) for mitigation and enhancement\nof REDD+ activities.\nIn its efforts to achieve 10% tree cover, Kenya implemented the\nstrategy for increasing tree cover to at least 10% of the total land\narea by 2022. As a result, approximately 80,398.5 hectares were\nsuccessfully planted with trees through afforestation, reforestation,\nand agroforestry initiatives. On-the-ground initiatives that were\nimplemented, such as the Green Zones Support Project Phase II\nand the Adopt a Forest Initiative, actively engage stakeholders to\nrestore degraded landscapes, enhance forest cover, and integrate\ntree planting with agricultural practices.\nKenya, in its efforts to enhance REDD+ activities, finalized its\nREDD+ Strategy in 2021, which outlines an ambitious framework\nfor implementing national REDD+ activities to reduce emissions\nfrom deforestation and forest degradation while promoting\nconservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement\nof forest carbon stocks. The strategy identifies key areas of\nfocus to address deforestation and forest degradation, including\nscaling up afforestation, reforestation, and landscape restoration\nprograms. It also emphasizes improving governance and policy\nimplementation to curb the conversion of forests to other land\nuses and increasing the productivity of public plantation forests.\nIn addition, the strategy seeks to enhance efficiency, effectiveness,\nand skill development across forest-related value chains, ensuring\nsustainable utilization of forest resources.\nRecognizing the importance of financial resources, the strategy\nprioritizes the mobilization of funding to support the implementation\nof REDD+ initiatives in Kenya. It is worth noting that Kenya has\nnot implemented REDD+ at the national level. As of 2022, Kenya\nwas at the REDD+ readiness phase. However, several site-level\nREDD+ activities, such as the Kasigau Corridor REDD project\n(phases I and II), Mikoko Pamoja Mangrove Restoration in Gazi\nBay and the Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project, are being implemented\nin the voluntary carbon markets.\nAdditionally, Kenya has operationalized other policies and measures,\nactions and plans related to implementing and achieving her NDC\nwithin the forestry sector. The National Forestry Programme\n(2016-2030) aims to enhance forest restoration, agroforestry and\nsustainable land use, contributing to socio-economic growth and\nclimate resilience. Community involvement is also paramount\nin enhancing forest conservation and management efforts and\nis encouraged through legislative measures like the Forests\n(Participation in Sustainable Forest Management) Rules, 2009,\nwhich promote collaborative forest management between local\ncommunities and the Kenya Forest Service (KFS). This has borne\nfruits in the management of existing forests reducing conversions\nto other uses and reforesting degraded areas.\nAll these, and many other efforts within the sector, collectively\ntarget greenhouse gas reductions, particularly carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and increasing\nof sinks across the land-use, land-use change, and forestry\n(LULUCF) sectors.\nBiennial Transparency Report 35 |\n\nTable 2.9: Overview of the mitigation policies and actions in the LULUCF sector.\n Mitigation policies and measures, actions and plans, including those with mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification plans,\nrelated to implementing and achieving a nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement\nName\nDescription\nObjectives\nType of\nInstrument\n(Regulatory,\nEconomic,\nVoluntary,\nother)\nStatus\n(Planned,\nadopted,\nImplemented)\nSector(s)\naffected\nGases\naffected\nStart year of\nimplementation\nImplementing\nentity or\nentities\nEstimates of GHG emission\nreductions (kt CO2 eq) (j, k)\nAchieved | Expected\nStrategy\ntowards the\nattainment\nof 10% tree\ncover by 2022\nA comprehensive\napproach to expand\nforest and tree\ncover across public\nand private lands\nthrough afforestation,\nreforestation and\nlandscape restoration\nTo increase the\ncountry’s tree\ncover to 10% by\n2022\nRegulatory\nEconomic\nImplemented\nForestry\nAgriculture\nCO2\n2018\nMinistry of\nEnvironment,\nClimate\nChange and\nForestry\nKenya Forest\nService\nNE\nNE\nNational\nREDD+\nStrategy 2021\nStrategy for REDD+\nimplementation in Kenya\nTo Scale-up\nreforestation\nand enhance\ngovernance\nand policy;\nand mobilize\nfinance for\nREDD+\nRegulatory\nEconomic\nPlanned\nForestry\nCO2\n2021\nMinistry of\nEnvironment,\nClimate\nChange and\nForestry\nKenya Forest\nService (KFS)\nDevelopment\npartners\nNE\nNE\n| 36 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n2.4.5.\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) Sector\nThe Government initiated the development of policies and\nmeasures in industrial processes and product use to enhance\nmanufacturing sector resource efficiency and introduce a circular\neconomy to reduce material extraction used in production.\nFurther setting up structures for extended producer responsibility\nimplementing the Sustainable Waste Management Policy 2021\nand National Sustainable Waste Management Act 2022.

(2024). Kenya’s Adaptation Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Forestry,\nNairobi, Kenya.\nKenya is a signatory to both the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement\nthat it adopted in 2015. The country recognizes the challenge\nassociated with addressing the causes and impacts of climate\nchange globally and locally. As such, Kenya through its Nationally\nDetermined Contributions on adaptation (NDC) is committed to\ntaking action to contribute to the implementation of the Global\nGoal on Adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening\nresilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change. This\nchapter aims to communicate the country’s progress towards all\nsubstantive aspects of the Paris Agreement regarding adaptation\n(under Article 7) and loss and damage (under Article 8).\nPreparation of this chapter was guided by Decision 18/CMA.1\nchapter IV of the UNFCCC as well as Kenya’s National Adaptation\nPlan 2015-2030 (NAP) whose vision is “enhanced climate resilience\ntowards vision 2030”.4 The communication in this chapter builds\non Kenya’s updated NDC, 2020 and draws on the recent adaptation\ntechnical analysis report (ATAR) for the National Climate Change\nAction Plan (NCCAP) III 2023-2027, NCCAP progress reports,\nand Kenya’s draft Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC.5\nThis chapter provides information on Kenya’s national context,\nrisk and vulnerability profile; national adaptation priorities and\nbarriers; adaptation strategies, policies, goals and plans to integrate\nadaptation into Kenya’s Climate Action; implementation progress,\nresults evaluation and learning; and averting, minimizing and\naddressing loss and damage associated with climate change\nimpacts.\n3.2.\tNational Context, Risk, and Vulnerability Profile\n3.2.1.\nNational Circumstances relevant to adaptation actions\nGeographic Profile\nKenya is located in the East African region between latitude 5°\nNorth and 5° South and is bisected by the equator, and between\nlongitudes 34°E and 42° East. It borders South Sudan, Ethiopia, and\nSomalia to the north; Uganda to the west; Tanzania to the south;\nand the Indian Ocean to the east. The total land area is 569,137\nsquare kilometres. Mount Kenya is the highest point in Kenya at\n5,199 metres above sea level and the lowest point is at sea level\non the Indian Ocean. The country is situated within the Greater\nHorn of Africa which is a generally dry region characterised by\nfrequent droughts that are punctuated by heavy rainfall events\nthat often result in flash floods.

The urban population was about 28 percent. The census\ndetermined that Kenya had a population density of 82 persons\nper km2. In 2019, Kenya youths under the age of 35 years made\nup 75 percent of the population and were comprised of children\n(0-14 years) - 18,541,982 (39.0 percent), adolescents (10-19 years)\n- 11,631,929 (24.5 percent), and youths (18-34 years) - 13,777,600\n(29.0 percent).

The working age population (15-64 years)\nwas 27,151,134 (57.1 percent) persons in 2019.6\nWeather and Climate\nKenya is made up of seven agro-ecological zones which experience\nvarying climates and weather patterns.7 The arid regions of the\ncountry receive annual average rainfall of between 200 and 500\nmm and annual temperatures range from 23°C to 34°C. The semiarid areas experience an average annual rainfall of 600 to 1,000\nmm and are slightly cooler in temperature. The arid and semi-arid\nlands are characterized by low and erratic rainfall, strong winds\nand intense sunlight for most of the year.8 The coastal climatic\nzone, a band approximately 16 kilometres wide, is humid all year\nround with an average annual temperature range of 22°C to 30°C\nand an average rainfall of between 1,000 and 1,250 mm. The\nmost temperate zones are the Central and Western highlands and\nparts of the central Rift Valley with annual rainfall levels averaging\nbetween 950 and 3,000 mm and average annual temperatures\nranging between 14°C to 28°C.\nKenya Meteorological Department (KMD) data indicates that\nKenya’s temperatures vary, with the highlands experiencing\nconsiderably cooler temperatures than the coastal and lowland\nregions. The months of June to August are characterised by\ncooler temperatures while the highest temperatures are typically\nexperienced during the month of March. Kenya’s annual rainfall\nfollows a bimodal seasonal pattern, commonly referred to as\nthe “long rains” season occurring in March, April, and May, and\nthe “short rains” season, occurring in October, November, and\nDecember. Another season takes place from June to August\nover the coastal region and the Highlands West of the Rift Valley.\nAverage annual precipitation in Kenya is typically 680 mm, ranging\nfrom less than 250 mm in parts of the northern arid and semi-arid\nland (ASAL) areas to about 2,000 mm in the high rainfall zone\nin the Western region, that includes the country’s productive\nagricultural land.9\nFigure 3.1: Observed Annual Precipitation in Kenya 1991 - 2020 (Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)2\n| 42 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nFigure 3.2: Observed Annual Average Mean Surface Air Temperature in Kenya 1991 – 2020 (Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)3\n10 Rathore, V.

Kenya: IMF Country Report No. 22/382. https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/ Publications/CR/2022/English/1KENEA2022003.ashx\nKenya’s ASALs generally experience hostile weather and\nenvironmental conditions and frequently experience drought,\n10while the country’s temperate zones are characterized by cool\ntemperatures and relatively high rainfall. The tropical zones,\npredominantly the plateaus, receive moderate rain during the\ntwo main wet seasons and serve as transition zones between\ntemperate and arid areas.11 According to the World Bank’s climate\nprofile analysis for Kenya, the high rainfall temperate zone, which\nreceives more than 1,000 mm of annual rainfall, is the productive\nagricultural land. It occupies less than 20% of the country’s land\narea and carries approximately 80% of the population.12\nThe Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (ATAR 2023-2027)\n13reported that Kenya experienced below average rainfall in most\nareas and drought in the ASALs between 2014 and 2023. In early\n2023, Kenya, like other countries in the Horn of Africa, experienced\nthe longest and most severe drought on record, the result of a\nculmination of five consecutive failed rain seasons in most parts,\nthe longest such sequence in 40 years.14\nThe severity of the drought was lessened with the onset of\nthe 2024 long rains (March–May), which were heavier than\naverage and caused loss of life and significant damage to\nproperty. Communities with high levels of climate vulnerability\nare particularly impacted by sequential climate events; where a\nsubsequent climate hazard (i.e., extreme rainfall) impacts the\nsocio-ecological system before full recovery from the previous\nhazard (i.e., drought). Compound drought-extreme rainfall events\nare occurring with greater frequency and intensity, reducing the\navailable recovery time and eroding the capacity for resilience.\n\nFigure 3.3: Observed Annual Precipitation of Kenya for 1901 -2022(Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)\nEconomic Profile\nKenya is a lower-middle-income economy and among the fastestgrowing economies in Africa. Kenya’s gross domestic product\n(GDP) was USD 115.08 billion and GDP per capita was USD 2,220\nin October 2024.15 The World Bank reported that Kenya’s GDP\nincreased by 4.8 percent in 2022 and 5.4 percent in 2023; but is\nexpected to slow down to 5.0 percent in 2024. The poverty rate\n($2.15 international poverty rate) is projected to decline from 35.1\npercent in 2023 to 34.3 percent in 2024. Kenya has a favourable\nmedium-term economic outlook with projected GDP growth of\n5.2 percent for 2024-2026, although the economy is susceptible\nto climate-related risks, such as extreme weather conditions.16\nThe agricultural sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting\nfor approximately 20% of Kenya’s GDP.17 The country’s highlands\nhost significant farmlands as well as the majority of the population.\nThe highlands are relatively cool and agriculturally rich, and\nare largely dominated by commercial and small-holder farms.\nPrincipal cash crops include tea, coffee, flowers, vegetables,\nBiennial Transparency Report 43 |\n\npyrethrum.

There is rapid urbanisation\nwith projections showing that over 50 percent of the population\nwill live in urban areas by 2030.19 Kenya is a member of the East\nAfrican Community (EAC) regional economic bloc and the Common\nMarket for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) trade blocs.\nImpact of the Country Profile on Adaptive Capacity 4\nThe geographical context of Kenya in the Greater Horn of Africa\nregion exposes the country to a level of climate variability that\npresents significant economic risks. The country experiences\nfrequent droughts that are punctuated by heavy rainfall events\nthat often result in flash floods. More than 70% of disasters\nfrom natural hazards are estimated to be attributable to extreme\nclimatic events.20These disasters include major droughts that\noccur every 10 years, and moderate droughts or floods every\nthree to four years. The repeating cycles of floods and droughts\nhave had devastating socioeconomic impacts and high economic\ncosts, have eroded the adaptive capacity of communities and\necosystems, and have negatively impacted livelihoods and the\noverall economy of the country. The 2008 – 2011 drought is\nestimated to have cost Kenya USD12.1 billion, including USD\n805.6 million for the destruction of physical and durable assets.21\nDroughts have affected more people than floods and have had\nthe greatest economic impact (averaging 8% of GDP every five\nyears).22Although droughts often affect the whole country, the\nmost severe impacts are felt in the country’s highly arid zones,\nwhich include many of the poorest counties. The local economies\nin these counties depend heavily on pastoralism and the resulting\nrangeland degradation and loss of livestock erodes their capacity\nto cope and adapt to further climate impacts.\nIn Kenya, agriculture is the main productive sector and is critical\nfor food security and economic stability. The sector accounts for\napproximately 20% of Kenya’s GDP and employs more than 40%\nof the total population and more than 70% of the rural population.\nIt largely remains rainfed making it exposed and vulnerable to\nthe changing climate. Drought and floods cause significant\nloss of livestock, crops, and harvest resulting to loss of income\nand livelihoods at household level, and episodes of acute food\ninsecurity, particularly in the arid counties. Climate impacts on\nthe agriculture sector heavily affect young people by reducing\nincomes and limiting their transformation towards climate-smart\nor modernized agriculture which is capital-intensive.\nSocio-economic losses associated with climate change in Kenya\nover the past decade amounted to between 3% and 5% of GDP\nper annum.23Modelling estimates in the LTLED strategy suggest\nthat Kenya’s losses could rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% of GDP\nper annum between 2021-2050.24Kenya could lose up to USD 11\nbillion each year because of climate change, however the modelling\nindicates that about one-third of this loss can be averted through\nadaptation action.25 As such, adaptation is a primary concern\nwith respect to climate change.5\n3.2.2.\tInstitutional Arrangements and Governance\nIInclusion of diverse actors in climate change action, and particularly\nin adaptation supports compliance with the Constitution of\nKenya 2010, the Climate Change Act, 2016, and other subsidiary\nlegislation that provides for public participation in such matters.\nBelow is a summary of key institutions and actors responsible\nfor adaptation in Kenya and their roles.\nThe National Climate Change Council\nThe National Climate Change Council, established under the\nClimate Change Act, 2016 and chaired by the President, guides\nthe implementation of adaptation action and receives at least biannual reports on the implementation of NCCAPs. The council’s\nmandate is to provide legislative and policy direction, supervision,\noversight and guidance on climate change across all levels of\ngovernment. The Council will administer the climate finance\nmechanism (Climate Change Fund), including approving requests\nfor funding, making funding allocation decisions, and improving\nthe tracking and coordination of climate finance.26\nThe Climate Change Directorate\nIn Kenya, climate action is coordinated by the Climate Change\nDirectorate (CCD), State Department of Environment and Climate\nChange, in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and\nForestry. The CCD is the National Focal Point for the UNFCCC and\nworks under the guidance of various climate change policies and\nlegislative frameworks including the Climate Change Act, 2016.\nThe Act designates CCD the lead agency of the government on\nnational climate change planning and action, including coordination\nof adaptation planning.\nThe CCD has the central responsibility for coordination of\nreporting on adaptation, which requires coordination with other\ninstitutions with various mandates on reporting; expertise on\ndata collection, processing and reporting; data flows; systems\nand tools for adaptation action monitoring and reporting; and\nstakeholder engagement.\n| 44 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nSector Ministries\n27 Republic of Kenya (2016).

The National Treasury, in the Ministry of Finance and Planning\nis host to the Climate Change and Green Finance unit, and plays\na key role in climate financing, including adaptation finance. The\nNational Treasury coordinates and facilitates activities related to\nclimate finance, including leading the implementation of activities\nunder the Financing Locally-led Climate Action program that has\nestablished county climate change funds in all 47 countries. The\nNational Treasury is Kenya’s Nationally Designated Authority for\nthe Green Climate Fund.27\nNational Government Sector Agencies\nThese are tasked to integrate the National Climate Change\nAction Plan into their sectoral strategies, action plans and other\nimplementation projects; and designate a unit with adequate\nstaff and financial resources to coordinate the mainstreaming\nof the NCCAP and other climate change statutory functions\nand mandates into sectoral strategies for implementation.\nFor example, the NDMA coordinates the Kenya Food Security\nSteering Group, a multi-agency team that carries out biannual\nassessments of the impacts of short and long rains on food and\nnutrition security with a view of informing drought response and\nresilience building activities including adaptation to drought risk\nacross 23 ASAL counties.28The Authority is expected to report\nannually to the National Climate Change Council through the\nClimate Change Directorate on the status and progress of climate\nchange adaptation and resilience in the ASALs.6\nCounty Governments\nAt the sub-national level, the 47 county governments are responsible\nfor operationalising climate change planning and budgeting\nwithin their jurisdictions. All counties have designated a County\nExecutive Committee member responsible for climate change\nand created a Climate Change Unit (CCU) to coordinate climate\nchange action. Many counties also have county and ward climate\nchange planning committees supporting locally-led planning\nand implementation of climate adaptation actions. The Ward\nClimate Change Planning Committees help communities to\nwork in a participatory manner to analyse their resilience to\npresent and future climate risks and use the findings to prioritise\ninvestments that the County Climate Change Funds (CCCFs) can\nsupport. County level committees help to refine the investment\nplans from Wards and support prioritization based on available\nresources; membership of the County Climate Change Planning\nCommittees is drawn from county government departments,\nnational government institutional offices in the counties (e.g.,\nKenya Meteorological Department and National Environmental\nManagement Authority); non-governmental organisations (NGOs),\ncommunity-based organisations, the private sector, and local\ncommunities.\nPrivate sector\nThe private sector continues to engage and complement government\nefforts on climate change and have been an invaluable partner for\nadaptation action. Through the NAP Readiness Support Project\n(2018 – 2020) that was funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF)\nand implemented through the Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO), the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) created the\nClimate Business Information Network-Kenya (CBIN-K) and the\nPrivate Sector Strategy on Climate Change Solutions in Kenya\n(2022-2030). 29\nPublic Benefit Organizations (NGOs, INGOs, CBOs)\nIn Kenya, the civil society is known to be a powerful agent of\nchange through public awareness creation, policy research and\nanalysis, and advocacy on key socio-economic issues including\nclimate change. They also undertake vulnerability assessments,\nbaseline studies and research; advocacy, capacity building and\nawareness creation; policy development and promotion of good\ngovernance; information sharing; gender mainstreaming in\nclimate change; monitoring and early warning systems; livelihood\nsupport; promotion of improved technologies and efficient use of\nenergy; humanitarian support; and promotion of use of indigenous\nknowledge. They play similar roles in the implementation of\nadaptation actions.7\nResearch and Academia\nThis group of actors plays a key role in building the country’s\nadaptive capacity. They help to provide the evidence for knowledgebased decision making by the national and county governments,\nprivate sector, development partners and civil society amongst\nothers. This is done through research conducted on different\naspects of climate change adaptation and resilience, including\nimproving the understanding of climate change attribution in Kenya\nand providing information on the appropriate mix of adaptation\nactions in order to avoid maladaptation.\nBiennial Transparency Report 45 |\n\nThe Media\nThe media in Kenya provides vital information at times of emergency\n— from warning of imminent floods to explaining how to deal\nwith drought emergencies and disease outbreaks. Media houses\nare actively involved in the dissemination of climate information,\nincluding progress on the implementation of adaptation activities.\nStrategic actions that improve climate change journalism can\nthemselves be forms of adaptation because accurate, timely\nand relevant information is a critical component of resilience.\nDuring the Africa Climate Change Week and Summit in Nairobi\nin 2023, the media played a great role educating the public and\ndisseminating progress and outcomes from the meeting.\n\nFigure 3.4: Climate Change Institutional Coordination Structures in Climate Change Act 2016 (Source: National Adaptation Plan, 2015)\n3.2.3.\nLegal and Policy Frameworks, Strategies and Plans\nKenya has a strong history of climate change governance beginning\nwith the enactment of the new constitution and development of\nthe National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) in 2010.\nThe policy and legal framework for adaptation includes three\nNational Climate Change Action Plans (2013 - 2017, 2018 - 2022,\n2023 - 2027), NAP (2015 - 2030), and Climate Change Act 2016.\nKenya submitted her first Nationally Determined Contribution\n(NDC) in 2016 and an updated version in 2020. The NDC responds\nto both domestic needs and international obligations under the\nUNFCCC and Paris Agreement and includes a section on adaptation\npriorities that are aligned with the NAP and NCCAPs. As stated in\nthe NCCAPs, NAP, and NDC, adaptation is the priority for Kenya.\nIn Kenya, climate change issues are given a high priority, as such\nthe Ministry of Environment and Forestry was re-designated in\nOctober 2022 to include climate change, and is now referred to\nas the Ministry of Environment Climate Change and Forestry\n(MoECCF).\n| 46 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nLaws and Policies\nTable 3.1: Summary of the key legal and policy documents related to climate adaptation\nLaw\nDescription\nThe Constitution of Kenya, 2010\nThe mother law in Kenya. Article 42 establishes Kenyans’\nright to a clean and healthy environment including the right\nto have the environment protected for the benefit of present\nand future generations. A healthy environment calls for the\nsustainable use of ecosystems and consequently continued\naccess to ecosystem goods and the services they provide\nwhich are critical for adaptation.\nClimate Change Act, 2016\nThe Climate Change Act enacted in 2016 was the first\ncomprehensive legal framework for climate change\ngovernance in Kenya with the objective of enhancing climate\nresilient development through among others promoting the\nuptake of technologies that support low carbon and climate\nresilient development; facilitating capacity development\nfor public participation in climate change responses\nthrough awareness creation, consultation, representation\nand access to information; and providing incentives and\nobligations for private sector contributions towards climate\nresilient development. Additionally, the Act provides for and\nsupports mainstreaming of climate adaptation actions into\ndevelopment planning, decision-making, and implementation.\nIt sets out principles for climate change planning and\nimplementation of measures, and recognises the\ncomplementary role of national and county governments. The\nlatter is critical considering the local nature of adaptation.

Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate\nchange in priority sectors include the policies and strategies,\ncoordination structures, planning cycles (guidelines and\ntemplates), investments, and financing. It is used for\nimplementing both the NDC and NAP and most of the actions\nare adaptation. The NCCAP was updated in 2023. Updating\nand/or revision of the NCCAP is an inclusive process involving\nboth levels of governments, private sector, research and\nacademia, communities, CSOs, media, and other actors in\nclimate adaptation.\nGuidance on Climate-related Risk Management, 2021\nThis guidance, issued by the Central Bank of Kenya, aims\nto guide institutions licensed under the Banking Act on\nclimate-related risk management. The guidance sets out\nbasic requirements for financial institutions in regard to the\nidentification, management, and reporting of climate-related\nrisks, including physical risks that result from the impacts of\nclimate- and weather-related events.\nNational Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, 2019 - 2030\nGuides strategies aimed at addressing declining biodiversity\nand related challenges. It aims to reduce the loss of\nbiodiversity, promote the value of biodiversity, and improve\ncommunity livelihoods. Highlighted adaptation interventions\ninclude conservation of agricultural biodiversity through\nincreased support to local communities in the production and\nsustainable utilisation of indigenous and/or traditional species\nfor food and other uses; strengthening institutional and\ncommunity capacity and linkages; promotion of gender equity\nin biodiversity management; and supporting and promoting\nthe utilisation of indigenous knowledge, innovations, and\npractices among others.\nKenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Implementation\nFramework, 2018 - 2027\nProvides guidelines for the implementation of the CSA\nstrategy at national and county levels in support of food\nsecurity and economic development. The national government\nis largely expected to lead on policy development and\nsupport capacity building, while county governments lead on\nimplementation since agriculture is a devolved function.\nKenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Strategy, 2017 - 2026\nAims to improve productivity and build the resilience of\nagricultural systems while minimising greenhouse gas\nemissions. Recognises the high vulnerability of the agriculture\nsector and identifies priority interventions for building\nresilience of the sector through the implementation of Climate\nSmart Agriculture (CSA) practices in the crop, livestock, and\nfisheries sectors in support of food and nutrition security and\npoverty reduction.\nBiennial Transparency Report 49 |\n\nStrategy/Plan\nDescription\nClimate Risk Management Framework, 2017\nThe framework bridges climate change adaptation, disaster\nrisk management, and sustainable development at national\nand county levels. The framework ensures that the three\ndistinct entities are pursued as mutually supportive rather\nthan stand-alone goals and that an integrated approach to\nclimate risk management becomes a key component of\npolicy and strategy for resilience building. The adaptation\nactions under this framework include analysing exposure and\nvulnerability to disasters, and capacity to respond; mobilising\nfinancial resources for climate risk management; designing\nand implementing pilot projects for climate risk management\nat county and national levels; enhancing research and\ndissemination of information about climate risk management;\nand building capacity at national and county levels for\nintegrated climate risk management.\nNational Adaptation Plan 2015 - 2030\nThe long-term plan aims at consolidating the country’s vision\non adaptation by supporting macro-level adaptation actions\nthat are aligned with the economic sectors and addressing\ncounty-level vulnerabilities to enhance long-term resilience\nand adaptive capacity. It is implemented through the fiveyear NCCAPs. The NAP highlights climate vulnerabilities\nand priority areas for building climate resilience. It presents\nadaptation actions that cover the time frame 2015 - 2030 and\nbuilds on the foundation laid by the National Climate Change\nResponse Strategy (NCCRS) and the NCCAP 2013-2017.\nFurthermore, it is the basis for the adaptation component of\nKenya’s NDC.\nNational Climate Change Response Strategy, 2010\nThe NCCRS formally recognised the need for coordinated\nefforts in addressing climate change issues in Kenya. It\nrecommended the development of a climate change policy\nand legislation on which adaptation activities were to be\nanchored. Consequently, a stand-alone climate change act\nand related governance structures and plans (e.g., NCCAP and\nNAP) were developed and supported coordinated adaptation\naction. Some of the priority adaptation actions highlighted in\nthe climate change response strategy included: promoting\norphan crops; agricultural produce post-harvest processing,\nstorage, and value addition; breeding of animals from various\nagro-ecological zones that adapt well to climatic variances;\nproviding special livestock insurance; establishing a national\nclimate awareness campaign; and incorporating climate\nchange in the school curriculum within Information and\nawareness building.\n3.2.4.\nSub-national Level Legal Frameworks, Policies and Strategies8\n30 Government of Kenya. (2024).\nThe Climate Change Act, 2016 requires county governments to\nintegrate climate change actions into their plans and policies.\nCounty governments have progressively been incorporating climate\nchange initiatives into their plans and programmes as mandated,\nmaking use of the five- year County Integrated Development Plan\n(CIDP) process as the main instruments to mainstream climate\nchange actions in development planning. Typically, the CIDPs\nintegrate adaptation actions alongside mitigation and other types\nof climate resilience interventions including enabling actions like\nclimate finance, which is now legally mandated in all 47 counties\nthrough climate change-specific policies and legislation.30\nSome counties have also developed strategies and regulations\nto operationalise climate-related legislation. The County Climate\nChange Fund (CCCF) mechanism that aims to enhance access\nand channel climate finance to the community level is now\nestablished and operational in the 47 counties in Kenya. Through\nthis mechanism, each county government sets aside a minimum\nof 1.5% of their development budgets for climate actions,\nallocated through the respective County Climate Change Fund. In\naddition, County Climate Change Action Plans are mainstreamed\ninto the County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) that are\nimplemented over five years through the Annual Development\n| 50 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nPlans (ADPs). Many counties have climate change governance\nstructures down to the ward level which is the lowest administrative\nand planning unit. Local communities are facilitated to identify\nand prioritise mostly climate adaptation interventions through\n31 Nying’uro et al. (2024).\n32 Trisos, C.H. et al. (2022).

This is achieved with the support of the climate change\nplanning committees at the county and ward levels, making use\nof relevant resilience planning tools and climate information.\nCase study: CCCF Mechanism as a strategy for adaptation\nThe integration of climate information into planning and\nimplementation has been supported through county-specific\nClimate Information Services (CIS) plans prepared by the Kenya\nMeteorological Department (KMD), working with other partners.\nThese CIS plans support effective, locally-led adaptation because\nthey are based on local needs and contribute to improved access\nand use of climate information at institutional and household\nlevels. Designated agencies for disaster management also make\nuse of climate information services at the sub-national level for\npreparedness and response. For example, the NDMA currently\nsupports the 23 ASAL counties with Drought Early Warnings that\nare issued monthly to aid drought preparedness and early action.\nThe CCCF mechanism was initially piloted and operationalized\nin rural counties; however, the more complex urban contexts\nwith projected exponential population growth required a tailored\napproach. Through urban policy and legislation, Kenya has 5\ncities and over 70 municipalities with governance structures\nthat support integration of local climate actions including the\nmainstreaming of climate-resilient development pathways in the\nprovision of necessary urban infrastructure and services. Nairobi\nand Mombasa cities have just set up their CCCF mechanisms\nwith support from FLLoCA programme.\n3.2.5.\nCapacity-building and Capacity Gaps and Needs\nCapacity building is concerned with enhancing the ability of\ninstitutions and communities to effectively carry out climate\nadaptation actions. Institutional and technical capacity development\nis critical in the delivery of proposed adaptation actions as prioritized\nin national planning documents and country plans. The Climate\nChange Act 2016 established a number of institutions and set\nmandates for existing institutions in regard to climate action in\nKenya. Significant progress has been made on operationalisation\nand strengthening of the institutional structures set out in the\nClimate Change Act (Amendment, 2023), including the National\nClimate Change Council, CCD, National Environment Management\nAuthority (NEMA), Climate Change Fund, Kenya Institute of\nCurriculum Development (KICD), Kenya School of Government\n(KSG), Council of Governors (CoG), and Climate Change Units\nboth at national and county level. It is notable that to more\neffectively support climate action, including climate adaptation,\nthe National Climate Change Fund became operational in 2022\nand is managed by the National Treasury. Climate Change Units\nat both national and county government levels also have focal\npoints, officers leading and coordinating on climate action. Gaps\nand needs on capacity building are further discussed in section\n3.5.3 (3) on capacity needs. 9\nClimate Change Hazards, vulnerabilities and impacts in Kenya\nThis section includes a summary of key climate hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks and impacts on different sectors\nof the economy. The information in this section draws on Kenya’s Adaptation Communication (2024 draft), as\nwell as county level Participatory Climate Risk Assessments facilitated through the Financing Locally-Led Climate\nAction (FLLoCA) program under the National Treasury & Economic Planning.\n3.2.6.\nClimate Hazards\nAnalysis in the Kenya National Adaptation Plan (2015 – 2030) and\nthe National Climate Change Action Plans demonstrates that Kenya\nis exposed to climate hazards and details the actual biophysical\nevents that are driven by climate change. It is estimated that over\n70% of natural disasters in Kenya are attributable to extreme\nclimatic events – particularly flooding and droughts. Evidence\nshows that climate change increased the intensity of rainfall in\nthe short rainy season in the Horn of Africa in 2023, leading to\nsevere flash flooding in the eastern region which caused more\nthan 300 deaths and displaced over a million people.31Studies\nhave not reached consensus on whether droughts have been\nincreasing or decreasing overall in East Africa since the 1950s;\nhowever, research indicates that since 2005, droughts have\ndoubled in frequency from once every six years to once every three\nyears in the region.32 Typically, major droughts occur in cycles of\napproximately ten years, and moderate droughts or floods have\nbecome common every three to four years. Apart from eroding the\ncapacity to adapt, the repeating cycles of flooding and droughts\nhave socio-economic impacts and high economic costs.\nFor example, the 1998 to 2000 drought cost an estimated US$2.8\nbillion, principally due to crops and livestock loss, as well as forest\nfires, damage to fisheries, reduced hydropower generation, reduced\nindustrial production and reduced water supplies.33 Another\nsevere and prolonged drought from 2008–2011 affected 3.7\nmillion people, caused US$12.1 billion in damages and losses,\nand cost over US$1.7 billion in recovery and reconstruction needs.\n34 Figure 3.5 below demonstrates the number of people affected\nby key natural hazards between 1980 and 2020.\nBiennial Transparency Report 51 |\n\nFigure 3.5: Key Natural Hazard Statistics for 1980 – 2020 (Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)\nMajor climate hazards in Kenya are categorised into two groups: acute climate hazards and chronic or slow onset hazards.

Average rainfall is expected to increase by midcentury, particularly during the ‘short rains’, which occur between\nOctober and December.37 Increased aridity and drought have been\nobserved, with extreme rainfall events occurring with greater\nfrequency and intensity. Extreme events from 2018 to 2024 in\nKenya included flash floods, floods, landslides, and rising lake\nlevels.38 A climate change vulnerability assessment in the Upper\nEwaso Nyiro basin (an ASAL ecosystem) showed that there has\nbeen high climate variability over 30 years especially within the\nlong rains in March, April, and May. 39\nc) Sea Level Rise and Temperature Increase\nKenya is experiencing sea level rise, and the rate of sea level rise\nalong the Western Indian Ocean is estimated to be 4.0mm/year\ncompared to the global average of 3.4mm/year.40 Sea levels are\nexpected to continue to rise along Kenya’s coast (Figure 3.7\nillustrates the expected increase under Representative Concentration\nPathway (RCP) 4.5, which is the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change’s moderate scenario in which greenhouse gas\nemissions peak around 2040 and then decline). Increasing sea\nsurface temperatures, marine heatwaves, and ocean acidification\nalongside rising sea levels and stronger storm surges impact marine\nlife, lead to coastal erosion, and increase the risk of flooding in\nthe five coastal counties (Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, and\nLamu). Global projections of 21–48 cm of sea level rise by the\nend of the 21st century compared with the 1980–1999 average\ncould be devastating for Kenya.41 A 30 cm increase in sea level\nrise could submerge 17% of the city of Mombasa, Kenya’s second\nlargest city and the largest seaport in East Africa.42\n\nFigure 3.7: Projected Sea level rise along the Kenyan coast between 2008–2098 (RCP 4.5) (World Bank, 2024)\n3.2.7.\nClimate Change Vulnerability\nThis section discusses Kenya’s exposure, sensitivity and overall\nvulnerability to climate change and how it affects climate\nadaptation. The IPCC defines vulnerability as “the propensity or\npredisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety\nof concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility\nto harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.”43The IPCC\nframework demonstrates that climate risks are the product of the\ninteraction between climate hazards, vulnerability and exposure\nof the relevant systems, sectors or populations.\nKenya ranked 135th out of 187 countries in 2022 according to the\nNotre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) index, which\nranks countries on their level of vulnerability to climate change\nand readiness to implement adaptation solutions 44(See figure\n3.8). it was the 135th most vulnerable country and the 146th most\nready country – implying that it is very vulnerable to, yet unready\nto combat the impacts of climate change.45\nFigure 3.8: ND-GAIN Index for Kenya: Vulnerability Dimension (World Bank, 2024)11\nBiennial Transparency Report 53 |\n\nThe summary in table 3.4 demonstrates that the high levels of\nclimate vulnerability in Kenya are attributable to a number of\nkey factors: a low-lying coastline; heavy dependence on rainfed\nagriculture; water scarcity; insecure land tenure; environmental\ndegradation; and conflicts over natural resources like water and\npasture during the very dry seasons.46 Apart from low-lying coastal\nregions that are very exposed to sea level rise, communities and\nsystems in the ASALs, which constitute up to 89% of the land\narea and 38% of the country’s total population,47 are particularly\nvulnerable to climate change because of high levels of poverty\nwhich limit their adaptive capacity and increase their exposure\nto recurring droughts. Crop and livestock production in the\nASALS are impacted by droughts and flash flooding. The most\naffected counties with above-normal livestock mortality rates\n(5%) in 2023 were ASALs and included Marsabit, Kajiado, Isiolo,\nSamburu, Turkana, Wajir, and Mandera.

Over 51% of the urban population in Kenya\nin 2020 was considered poor and living in unplanned informal\nsettlements without basic infrastructure and services, which\nincreases their vulnerability for climate risks.50 Inadequate\nplanning, environmental management, and enforcement often\ncontributes to flash flooding in informal settlements that occupy\nlow lying riverine areas and floodplains.12\nTable 3.4: Summary of the key sources of vulnerability in Kenya and identifies the most vulnerable groups\nClimate Change Vulnerability\nKey Sources of Vulnerability\n\t• Poverty, with 7.1% of the population considered poor in 2022\n(living on less than USD 1.90 per day); with high levels of\nmulti-dimensional poverty in the ASALs 51\n\t• Significant disparities between rural and urban areas, poverty\nrates in rural areas were 6.5 times higher than urban areas in\n2022\n\t• Population growth, with 75% of the population under the age\nof 35 in 2019\n\t• Gender inequality\n\t• High reliance of the national economy and local livelihoods on\nnatural resources\n\t• High dependence on rainfed agriculture and insufficient\nirrigation systems; 98% of agriculture production is rainfed\n\t• Water scarcity and mismanagement of water resources\n\t• Environmental degradation, including loss of forest cover\n\t• Pastoral mobility\n\t• Insecure land tenure and land fragmentation\n\t• Migration to urban areas\n\t• Poor urban and land-use planning; rapid and haphazard\nurbanisation\n\t• Large number of informal settlements due to rural–urban\nmigration\n\t• Limited access to quality healthcare, particularly in rural areas\n\t• Inadequate access to improved technologies\n\t• Inadequate finance to address climate change priorities\nParticularly Vulnerable Groups\n\t• Pastoralist communities, hunters and gatherers, and fisher\ncommunities\n\t• Women\n\t• Children/Youth\n\t• Persons with disabilities\n\t• Elderly\n\t• People with small landholdings and/or livelihoods\ndependent on natural resources\n\t• People living in informal settlements\nParticularly Vulnerable Regions\n\t• Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs)\n\t• Flood prone areas including low-lying coastal regions,\nfloodplain and riverine areas like the Tana Delta, Kano\nPlains and Budalang’i\n\t• Informal urban settlements in low lying riverine areas and\nfloodplains\n\t• Mountainous regions\n| 54 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n3.2.8.\nClimate Change Risks and Impacts in Kenya\nThe LTLED Strategy (2017 – 2022) indicated that adaptation actions\nhave the potential to reduce this loss by about one third over the\nsame period highlighting the need to implement priority actions.\nTable 3.5 below includes information on key climate risks and\nimpacts based on NCCAP III priority areas.\nTable 3.5: Key Climate Risks and Impacts in Kenya\nBiennial Transparency Report 55 |\n\nSector\nRisks\nImpacts\nDisaster Risk\nManagement\nSevere\ndrought\n\t• Droughts cause decline in water levels affecting agricultural activities, livestock keeping,\nand in the worst cases causing loss of lives.\n\t• Droughts contributed to conflicts, deteriorating health conditions, and forced\ndisplacement in large parts of the ASALs.\nHeavy rainfall\nand flooding13\n\t• Flooding causes deaths, displacement of populations, property destruction, and\ndisruption of agriculture and livelihoods. Floods in 2023 affected 38 counties across\nKenya, resulting in loss of lives, injuries, displacements, and destruction of key\ninfrastructure. An increase in contaminated water also led to secondary effects, including\nvector and waterborne disease outbreaks. 757,173 people (138,560 households) were\naffected since the onset of the short rains season between October and December\n2023.52\n\t• In March 2023, heavy rains led to widespread flooding across several counties, including\nMombasa, Kwale, Tana River, and others. These floods resulted in 36 fatalities and left 29\npeople injured, affecting a total of 139,135 individuals.

It has been estimated that between 1995 and 2019, the percentage\nof Kenyans living under water-stressed conditions increased from 14.8% to 33.2%, partly\nattributed to climate change impacts.61\n\t• Climate change impacts on water resources have affected agriculture through loss\nof crops, human health through water-borne diseases associated with flooding and\ndestruction of key related infrastructure.\n\t• Increase in water demand from population growth and an expanding economy\ncompounds the water availability challenges presented by climate change.62For example,\nduring long dry spells like in 2018, many urban areas faced acute water shortages due to\nlow water levels in rivers.\n\t• Changes in rainfall have increased water levels63in Kenyan lakes. The increase in the\narea of lakes in the Great Rift Valley, ranging from a 21% increase for Lake Naivasha to a\n123% increase for Lake Solai, leadinghas contributed to changes in flora and fauna and\naffectingaffected local communities that rely on these natural aquatic resources.64\n\t• Sea level rise is a risk to the five coastal counties and their populations; an estimated\n267,000 Kenyans will be at risk of coastal flooding by 2030 due to sea level rise.\n\t• Climate change is also causing storms and rougher seas, which prevents fisher\ncommunities from earning a living and obtaining fish for sustenance, especially in the\nmonths of May, June, and July.\n\t• Sea level rise is projected to increase the levels of salinity in coastal freshwater aquifers,\nwhich would exacerbate the current water supply issues.\n\t• Crop production may be hampered by salt stress brought on by the waterlogging of the\nsoils. Additionally, because saline water intrusion impacts coastal ecosystems, the health\nof coastal inhabitants is at stake.65\n\t• Sea level rise is a risk to the five coastal counties and their populations; an estimated\n267,000 Kenyans will be at risk of coastal flooding by 2030 due to sea level rise.\n\t• Sea level rise is projected to increase the levels of salinity in coastal freshwater aquifers,\nwhich would exacerbate the current water supply issues.\nForestry,\nWildlife and\nTourism\nRising\ntemperatures\nand changing\nprecipitation\npatterns;\nprolonged\ndroughts and\nflooding\n\t• Forest degradation, damage and transformation of forest areas, and changes in species\ncomposition.\n\t• Prolonged droughts weaken forests, making them more susceptible to pests, diseases,\nand forest fires, further contributing to their degradation. Wildfires are particularly\ncommon during dry seasons and destroy large forests areas whenever they occur.\n\t• Rainfall variability and prolonged drought are already altering wildlife migrations, affecting\ntourist visits on big nature reserves such as the Maasai Mara.66\nEcosystems and\nBiodiversity\nRising\ntemperatures\nincluding\nwarmer\nnights,\nchanging\nprecipitation\npatterns;\nprolonged\ndroughts,\nflooding14\n\t• Ecosystems and critical ecosystem services in Kenya are deteriorating in quality and\nquantity. This affects the provision of water, food and timber; air purification; carbon\nsequestration; flood control; soil and habitats; and cultural, spiritual and recreational\nservices.\n\t• Climate change facilitates the spread and establishment of many Invasive Alien Species\n(IAS) and creates new opportunities for them to become invasive with devastating\nimpacts on the native species and biodiversity.67\n\t• Projections indicate that species richness along the Tana River basin – an economically\nimportant and ecologically diverse region – is projected to reduce significantly with just\n2°C of global temperature rise with plants and birds most affected. And the impacts\nworsen with further warming. While 82% of the basin can offer protection for the majority\nof plant species with 1.5°C of warming, this figure reduces to 23% with 2°C of warming\nand to just 3% with 4.5°C of warming.68\n\t• There will be a substantial climate-driven shift in vegetation towards more shrubland\n(normally associated with arid lands) at the expense of savannahs, grasslands and\nforests. Consequently, protected areas in Kenya could lose between 16% and 50% of their\nforests, depending on future emissions.69\n61 Nying’uro et al. , (2024)\n62 GoK. (2020). Updated NDC\n63 GoK. (2020).

For example, as of 2nd October 2023, a total\nof twelve thousand, one hundred and twenty-three (12,123) vector-borne disease cases,\nwith six hundred and twenty-seven (627) confirmed by culture, and two hundred and two\n(202) deaths were reported (Ministry of Health, 2023).70\n\t• Higher temperatures are projected to increase heat-related deaths especially among the\nelderly and contribute to extending the risk of malaria to new areas. Approximately 13 to\n20 million Kenyans are at risk of malaria, and vulnerable populations especially pregnant\nwomen, children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions are particularly\nat risk.\n\t• Weather-related deaths are a particular public health concern in informal settlements,\nwith research finding an increase in child mortality and in deaths from noncommunicable illnesses, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, with\nincreasing temperature.\n\t• Climate change has been identified as a factor contributing to the increased burden of\nzoonotic diseases in Kenya, such as Brucellosis, Anthrax and Rift Valley fever.71\n\t• Shifting climatic patterns and extreme weather events – such as more frequent and\nheavier rain events, water encroachment, over abstraction of groundwater, storm\nsurges in coastal areas – damage and increase the risk of collapse of buildings and\ninfrastructure.72\n\t• The impact on housing – in terms of its construction, cost, and longevity – is devastating\nin Kenya, where prolongedProlonged drought has negatively impacted the supply of\nbuilding materials such as timber, while also reducing water levels, which then impacts\nthe cost of electricity.73\nManufacturing\nDeclining\nwater\navailability\ndue to\nchanging\nprecipitation\npatterns and\ndroughts15\n\t• In Agroagro-processing, the 2011 and 2017 droughts affected tea production across the\ncountry and resulted in diminished turnover in processed tea. Generally, teaTea producers\nmay lose up to 30 percent% of their cash earnings due to climate variability, particularly\ndrought.74\n\t• Manufacturing, including among small enterprises that are important for vulnerable\nhouseholds, is negatively affected by electric power instability as droughts lower water\nlevels in the hydroelectric dams.\n\t• ManufacturingThe manufacturing sector’s input supply comes from sectors like\nagriculture, forestry, or fisheries that are also vulnerable to climate risk; for example,\ndecelerated growth in the manufacturing sector in 2022 (2.7% down from 7.3% in 2021)\nwas partly attributed to low agricultural production due to drought, notably of food crops,\nwhich are the primary inputs for agro-processing. 75\ne0254879 (2021).\n69 Nying’uro et al. , (2024)\n70 Egondi, T. et al.

For example, the heavy rainfall experienced throughout the year\n2023 resulted in destruction of roads across different parts of the country. Several roads\nwere cut off by flash floods in Tana River, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera.76\n\t• The Kenya Highways Authority participated in a vulnerability assessment of the Horn of\nAfrica Gateway project, a large road infrastructure project, that found projected increased\nrainfall is expected to increase the risk of flooding, erosion, washouts, and siltation, and\nto aggravate connectivity problems.77\n\t• Climate-related weather extremes also impact the design, construction, location, and\noperation of electricity generation and transmission infrastructure. For example, a\nvulnerability assessment of hydroelectric energy resources impacted by climate change\nin the Seven Forks project found that the catchment temperature is rising by 0.02°C\nannually while the rains are declining by 3.9 mm annually.\n\t• The rapid decline of Mount Kenya’s glaciers is affecting hydropower generation, which is\ncurrently extremely reliant on the Mount Kenya region, with the Tana River contributing\naround 70% of Kenya’s total hydropower generation.78\n\t• Masinga dam, one of the main Seven Forks reservoirs for hydroelectric power production\nalong the Tana River, faces inflow drop of 0.74 cubic metres of water per second annually,\nleading to an average power output below capacity by up to 16-Gigawatt hours annually.79\n3.3.\tNational adaptation priorities and barriers\n3.3.1.\nPriorities for Adaptation in Kenya\n76 KMD.

The Climate Finance and Green Economy Unit at the\nNational Treasury and Planning is responsible for coordinating\nclimate finance mobilization and reporting in the country.\nCountry-driven strategies\nKenya’s country driven approach is embedded within Kenya’s\nclimate change legal and policy frameworks that set national\nclimate change priorities identified through sectoral needs’\nassessments and stakeholder consultation processes. The\nframeworks designate sector level actions that require support\nand form the basis for to address climate change.\nThe country recognizes the importance of developing needsresponsive interventions that enhance adaptive capacities,\nbuild resilience to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions. In principle, all climate actions must be country\ndriven, and country owned, developed in a manner that is in line\nwith national climate plans and priorities in consultation with\nnational and county governments’ institutional structures, and\nstakeholders.\nKenya underscores the crucial importance of means of\nimplementation in driving successful implementation of climate\naction in line with national commitments. The country explores and\nadopts technologies as well as requisite capacity strengthening\nefforts to facilitate effective delivery of impactful actions. Examples\nof these technologies include drought-resistant crops and renewable\nenergy solutions, access to which is facilitated by collaboration\nwith international partners. There are still technological gaps\nacross sectors and a need for further technology transfer to\nenable the full implementation of the NDC and a just transition\nKenya also undertakes capacity–building efforts which are equally\ncrucial for climate action. Training programs, technical assistance,\nand community engagement initiatives are designed to enhance\nthe adaptive capacity of local institutions and communities. These\nefforts ensure that climate actions are sustainable and locally\ndriven. However, capacity building initiatives often struggle with\ninadequate funding, lack of infrastructure, insufficient human\nresources and inadequately address institutional capacity gaps.\nFinancial resources are critical to Kenya’s adaptation and mitigation\nstrategies. The country has made significant strides in mobilizing\nclimate finance from both domestic and international sources.\nHowever, there remains a huge gap between finance needed\nand what is availed. This gap leads to delays and comprises the\neffectiveness of efforts to address climate change. Additionally,\nKenya....\n6.2.\tUnderlying assumptions, definitions and methodologies\nIn determining support received, Kenya makes the following:\nAssumptions\n1.\nOn-budget and off-budget support was considered in this\nBTR, acknowledging existing limitations in off-budget\nsupport tracking and data compilation that require more\ncomplex and detailed tracking practices to be developed over\ntime. On-budget support refers to financial support received\ndirectly into Kenya’s budget from international sources.\nOff-budget refers to financial and in-kind (technological\nand technical assistance) resources received by the\ngovernment through non-governmental channels or offered\ndirectly to government agencies without direct financial\ninput to the national budget.\n2.\nFollowing the explanation above, we assume that Kenya\nreceived the full sum of indicated amounts within the\nJanuary 2021 to December 2022 period into the national\nbudget.\nDefinitions and methodologies\n3.\nOnly core climate change support is considered as support\nreceived. In this BTR, Kenya considers support received\nfrom projects whose main(core) objective is climate change\nmitigation and adaptation that are designated under the\nNDC. Development projects with climate benefits have\nnot been considered due to challenges in determining\nadditionality.\n4.\nThe BTR report only considers finance received and\nexpended (used) in contributing to the objectives of the NDC.\n5.\nIn principle, concessional loans received to support core\nclimate change projects shall count as Kenya’s climate\nfinance contribution. Kenya does not count market-rate\nloans (commercial loans) as climate finance.\n6.\nFinancial resources from the ex-chequer (internal budgetary\nallocation) are counted as Kenya’s own contribution.\n7.\nTo avoid double counting, this report has not considered\ninformation on support provided to Kenya based on the\nOECD/DAC data. This data will, however, be considered in\nfuture reports after Kenya develops an elaborate tracking\nsystem for climate finance.\n8.\nInformation on non-monetized climate support received\nhas not been included in the report. This is due to a lack\nof adequate information and data.\n40 Biennial Update Report\n\n6.3.\tInformation on financial support needed\nKenya conducted a technical analysis of the resources required to\nmeet the country’s NDCs’ targets. The technical analysis evaluated\nthe national and sectoral policies, plans, and strategies including\nidentified priority actions to inform data driven decisions based\non evidence and analytics. To complement the technical analysis,\ndata from available sectoral reports was assessed allowing for\nthe extraction of meaningful insights to better understand Kenya’s\npriorities in scaling up climate action in meeting our NDC targets.\nThe NDC targets cut across different sectors including disaster risk\nreduction, agriculture (crops, livestock, and fisheries), environment,\ngender, youth, and other vulnerable groups, as well as devolution.\nOverall, Kenya requires USD 62 billion until 2030 to support\nimplementation of NDC targets. Of this amount, mitigation\nactions for the period 2020-2030 require an estimated total of USD\n17,725 million with designated sectoral financial totals as follows:\nEnergy USD 8,890 million, Agriculture 250 million, Transport and\ninfrastructure USD 4,240 million, LULUCF USD 4126 million, and\nwaste USD 39 million. Of the total mitigation finance needed,\nKenya intends to shoulder 21% (3,725 million USD) from domestic\nsources subject to national circumstances, while the balance\nof USD 14,000 million (79%) is to be covered by international\nsupport. Adaptation remains a key priority for Kenya. To meet\nits adaptation costs for the period 2020-2030, Kenya requires an\nestimated USD 43,927 million. Subject to national circumstances,\nKenya intends to mobilize domestic resources to cater for 10%\nof the adaptation cost, while 90% of the adaptation cost, will\nrequire international support in the form of finance, technology\ndevelopment and transfer, and capacity building\n6.4.\tInformation on financial support received\nKenya has received a total of USD 507 Million in this BTR period.\nThis constitutes both on-budget and off-budget support. The onbudget support accounts for 89% of the total sum which is USD\n456 Million. USD 52 Million was delivered as grants, USD 365\nmillion was in loans. In line with Kenya’s NDC definition of climate\nfinance, the USD 365 million received as loans (both concessional\nand commercial) shall be counted towards Kenya’s contribution\nonce repayments are made. Off-budget support amounted to USD\n51 Million. This amount is not representative of the full support\nreceived during this period due to limitations in tracking various\nbilateral initiatives in Kenya. Kenya acknowledges the need to\ndesign and strengthen off-budget tracking mechanisms, and\nthe importance of international support towards this objective\nwithin the scope of availing support for reporting and building\nMonitoring, Reporting and Verification systems.\n6.5.\tInformation on technology development and transfer\nsupport needed by developing country Parties under Article\n10 of the Paris Agreement\nKenya’s technology development and transfer support needed is\nincluded in sectoral costs indicated in section 4.3 as estimated\nfinance needed to support technology development, and adoption.\nHowever, the methodology does not distinctly separate specific\nsupport needed for various technologies from the earmarked\npriority actions. Therefore, this BTR does not include specific\nfinance needed for technology development and transfer.\nKenya considers the development of a Technology Action Plan\nas an important intervention to assess the technological costs\nof various technologies identified in the NDC.\n6.6.\tInformation on capacity-building support needed\nThe support required for capacity-building initiatives during this\nBTR period is included in the total support needed (USD 62 billion)\nas outlined in section 4.3. Specific costing of capacity building\nneeds across each NDC target sector was not available.\n6.7.\tInformation on capacity-building support received\nKenya has received a total of USD 5.6 million towards capacitybuilding initiatives in this BTR period which was majorly from the\nGCF Readiness support. A total of USD 4.5 million was delivered\nas grants/technical assistance.\n6.8.\tInformation on support received for the preparation of\nthe BUR\nThe Global Environment Facility (GEF) funding under the Enabling\nActivities was Kenya’s only direct funding to prepare the initial\nBUR. Following the approval of the BUR1 project proposal, Kenya\nreceived funding support of $352,000 through the UN Environment\nas the implementing agency. The GEF funding enabled Kenya to\ncompile the initial BUR. Due to internal administrative challenges\nthat affected the disbursement of project funds from UNEP, the\nGEF implementing entity supporting Kenya, Kenya could not receive\nthe required resources within time to prepare the reports. The\ncontributions from the Transparency Accelerator Initiative, GIZ,\nNAP-Global, CIAT, Fauna & Flora and CBIT-GSP through technical\nassistance contributed to compiling the NC3 and BTR1.\nBiennial Update Report 41\n\nAnnex\nAnnex 1: National GHG Inventory Document.\n42 Biennial Update Report\n\nw w w . e n v i r o n m e n t . g o . k e",

Kenya’s Adaptation Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Forestry, Nairobi, Kenya.\nKenya is a signatory to both the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement\nthat it adopted in 2015. The country recognizes the challenge\nassociated with addressing the causes and impacts of climate\nchange globally and locally. As such, Kenya through its Nationally\nDetermined Contributions on adaptation (NDC) is committed to\ntaking action to contribute to the implementation of the Global\nGoal on Adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening\nresilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change. This\nchapter aims to communicate the country’s progress towards all\nsubstantive aspects of the Paris Agreement regarding adaptation\n(under Article 7) and loss and damage (under Article 8).\nPreparation of this chapter was guided by Decision 18/CMA.1\nchapter IV of the UNFCCC as well as Kenya’s National Adaptation\nPlan 2015-2030 (NAP) whose vision is “enhanced climate resilience\ntowards vision 2030”.4 The communication in this chapter builds\non Kenya’s updated NDC, 2020 and draws on the recent adaptation\ntechnical analysis report (ATAR) for the National Climate Change\nAction Plan (NCCAP) III 2023-2027, NCCAP progress reports,\nand Kenya’s draft Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC.5\nThis chapter provides information on Kenya’s national context,\nrisk and vulnerability profile; national adaptation priorities and\nbarriers; adaptation strategies, policies, goals and plans to integrate\nadaptation into Kenya’s Climate Action; implementation progress,\nresults evaluation and learning; and averting, minimizing and\naddressing loss and damage associated with climate change\nimpacts.\n27\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n3.2.

It borders South Sudan, Ethiopia,\nand Somalia to the north; Uganda to the west; Tanzania to the\nsouth; and the Indian Ocean to the east. The total land area is\n569,137 square kilometres. Mount Kenya is the highest point\nin Kenya at 5,199 metres above sea level and the lowest point\nis at sea level on the Indian Ocean. The country is situated\nwithin the Greater Horn of Africa which is a generally dry region\ncharacterised by frequent droughts that are punctuated by heavy\nrainfall events that often result in flash floods. (GoK, 2024a).\nDemographic Profile\n The Kenya National Bureau of Statistic’s 2019 Kenya Population\nand Housing Census determined that the country’s population\nwas 47,564,296 persons, with 23,548,100 males and 24,014,700\nfemales. The urban population was about 28 percent. The census\ndetermined that Kenya had a population density of 82 persons\nper km2. In 2019, Kenya youths under the age of 35 years made\nup 75 percent of the population and were comprised of children\n(0-14 years) - 18,541,982 (39.0 percent), adolescents (10-19\nyears) - 11,631,929 (24.5 percent), and youths (18-34 years) -\n13,777,600 (29.0 percent). The elderly population (65+ years)\nwas 1,870,493 persons (3.9 percent). The working age population\n(15-64 years) was 27,151,134 (57.1 percent) persons in 2019.6\nWeather and Climate\nKenya is made up of seven agro-ecological zones which experience\nvarying climates and weather patterns.7 The arid regions of the\ncountry receive annual average rainfall of between 200 and\n500 mm and annual temperatures range from 23°C to 34°C.\nThe semi-arid areas experience an average annual rainfall of\n600 to 1,000 mm and are slightly cooler in temperature. The\narid and semi-arid lands are characterized by low and erratic\nrainfall, strong winds and intense sunlight for most of the year.8\nThe coastal climatic zone, a band approximately 16 kilometres\nwide, is humid all year round with an average annual temperature\nrange of 22°C to 30°C and an average rainfall of between 1,000\nand 1,250 mm. The most temperate zones are the Central and\nWestern highlands and parts of the central Rift Valley with annual\nrainfall levels averaging between 950 and 3,000 mm and average\nannual temperatures ranging between 14°C to 28°C.\nKenya Meteorological Department (KMD) data indicates that\nKenya’s temperatures vary, with the highlands experiencing\nconsiderably cooler temperatures than the coastal and lowland\nregions. The months of June to August are characterised by\ncooler temperatures while the highest temperatures are typically\nexperienced during the month of March. Kenya’s annual rainfall\nfollows a bimodal seasonal pattern, commonly referred to as\nthe “long rains” season occurring in March, April, and May, and\nthe “short rains” season, occurring in October, November, and\nDecember. Another season takes place from June to August\nover the coastal region and the Highlands West of the Rift Valley.\nAverage annual precipitation in Kenya is typically 680 mm,\nranging from less than 250 mm in parts of the northern arid\nand semi-arid land (ASAL) areas to about 2,000 mm in the high\nrainfall zone in the Western region, that includes the country’s\nproductive agricultural land.9\n28\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n10 Rathore, V.

Communities with high levels of climate vulnerability\nare particularly impacted by sequential climate events; where\na subsequent climate hazard (i.e., extreme rainfall) impacts the\nsocio-ecological system before full recovery from the previous\nhazard (i.e., drought). Compound drought-extreme rainfall events\nare occurring with greater frequency and intensity, reducing the\navailable recovery time and eroding the capacity for resilience.\nFigure 3-3: Observed Annual Precipitation of Kenya for 1901 -2022(Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)\nEconomic Profile\nKenya is a lower-middle-income economy and among the\nfastest-growing economies in Africa. Kenya’s gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) was USD 115.08 billion and GDP per capita was\nUSD 2,220 in October 2024.15 The World Bank reported that\nKenya’s GDP increased by 4.8 percent in 2022 and 5.4 percent\nin 2023; but is expected to slow down to 5.0 percent in 2024.\nThe poverty rate ($2.15 international poverty rate) is projected\nto decline from 35.1 percent in 2023 to 34.3 percent in 2024.\nKenya has a favourable medium-term economic outlook with\nprojected GDP growth of 5.2 percent for 2024-2026, although\nthe economy is susceptible to climate-related risks, such as\nextreme weather conditions.16\nThe agricultural sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting\nfor approximately 20% of Kenya’s GDP.17 The country’s highlands\nhost significant farmlands as well as the majority of the population.\nThe highlands are relatively cool and agriculturally rich, and\nare largely dominated by commercial and small-holder farms.\nPrincipal cash crops include tea, coffee, flowers, vegetables,\npyrethrum. Wheat and maize, as well as livestock production\nis also practiced across the highlands, which lie at 1,500 m to\n3,000 m above sea level.18 It largely remains rainfed making it\nvulnerable to the changing climate.\nThe service and industry sectors are also major economic\ndrivers, particularly tourism and manufacturing. There is rapid\nurbanisation with projections showing that over 50 percent\nof the population will live in urban areas by 2030.19 Kenya is a\nmember of the East African Community (EAC) regional economic\nbloc and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa\n(COMESA) trade blocs.\n8.\nImpact of the Country Profile on Adaptive Capacity\nThe geographical context of Kenya in the Greater Horn of Africa\nregion exposes the country to a level of climate variability that\npresents significant economic risks. The country experiences\nfrequent droughts that are punctuated by heavy rainfall events\nthat often result in flash floods. More than 70% of disasters\nfrom natural hazards are estimated to be attributable to extreme\nclimatic events.20 These disasters include major droughts that\noccur every 10 years, and moderate droughts or floods every\nthree to four years. The repeating cycles of floods and droughts\nhave had devastating socioeconomic impacts and high economic\n30\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\ncosts, have eroded the adaptive capacity of communities and\necosystems, and have negatively impacted livelihoods and the\noverall economy of the country. The 2008 – 2011 drought is\nestimated to have cost Kenya USD12.1 billion, including USD\n805.6 million for the destruction of physical and durable assets.21\nDroughts have affected more people than floods and have had\nthe greatest economic impact (averaging 8% of GDP every five\nyears).22 Although droughts often affect the whole country, the\nmost severe impacts are felt in the country’s highly arid zones,\nwhich include many of the poorest counties. The local economies\nin these counties depend heavily on pastoralism and the resulting\nrangeland degradation and loss of livestock erodes their capacity\nto cope and adapt to further climate impacts.\nIn Kenya, agriculture is the main productive sector and is critical\nfor food security and economic stability. The sector accounts for\napproximately 20% of Kenya’s GDP and employs more than 40%\nof the total population and more than 70% of the rural population.\n21 Government of Kenya. (2012).

Drought and floods cause significant\nloss of livestock, crops, and harvest resulting to loss of income\nand livelihoods at household level, and episodes of acute food\ninsecurity, particularly in the arid counties. Climate impacts on\nthe agriculture sector heavily affect young people by reducing\nincomes and limiting their transformation towards climate-smart\nor modernized agriculture which is capital-intensive.\nSocio-economic losses associated with climate change in Kenya\nover the past decade amounted to between 3% and 5% of GDP\nper annum.23 Modelling estimates in the LTLED strategy suggest\nthat Kenya’s losses could rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% of\nGDP per annum between 2021-2050.24 Kenya could lose up to\nUSD 11 billion each year because of climate change, however\nthe modelling indicates that about one-third of this loss can be\naverted through adaptation action.25 As such, adaptation is a\nprimary concern with respect to climate change.\n3.2.2.\nInstitutional Arrangements and Governance\nInclusion of diverse actors in climate change action, and particularly\nin adaptation supports compliance with the Constitution of Kenya\n2010, the Climate Change Act, 2016, and other subsidiary\nlegislation that provides for public participation in such matters.\nBelow is a summary of key institutions and actors responsible\nfor adaptation in Kenya and their roles.\nThe National Climate Change Council\nThe National Climate Change Council, established under the\nClimate Change Act, 2016 and chaired by the President, guides\nthe implementation of adaptation action and receives at least\nbi-annual reports on the implementation of NCCAPs. The\ncouncil’s mandate is to provide legislative and policy direction,\nsupervision, oversight and guidance on climate change across\nall levels of government. The Council will administer the climate\nfinance mechanism (Climate Change Fund), including approving\nrequests for funding, making funding allocation decisions, and\nimproving the tracking and coordination of climate finance.26\nThe Climate Change Directorate\nIn Kenya, climate action is coordinated by the Climate Change\nDirectorate (CCD), State Department of Environment and Climate\nChange, in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and\nForestry. The CCD is the National Focal Point for the UNFCCC\nand works under the guidance of various climate change policies\nand legislative frameworks including the Climate Change Act,\n2016. The Act designates CCD the lead agency of the government\non national climate change planning and action, including\ncoordination of adaptation planning.\nThe CCD has the central responsibility for coordination of\nreporting on adaptation, which requires coordination with other\ninstitutions with various mandates on reporting; expertise on\ndata collection, processing and reporting; data flows; systems\nand tools for adaptation action monitoring and reporting; and\nstakeholder engagement.\nSector Ministries\nSector Ministries lead on the implementation of adaptation action\nin their sectors, providing coordination with sector agencies and\nother key actors in their sectors as well as technical support in\nmainstreaming of climate adaptation actions in strategies and\nplans. The National Treasury, in the Ministry of Finance and\nPlanning is host to the Climate Change and Green Finance unit,\nand plays a key role in climate financing, including adaptation\nfinance. The National Treasury coordinates and facilitates activities\nrelated to climate finance, including leading the implementation\nof activities under the Financing Locally-led Climate Action\nprogram that has established county climate change funds in\nall 47 countries. The National Treasury is Kenya’s Nationally\nDesignated Authority for the Green Climate Fund.27\nNational Government Sector Agencies\nThese are tasked to integrate the National Climate Change\nAction Plan into their sectoral strategies, action plans and other\nimplementation projects; and designate a unit with adequate\nstaff and financial resources to coordinate the mainstreaming\nof the NCCAP and other climate change statutory functions\nand mandates into sectoral strategies for implementation.\n31\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nFor example, the NDMA coordinates the Kenya Food Security\nSteering Group, a multi-agency team that carries out biannual\nassessments of the impacts of short and long rains on food and\nnutrition security with a view of informing drought response and\nresilience building activities including adaptation to drought risk\n28 GoK.

All counties have designated\na County Executive Committee member responsible for climate\nchange and created a Climate Change Unit (CCU) to coordinate\nclimate change action. Many counties also have county and\nward climate change planning committees supporting locally-led\nplanning and implementation of climate adaptation actions. The\nWard Climate Change Planning Committees help communities\nto work in a participatory manner to analyse their resilience to\npresent and future climate risks and use the findings to prioritise\ninvestments that the County Climate Change Funds (CCCFs) can\nsupport. County level committees help to refine the investment\nplans from Wards and support prioritization based on available\nresources; membership of the County Climate Change Planning\nCommittees is drawn from county government departments,\nnational government institutional offices in the counties (e.g.,\nKenya Meteorological Department and National Environmental\nManagement Authority); non-governmental organisations (NGOs),\ncommunity-based organisations, the private sector, and local\ncommunities.\nPrivate sector\nThe private sector continues to engage and complement\ngovernment efforts on climate change and have been an\ninvaluable partner for adaptation action. Through the NAP\nReadiness Support Project (2018 – 2020) that was funded by the\nGreen Climate Fund (GCF) and implemented through the Food\nand Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Kenya Private Sector\nAlliance (KEPSA) created the Climate Business Information\nNetwork-Kenya (CBIN-K) and the Private Sector Strategy on\nClimate Change Solutions in Kenya (2022-2030).29\nPublic Benefit Organizations (NGOs, INGOs, CBOs)\nIn Kenya, the civil society is known to be a powerful agent of\nchange through public awareness creation, policy research and\nanalysis, and advocacy on key socio-economic issues including\nclimate change. They also undertake vulnerability assessments,\nbaseline studies and research; advocacy, capacity building\nand awareness creation; policy development and promotion of\ngood governance; information sharing; gender mainstreaming\nin climate change; monitoring and early warning systems;\nlivelihood support; promotion of improved technologies and\nefficient use of energy; humanitarian support; and promotion\nof use of indigenous knowledge. They play similar roles in the\nimplementation of adaptation actions.\nResearch and Academia\nThis group of actors plays a key role in building the country’s\nadaptive capacity. They help to provide the evidence for knowledgebased decision making by the national and county governments,\nprivate sector, development partners and civil society amongst\nothers. This is done through research conducted on different\naspects of climate change adaptation and resilience, including\nimproving the understanding of climate change attribution in\nKenya and providing information on the appropriate mix of\nadaptation actions in order to avoid maladaptation.\nThe Media\nThe media in Kenya provides vital information at times of\nemergency — from warning of imminent floods to explaining\nhow to deal with drought emergencies and disease outbreaks.\nMedia houses are actively involved in the dissemination of\nclimate information, including progress on the implementation\nof adaptation activities. Strategic actions that improve climate\nchange journalism can themselves be forms of adaptation\nbecause accurate, timely and relevant information is a critical\ncomponent of resilience. During the Africa Climate Change Week\nand Summit in Nairobi in 2023, the media played a great role\neducating the public and disseminating progress and outcomes\nfrom the meeting.\n32\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nFigure 3-4: Climate Change Institutional Coordination Structures in Climate Change Act 2016 (Source: National Adaptation\nPlan, 2015)\n3.2.3.\nLegal and Policy Frameworks, Strategies and Plans\nKenya has a strong history of climate change governance beginning\nwith the enactment of the new constitution and development\nof the National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) in\n2010. The policy and legal framework for adaptation includes\nthree National Climate Change Action Plans (2013 - 2017, 2018\n- 2022, 2023 - 2027), NAP (2015 - 2030), and Climate Change\nAct 2016. Kenya submitted her first Nationally Determined\nContribution (NDC) in 2016 and an updated version in 2020.\nThe NDC responds to both domestic needs and international\nobligations under the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement and includes\na section on adaptation priorities that are aligned with the NAP\nand NCCAPs. As stated in the NCCAPs, NAP, and NDC, adaptation\nis the priority for Kenya.\nIn Kenya, climate change issues are given a high priority, as such\nthe Ministry of Environment and Forestry was re-designated in\nOctober 2022 to include climate change, and is now referred to\nas the Ministry of Environment Climate Change and Forestry\n(MoECCF).\nLaws and Policies\nTable 3-1:\n Summary of the key legal and policy documents related to climate adaptation\nLaw\nDescription\nThe Constitution of Kenya,\n2010\nThe mother law in Kenya. Article 42 establishes Kenyans’ right to a clean and healthy environment\nincluding the right to have the environment protected for the benefit of present and future\ngenerations. A healthy environment calls for the sustainable use of ecosystems and consequently\ncontinued access to ecosystem goods and the services they provide which are critical for\nadaptation.\nClimate Change Act, 2016\nThe Climate Change Act enacted in 2016 was the first comprehensive legal framework for climate\nchange governance in Kenya with the objective of enhancing climate resilient development\nthrough among others promoting the uptake of technologies that support low carbon and climate\nresilient development; facilitating capacity development for public participation in climate change\nresponses through awareness creation, consultation, representation and access to information;\nand providing incentives and obligations for private sector contributions towards climate resilient\ndevelopment. Additionally, the Act provides for and supports mainstreaming of climate adaptation\nactions into development planning, decision-making, and implementation. It sets out principles for\nclimate change planning and implementation of measures, and recognises the complementary\nrole of national and county governments. The latter is critical considering the local nature of\nadaptation. The 2023 amendment provided for the introduction and regulation of carbon markets\nin Kenya, which provide a potential source of finance for adaptation actions.\n33\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nLaw\nDescription\nUrban Areas and Cities\n(Amendment) Act, 2019\nThe urban development legislation provides for the establishment and governance of urban areas\n(i.e., cities, municipalities, towns, and market centres). The legislation provides the legal mandate\nfor planning and development in urban areas, and the implementation of key actions in these\nareas, which contributes to the balance between urbanisation and sustainable development.\nThese bodies play a key role in integrating climate resilience considerations and adaptation\nactions in urban centres.\nThe National Drought\nManagement Authority Act,\n2016\nCreates the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) as a permanent institution with a\nspecific mandate of managing drought in a more pro-active and sustainable manner. It recognises\ndrought as the most important climate-related hazard for Kenya and the need to sustainably\ninvest in building resilience to drought in a coordinated manner. The Act also establishes the\nNational Drought Emergency Fund to finance timely responses to drought and to support capacity\nstrengthening in drought management.\nEnvironmental Management\nand Coordination (Amendment)\nAct, 2015\nEmphasises maximum participation by stakeholders in the development and implementation\nof policies, plans, and processes for the management of the environment and provides for the\nrelevant institutional framework for the coordination of environmental management including\nthe NCCAPs. The Act provides for environmental protection through environmental impact\nassessment; environmental audit and monitoring; and environmental restoration orders,\nconservation orders, and easements.\nPolicy\nDescription\nNationally Determined\nContribution, 2020\nThe updated NDC communicated the country’s adaptation priorities and needs to the international\ncommunity. The NDC prioritises adaptation and sets out adaptation actions and approaches that\nare aligned with Kenya’s NAP and NCCAP. The adaptation goal is a climate resilient society that\nis to be achieved through mainstreaming climate adaptation in Medium Term Plans (MTPs) and\nCountry Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs).\nNational Climate Change\nFramework Policy, 2018\nFormulated to ensure the integration of climate change considerations into planning, budgeting,\nimplementation, and decision-making at the national and county levels, and across all sectors.\nThe goal is to promote climate resilient development through pursuing several objectives\nincluding providing an effective and efficient institutional framework for mainstreaming climate\nchange; reducing vulnerability and catalysing the transition to climate-resilient development;\nincentivising private sector involvement; and providing a framework for resource mobilisation in\nsupport of adaptation\nNational Climate Finance\nPolicy, 2018\nEstablishes the legal, institutional, and reporting frameworks to access and manage climate\nfinance, consistent with the institutional structures and framework set out in the Climate Change\nAct, 2016. Interventions with respect to this policy include establishing a national Climate Change\nFund, identifying climate financing sources, and creating a national system for tracking climate\nfinance. Its operationalisation is meant to address the issue of inadequate finance for adaptation\ninterventions.\nNational Urban Development\nPolicy, 2016\nThe urban development policy, together with the Urban Areas and Cities (Amendment) Act,\n2019, provide a framework for the establishment and governance of urban areas (i.e., cities,\nmunicipalities, towns, and market centres). The policy guides planning and development in urban\nareas, and the implementation of key actions in these areas, which contributes to the balance\nbetween urbanisation and sustainable development. These bodies play a key role in integrating\nclimate resilience considerations and adaptation actions in urban centres.\n34\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nStrategies and Plans\nTable 3-2:\n Summary of national and sectoral strategy and planning documents related to climate adaptation\nStrategy/Plan\nDescription\nNationally Determined\nContribution, 2020\nThe updated NDC communicated the country’s adaptation priorities and needs to the\ninternational community. The NDC prioritises adaptation and sets out adaptation actions and\napproaches that are aligned with Kenya’s NAP and NCCAP. The adaptation goal is a climate\nresilient society that is to be achieved through mainstreaming climate adaptation in Medium\nTerm Plans (MTPs) and Country Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs).\nNational Climate Change Action\nPlans (2013 - 2017); (2018 -\n2022); (2023 - 2027)\nA five-year iterative tool for mainstreaming climate actions across all sectors of the economy\nand the two levels of government. Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate change in priority\nsectors include the policies and strategies, coordination structures, planning cycles (guidelines\nand templates), investments, and financing. It is used for implementing both the NDC and\nNAP and most of the actions are adaptation. The NCCAP was updated in 2023. Updating\nand/or revision of the NCCAP is an inclusive process involving both levels of governments,\nprivate sector, research and academia, communities, CSOs, media, and other actors in climate\nadaptation.\nGuidance on Climate-related Risk\nManagement, 2021\nThis guidance, issued by the Central Bank of Kenya, aims to guide institutions licensed\nunder the Banking Act on climate-related risk management. The guidance sets out basic\nrequirements for financial institutions in regard to the identification, management, and\nreporting of climate-related risks, including physical risks that result from the impacts of\nclimate- and weather-related events.\nNational Biodiversity Strategy and\nAction Plan, 2019 - 2030\nGuides strategies aimed at addressing declining biodiversity and related challenges. It aims\nto reduce the loss of biodiversity, promote the value of biodiversity, and improve community\nlivelihoods. Highlighted adaptation interventions include conservation of agricultural\nbiodiversity through increased support to local communities in the production and sustainable\nutilisation of indigenous and/or traditional species for food and other uses; strengthening\ninstitutional and community capacity and linkages; promotion of gender equity in biodiversity\nmanagement; and supporting and promoting the utilisation of indigenous knowledge,\ninnovations, and practices among others.\nKenya Climate-Smart Agriculture\nImplementation Framework, 2018\n- 2027\nProvides guidelines for the implementation of the CSA strategy at national and county\nlevels in support of food security and economic development. The national government is\nlargely expected to lead on policy development and support capacity building, while county\ngovernments lead on implementation since agriculture is a devolved function.\nKenya Climate-Smart Agriculture\nStrategy, 2017 - 2026\nAims to improve productivity and build the resilience of agricultural systems while minimising\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Recognises the high vulnerability of the agriculture sector and\nidentifies priority interventions for building resilience of the sector through the implementation\nof Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices in the crop, livestock, and fisheries sectors in\nsupport of food and nutrition security and poverty reduction.\nClimate Risk Management\nFramework, 2017\nThe framework bridges climate change adaptation, disaster risk management, and\nsustainable development at national and county levels. The framework ensures that the three\ndistinct entities are pursued as mutually supportive rather than stand-alone goals and that\nan integrated approach to climate risk management becomes a key component of policy\nand strategy for resilience building. The adaptation actions under this framework include\nanalysing exposure and vulnerability to disasters, and capacity to respond; mobilising financial\nresources for climate risk management; designing and implementing pilot projects for climate\nrisk management at county and national levels; enhancing research and dissemination of\ninformation about climate risk management; and building capacity at national and county\nlevels for integrated climate risk management.\nNational Adaptation Plan 2015 -\n2030\nThe long-term plan aims at consolidating the country’s vision on adaptation by supporting\nmacro-level adaptation actions that are aligned with the economic sectors and addressing\ncounty-level vulnerabilities to enhance long-term resilience and adaptive capacity. It is\nimplemented through the five-year NCCAPs. The NAP highlights climate vulnerabilities and\npriority areas for building climate resilience. It presents adaptation actions that cover the\ntime frame 2015 - 2030 and builds on the foundation laid by the National Climate Change\nResponse Strategy (NCCRS) and the NCCAP 2013-2017. Furthermore, it is the basis for the\nadaptation component of Kenya’s NDC.\n35\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nStrategy/Plan\nDescription\nNational Climate Change\nResponse Strategy, 2010\nThe NCCRS formally recognised the need for coordinated efforts in addressing climate\nchange issues in Kenya. It recommended the development of a climate change policy and\nlegislation on which adaptation activities were to be anchored. Consequently, a stand-alone\nclimate change act and related governance structures and plans (e.g., NCCAP and NAP) were\ndeveloped and supported coordinated adaptation action. Some of the priority adaptation\nactions highlighted in the climate change response strategy included: promoting orphan crops;\nagricultural produce post-harvest processing, storage, and value addition; breeding of animals\nfrom various agro-ecological zones that adapt well to climatic variances; providing special\nlivestock insurance; establishing a national climate awareness campaign; and incorporating\nclimate change in the school curriculum within Information and awareness building.\n3.2.4.\nSub-national Level Legal Frameworks, Policies and Strategies\n30 Government of Kenya. (2024).\nThe Climate Change Act, 2016 requires county governments to\nintegrate climate change actions into their plans and policies.\nCounty governments have progressively been incorporating\nclimate change initiatives into their plans and programmes\nas mandated, making use of the five- year County Integrated\nDevelopment Plan (CIDP) process as the main instruments to\nmainstream climate change actions in development planning.\nTypically, the CIDPs integrate adaptation actions alongside\nmitigation and other types of climate resilience interventions\nincluding enabling actions like climate finance, which is now\nlegally mandated in all 47 counties through climate changespecific policies and legislation.30\nSome counties have also developed strategies and regulations\nto operationalise climate-related legislation. The County Climate\nChange Fund (CCCF) mechanism that aims to enhance access\nand channel climate finance to the community level is now\nestablished and operational in the 47 counties in Kenya. Through\nthis mechanism, each county government sets aside a minimum\nof 1.5% of their development budgets for climate actions,\nallocated through the respective County Climate Change Fund. In\naddition, County Climate Change Action Plans are mainstreamed\ninto the County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) that are\nimplemented over five years through the Annual Development\nPlans (ADPs). Many counties have climate change governance\nstructures down to the ward level which is the lowest administrative\nand planning unit. Local communities are facilitated to identify\nand prioritise mostly climate adaptation interventions through\nparticipatory processes, which are then financed using their\nCCCF. This is achieved with the support of the climate change\nplanning committees at the county and ward levels, making use\nof relevant resilience planning tools and climate information.\nCase study:\n CCCF Mechanism as a strategy for adaptation\nThe integration of climate information into planning and implementation has been supported through county-specific\nClimate Information Services (CIS) plans prepared by the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD), working with other\npartners. These CIS plans support effective, locally-led adaptation because they are based on local needs and contribute\nto improved access and use of climate information at institutional and household levels. Designated agencies for disaster\nmanagement also make use of climate information services at the sub-national level for preparedness and response. For\nexample, the NDMA currently supports the 23 ASAL counties with Drought Early Warnings that are issued monthly to aid\ndrought preparedness and early action.\nThe CCCF mechanism was initially piloted and operationalized in rural counties; however, the more complex urban contexts\nwith projected exponential population growth required a tailored approach. Through urban policy and legislation, Kenya has\n5 cities and over 70 municipalities with governance structures that support integration of local climate actions including the\nmainstreaming of climate-resilient development pathways in the provision of necessary urban infrastructure and services.\nNairobi and Mombasa cities have just set up their CCCF mechanisms with support from FLLoCA programme.\n36\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n3.2.5.\nCapacity-building and Capacity Gaps and Needs\n31 Nying’uro et al.

Institutional and technical capacity\ndevelopment is critical in the delivery of proposed adaptation\nactions as prioritized in national planning documents and country\nplans. The Climate Change Act 2016 established a number of\ninstitutions and set mandates for existing institutions in regard\nto climate action in Kenya. Significant progress has been made\non operationalisation and strengthening of the institutional\nstructures set out in the Climate Change Act (Amendment, 2023),\nincluding the National Climate Change Council, CCD, National\nEnvironment Management Authority (NEMA), Climate Change\nFund, Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD), Kenya\nSchool of Government (KSG), Council of Governors (CoG), and\nClimate Change Units both at national and county level. It is\nnotable that to more effectively support climate action, including\nclimate adaptation, the National Climate Change Fund became\noperational in 2022 and is managed by the National Treasury.\nClimate Change Units at both national and county government\nlevels also have focal points, officers leading and coordinating on\nclimate action. Gaps and needs on capacity building are further\ndiscussed in section 3.5.3 (3) on capacity needs.\n3.3. Climate Change Hazards, vulnerabilities and impacts\nin Kenya\nThis section includes a summary of key climate hazards,\nvulnerabilities, and risks and impacts on different sectors of\nthe economy. The information in this section draws on Kenya’s\nAdaptation Communication (2024 draft), as well as county level\nParticipatory Climate Risk Assessments facilitated through the\nFinancing Locally-Led Climate Action (FLLoCA) program under\nthe National Treasury & Economic Planning.\n3.3.1.\nClimate Hazards\n Analysis in the Kenya National Adaptation Plan (2015 – 2030)\nand the National Climate Change Action Plans demonstrates\nthat Kenya is exposed to climate hazards and details the\nactual biophysical events that are driven by climate change.\nIt is estimated that over 70% of natural disasters in Kenya are\nattributable to extreme climatic events – particularly flooding\nand droughts. Evidence shows that climate change increased\nthe intensity of rainfall in the short rainy season in the Horn of\nAfrica in 2023, leading to severe flash flooding in the eastern\nregion which caused more than 300 deaths and displaced over a\nmillion people.31 Studies have not reached consensus on whether\ndroughts have been increasing or decreasing overall in East\nAfrica since the 1950s; however, research indicates that since\n2005, droughts have doubled in frequency from once every six\nyears to once every three years in the region.32 Typically, major\ndroughts occur in cycles of approximately ten years, and moderate\ndroughts or floods have become common every three to four\nyears. Apart from eroding the capacity to adapt, the repeating\ncycles of flooding and droughts have socio-economic impacts\nand high economic costs.\nFor example, the 1998 to 2000 drought cost an estimated US$2.8\nbillion, principally due to crops and livestock loss, as well as forest\nfires, damage to fisheries, reduced hydropower generation, reduced\nindustrial production and reduced water supplies.33 Another\nsevere and prolonged drought from 2008–2011 affected 3.7\nmillion people, caused US$12.1 billion in damages and losses,\nand cost over US$1.7 billion in recovery and reconstruction\nneeds.34 Figure 3.5 below demonstrates the number of people\naffected by key natural hazards between 1980 and 2020.\n37\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n35 Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD).

These are analysed in the draft AdCom (2024) and\nsummarised below.\na.\nTemperature Increase\nThe KMD estimates that Kenya’s mean annual temperature has\nincreased by 1.0°C since 1960, at an average rate of 0.21°C\nper decade and projects that it will continue rising by 1.7°C by\nthe 2050s.35 In the same report, the KMD reported that several\nweather stations in 2022 recorded maximum temperature values\nexceeding long-term averages, and minimum temperatures\nthat were higher than long-term averages. Increased heat and\nextreme heat conditions will result in significant implications for\nhuman and animal health, agriculture, and ecosystems. Recent\nanalysis by the World Bank presented in their climate knowledge\nportal demonstrates evidence of increased temperature in\nrecent years (1990 – 2020), compared to the natural variability\nrecorded over 1951-2020.\n38\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n36 World Bank (2024).

Average rainfall is expected to increase by\nmid-century, particularly during the ‘short rains’, which occur\nbetween October and December.37 Increased aridity and drought\nhave been observed, with extreme rainfall events occurring with\ngreater frequency and intensity. Extreme events from 2018 to\n2024 in Kenya included flash floods, floods, landslides, and rising\nlake levels.38 A climate change vulnerability assessment in the\nUpper Ewaso Nyiro basin (an ASAL ecosystem) showed that\nthere has been high climate variability over 30 years especially\nwithin the long rains in March, April, and May.39\nc.\nSea Level Rise and Temperature Increase\n Kenya is experiencing sea level rise, and the rate of sea level\nrise along the Western Indian Ocean is estimated to be 4.0mm/\nyear compared to the global average of 3.4mm/year.40 Sea levels\nare expected to continue to rise along Kenya’s coast (Figure\n3.7 illustrates the expected increase under Representative\nConcentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5, which is the Intergovernmental\nPanel on Climate Change’s moderate scenario in which greenhouse\ngas emissions peak around 2040 and then decline). Increasing\nsea surface temperatures, marine heatwaves, and ocean\nacidification alongside rising sea levels and stronger storm\nsurges impact marine life, lead to coastal erosion, and increase\nthe risk of flooding in the five coastal counties (Kwale, Mombasa,\nKilifi, Tana River, and Lamu). Global projections of 21–48 cm\nof sea level rise by the end of the 21st century compared with\nthe 1980–1999 average could be devastating for Kenya.41 A 30\ncm increase in sea level rise could submerge 17% of the city of\nMombasa, Kenya’s second largest city and the largest seaport\nin East Africa.42\n39\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n43 [1] IPCC.

The IPCC defines vulnerability as “the propensity\nor predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses\na variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or\nsusceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.”43\nThe IPCC framework demonstrates that climate risks are the\nproduct of the interaction between climate hazards, vulnerability\nand exposure of the relevant systems, sectors or populations.\nKenya ranked 135th out of 187 countries in 2022 according to\nthe Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) index,\nwhich ranks countries on their level of vulnerability to climate\nchange and readiness to implement adaptation solutions44 (See\nfigure 3.8). it was the 135th most vulnerable country and the 146th\nmost ready country – implying that it is very vulnerable to, yet\nunready to combat the impacts of climate change.45\nFigure 3-8:\n ND-GAIN Index for Kenya: Vulnerability Dimension (World Bank, 2024)\n The summary in table 3 demonstrates that the high levels of\nclimate vulnerability in Kenya are attributable to a number of\nkey factors: a low-lying coastline; heavy dependence on rainfed\nagriculture; water scarcity; insecure land tenure; environmental\ndegradation; and conflicts over natural resources like water and\npasture during the very dry seasons.46 Apart from low-lying coastal\nregions that are very exposed to sea level rise, communities and\nsystems in the ASALs, which constitute up to 89% of the land\narea and 38% of the country’s total population,47 are particularly\nvulnerable to climate change because of high levels of poverty\n40\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nwhich limit their adaptive capacity and increase their exposure\nto recurring droughts.

Floods in 2023 affected 38\ncounties across Kenya, resulting in loss of lives, injuries, displacements,\nand destruction of key infrastructure. An increase in contaminated water\nalso led to secondary effects, including vector and waterborne disease\noutbreaks. 757,173 people (138,560 households) were affected since the\nonset of the short rains season between October and December 2023.52\n• In March 2023, heavy rains led to widespread flooding across several\ncounties, including Mombasa, Kwale, Tana River, and others. These\nfloods resulted in 36 fatalities and left 29 people injured, affecting a total\nof 139,135 individuals. Infrastructure damage, particularly to roads and\nhomes, compounded the impact on affected communities.53\n42\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nSector\nRisks\nImpacts\nFood Nutrition\nand Security\nChanges in temperature\nregimes and precipitation\npatterns (associated with\ninsufficient availability of water,\nexcessive moisture conditions,\npests, diseases, and weeds)\n• The 2014-2018 drought was declared a national emergency in February\n2017, having affected 23 out of the 47 counties, with counties in ASALs\nbeing the most affected with at least 3.4 million people being severely food\ninsecure.54\n• The cumulative impact of the below-average short rains in 2018 followed by\nthe poor 2019 long rains season increased the number of people in Kenya\naffected by food insecurity.55 from 0.7 million in late 2018 to 3.1 million in\nlate 2019\n• The biggest impacts are expected on maize and wheat production owing to\ntheir high vulnerability to heat stress. Maize is the staple food in Kenya while\nwheat-based foods are an important source of nutrition.\n• Heavy rainfall has led to increased flows on large rivers, such as the Tana,\nresulting in flooded farmlands, degraded soils and reduced farm output.56\n• Heavy rains in 2019 and 2020 created conditions conducive to the severe\ndesert locust outbreaks in 2020 which affected the food supply of about 2.5\nmillion people and livelihoods of some 3.5 million people.\n• Overall, between 2014 and 2023, when an estimated 5.1 million Kenyans\n(27% of the ASAL population) were facing high levels of acute food\ninsecurity and in need of humanitarian assistance because of drought.57\n• Recurring droughts coupled by increased demand for land have forced\nan estimated 30% of livestock owners out of pastoralism over the past 20\nyears.58\n• From 2007 to 2017, losses in livestock populations due to drought-related\ncauses amounted to about USD 1.08 billion.59\n• The effects of climate-related temperature rise on human labour is also\nlinked to impacts on food and nutrition. High temperatures induce heat\nstress among farm workers, further reducing agricultural productivity.60\n• Even with ambitious action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the area\nof farmland optimal for tea production in Kenya is projected to decrease by\n26% by 2050.\n54 KMD. 2024.

It has been estimated that between\n1995 and 2019, the percentage of Kenyans living under water-stressed\nconditions increased from 14.8% to 33.2%, partly attributed to climate\nchange impacts.61\n• Climate change impacts on water resources have affected agriculture\nthrough loss of crops, human health through water-borne diseases\nassociated with flooding and destruction of key related infrastructure.\n• Increase in water demand from population growth and an expanding\neconomy compounds the water availability challenges presented by climate\nchange.62 For example, during long dry spells like in 2018, many urban areas\nfaced acute water shortages due to low water levels in rivers.\n• Changes in rainfall have increased water levels in Kenyan lakes.63 The\nincrease in the area of lakes in the Great Rift Valley, ranging from a\n21% increase for Lake Naivasha to a 123% increase for Lake Solai, has\ncontributed to changes in flora and fauna and affected local communities\nthat rely on these natural aquatic resources.64\n• Climate change is also causing storms and rougher seas, which prevents\nfisher communities from earning a living and obtaining fish for sustenance,\nespecially in the months of May, June, and July.\n• Crop production may be hampered by salt stress brought on by the\nwaterlogging of the soils. Additionally, because saline water intrusion\nimpacts coastal ecosystems, the health of coastal inhabitants is at stake.65\n• Sea level rise is a risk to the five coastal counties and their populations; an\nestimated 267,000 Kenyans will be at risk of coastal flooding by 2030 due\nto sea level rise.\n• Sea level rise is projected to increase the levels of salinity in coastal\nfreshwater aquifers, which would exacerbate the current water supply\nissues.\nForestry, Wildlife\nand Tourism\nRising temperatures and\nchanging precipitation\npatterns; prolonged droughts\nand flooding\n• Forest degradation, damage and transformation of forest areas, and\nchanges in species composition\n• Prolonged droughts weaken forests, making them more susceptible to\npests, diseases, and forest fires, further contributing to their degradation.\nWildfires are particularly common during dry seasons and destroy large\nforests areas whenever they occur.\n• Rainfall variability and prolonged drought are already altering wildlife\nmigrations, affecting tourist visits on big nature reserves such as the\nMaasai Mara.66\n61 Nying’uro et al., (2024)\n62 GoK.

This affects the provision of water, food and timber;\nair purification; carbon sequestration; flood control; soil and habitats; and\ncultural, spiritual and recreational services.\n• Climate change facilitates the spread and establishment of many Invasive\nAlien Species (IAS) and creates new opportunities for them to become\ninvasive with devastating impacts on the native species and biodiversity.67\n• Projections indicate that species richness along the Tana River basin – an\neconomically important and ecologically diverse region – is projected to\nreduce significantly with just 2°C of global temperature rise with plants and\nbirds most affected. And the impacts worsen with further warming. While\n82% of the basin can offer protection for the majority of plant species with\n1.5°C of warming, this figure reduces to 23% with 2°C of warming and to\njust 3% with 4.5°C of warming.68\n• There will be a substantial climate-driven shift in vegetation towards\nmore shrubland (normally associated with arid lands) at the expense of\nsavannahs, grasslands and forests. Consequently, protected areas in Kenya\ncould lose between 16% and 50% of their forests, depending on future\nemissions.69\nHealth,\nSanitation\nand Human\nSettlement\nRising temperatures,\nheatwaves and changing\nprecipitation patterns\nsuch as more frequent\nand heavier rain events,\nwater encroachment, over\nabstraction of groundwater,\nstorm surges in coastal areas\n–\n.\n• Increase in malaria vectors and migration to new areas. Higher\ntemperatures contribute to extending the risk of malaria to new areas.\nApproximately 13 to 20 million Kenyans are at risk of malaria, and\nvulnerable populations especially pregnant women, children, the elderly and\nthose with pre-existing health conditions are particularly at risk.\n• Increase in acute respiratory infections for ASAL areas; emergence and reemergence of Rift Valley fever and leishmaniasis, and malnutrition\n• The outbreak of water- and vector-borne diseases during periods of flooding\nis an established public health concern in Kenya impacting public health\nexpenditure and driving mortality especially among infants. For example, as\nof 2nd October 2023, a total of twelve thousand, one hundred and twentythree (12,123) vector-borne disease cases, with six hundred and twentyseven (627) confirmed by culture, and two hundred and two (202) deaths\nwere reported (Ministry of Health, 2023).70\n• Weather-related deaths are a particular public health concern in informal\nsettlements, with research finding an increase in child mortality and in\ndeaths from non-communicable illnesses, such as cardiovascular and\nrespiratory diseases, with increasing temperature.\n• Climate change has been identified as a factor contributing to the increased\nburden of zoonotic diseases in Kenya, such as Brucellosis, Anthrax and Rift\nValley fever.71\n• Shifting climatic patterns and extreme weather events damage and\nincrease the risk of collapse of buildings and infrastructure.72\n• Prolonged drought has negatively impacted the supply of building materials\nsuch as timber, while also reducing water levels, which then impacts the\ncost of electricity.73\n67 C Muhati, G.

For example, the heavy\nrainfall experienced throughout the year 2023 resulted in destruction of\nroads across different parts of the country. Several roads were cut off by\nflash floods in Tana River, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera.76\n• The Kenya Highways Authority participated in a vulnerability assessment\nof the Horn of Africa Gateway project, a large road infrastructure project,\nthat found projected increased rainfall is expected to increase the risk of\nflooding, erosion, washouts, and siltation, and to aggravate connectivity\nproblems. 77\n• Climate-related weather extremes also impact the design, construction,\nlocation, and operation of electricity generation and transmission\ninfrastructure. For example, a vulnerability assessment of hydroelectric\nenergy resources impacted by climate change in the Seven Forks project\nfound that the catchment temperature is rising by 0.02°C annually while the\nrains are declining by 3.9 mm annually.\n• The rapid decline of Mount Kenya’s glaciers is affecting hydropower\ngeneration, which is currently extremely reliant on the Mount Kenya region,\nwith the Tana River contributing around 70% of Kenya’s total hydropower\ngeneration.78\n• Masinga dam, one of the main Seven Forks reservoirs for hydroelectric\npower production along the Tana River, faces inflow drop of 0.74 cubic\nmetres of water per second annually, leading to an average power output\nbelow capacity by up to 16-Gigawatt hours annually.79\n3.4.

(2023).\nKenya is a party to many multilateral environmental agreements\nwhose implementation has synergies with the actions to achieve\nthe goals of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. These\nagreements include:\n\t•\nUN Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development and the\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs);\n\t•\nThe other two Rio conventions (UN Convention on Biological\nDiversity and UN Convention to Combat Desertification\nand Land Degradation);\n\t•\nSendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction;\n\t•\nMontreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances; and\n\t•\nRamsar Convention on Wetlands.\nThe country has made significant strides in domesticating\nthe multilateral environmental agreements and continues\nto implement resulting policies and strategies on the same.\nThe local frameworks, policies, plans and their implementing\ninstitutions build from domesticated global frameworks and\ndraw from them synergies that are essential for implementation\nof climate change adaptation action in Kenya. The most notable\nones are presented in Table 3.8.\nTable 3-8:\n Global Climate Adaptation Frameworks and their Synergy with Kenyan Frameworks, Policies, Plans and Institutions for Climate\nAdaptation\nFrameworks\nSynergy with local frameworks, policies, plans and institutions for Climate Adaptation\nUN Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals\nand 2030 Agenda for\nSustainable Development\nThe NCCAP 2023-2027 demonstrates systemic alignment with the SDGs and disaster risk reduction\nagendas through a shared vision for climate-resilient development stemming from the recognition that\nclimate change is a threat to sustainable development in Kenya. The NCCAP 2018-2022 identified the\nSDG benefits of climate action, including climate adaptation, and the relevant SDG indicators.\nBeing a highly vulnerable country with a significant proportion of the population living below the poverty\nline and directly dependent on the natural resources, the adaptation actions in the NCCAP 20232027 have been framed in such a way that they address the multiple objectives of building resilience,\nreducing poverty, and supporting environmental sustainability.\nAn SDG Coordination Directorate was created under the State Department of Economic Planning,\nNational Treasury and Economic Planning, to provide leadership in mainstreaming the SDGs in\nplanning, policies, and budgeting at national and county levels. It also coordinates tracking and\nreporting on SDGs. This has ensured that the five-year MTPs and CIDPs mainstream the SDGs, climate\nchange adaptation, and disaster risk management.80\nUNFCCC Paris\nAgreement; Sendai\nFramework for Disaster\nRisk Reduction\n\nThe Government of Kenya has taken significant steps to align efforts under the Paris Agreement\nand the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Drawing from the two global frameworks,\nKenya developed the Climate Risk Management Framework (2016) to foster stronger coordination\namong government institutions working on climate change adaptation, disaster risk management,\nand sustainable development at both national and sub-national levels. The framework focusses on\nhydrometeorological disasters considering their frequency and wide-ranging impacts on society and\nthe economy.\nImplementation of this framework is enhancing synergy, efficiency, and impact in climate adaptation\nand resilience building across institutions and the two levels of government, regionally and\ninternationally.81\n3.5. Adaptation strategies, policies, goals and plans\nFollowing the launch of Vision 2030 to guide Kenya’s long-term\ndevelopment in 200882, the country put in place the National\nClimate Change Response Strategy, 2010 in recognition of\nthe impact of climate change on this vision. The strategy\nacknowledged the importance of coordinating efforts to address\nclimate change challenges in Kenya and essentially advocated\nfor the creation of a climate change policy and legislation to\nserve as the foundation for adaptation efforts. It called for and\nprovided the foundation for the development of a standalone\nclimate change act, as well as related governance structures\nand programmes (e.g., NCCAP and NAP).\nIn 2015, Kenya established its National Adaptation Plan (NAP)\n2015–2030 drawing on the adaptation technical analysis of\nNCCAP 2013-2017. The NAP was submitted to the UNFCCC in\nearly 2017; it aims to consolidate the country’s adaptation vision\nby supporting macro-level adaptation initiatives aligned with\neconomic sectors and addressing county-level vulnerabilities to\nimprove long-term resilience and adaptive capability. Implemented\nthrough the five-year NCCAPs, the NAP identifies climate\nvulnerabilities and key areas for enhancing climate resilience.\nImportantly, the NAP serves as the foundation for Kenya’s NDC’s\nadaptation component.83\n51\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nThe Climate Change Act Number 11 of 2016 and Climate Change\nAct 2016 establish the legal architecture to guide climate change\nplanning and implementation at the national and county levels.\nIt provides the legal basis for mainstreaming climate change in\nnational and county planning and establishes the institutional\nstructures for coordination of climate change issues. It is a\ncomprehensive legal framework for climate change governance,\nwith the goal of enhancing climate-resilient development by,\namong other things, promoting the adoption of technologies\nthat support low carbon and climate-resilient development;\nfacilitating capacity development for public participation in climate\nchange responses through awareness creation, consultation,\nrepresentation, and access to information; and providing\nincessant access to information. Furthermore, the Act calls\nfor and encourages the incorporation of climate adaptation\nmeasures into development planning, decision-making, and\nexecution. It establishes guidelines for climate change planning\nand implementation and acknowledges the complementary roles\nof national and county governments. Given the local character of\nadaptation, the latter is crucial.84 Other legal, policy and planning\ninstruments are summarised below:\n\t•\nBottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda (BETA):\nKenya’s 2023–2027 planning period focuses on the BETA\nthemes of Agricultural Transformation; Micro, Small and\nMedium Enterprises (MSME) Economy; Housing and\nSettlement; Healthcare; and Digital Superhighway and\n84 GoK.

This intervention aims at ensuring food security in the country through\nclimate change mitigation and adaptation, thereby reducing the cost of living. The intervention also aims at creating jobs\nas agriculture has the highest employment multiplier effect owing to its strong forward and backward linkages to other\nsectors of the economy. It also focuses on developing Kenya’s agricultural land through irrigation.\nMicro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME). This entails correcting market and institution failure problems through\nschemes that will ensure that benefits of growth are fairly distributed. This will promote accessibility to affordable credit\nto most Kenyans at the bottom of the pyramid through the Hustlers Fund.\nHousing and Settlement. This intervention aims at reducing proliferation of slums and hence preserving human dignity.\nAdditionally, it aims to create quality jobs for over 100,000 youths. This will be done through, among other measures,\nfacilitating delivery of 250,000 houses per annum and enabling low-cost housing mortgages.\nHealthcare. This entails promoting access to quality and affordable healthcare through the Universal Health Coverage\nprogramme.\nKenya’s NCCAP 2023-2027 sets out priority adaptation actions in\nseven strategic areas.

The policy establishes DRM\ninstitutions that address prevention, preparedness, relief,\nrehabilitation, mitigation, and prevention. The DRM policy\nalso provides for a County Disaster Risk Management\nCommittee in each county.\n\t•\nFor improved access to Climate Information Services\nto support risk-informed adaptation planning, the Kenya\nMeteorological Department (KMD) reached an additional\n1,011,583 users with climate information services in the\nform of daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal forecasts\nand advisories.92\n\t•\nAnticipatory action approaches in dealing with drought\nand flooding are being developed by the Kenyan Red Cross\nSociety with improved climate information services from\nthe Kenya Meteorological Department; the CIS is critical\nfor the effective management of climate-related disasters.\n\t•\nCounty disaster management legislation, plans, and\ncoordinating units/committees were established in six\ncounties to improve coordination and management of\nclimate-related risks.\n\t•\nRelief assistance provided to persons affected by food\ninsecurity as a result of floods and droughts in the year\n2023/24. Over 1,463,354 persons benefitted from the relief\nassistance in the ASAL counties and Bomet, Bungoma,\nBusia, Elgeyo Marakwet, Homabay, Kiambu, Kirinyaga,\nNairobi, Mombasa and Nakuru\n2.\nFood and Nutrition Security\nAgriculture is a priority for Kenya because of the sector’s\nimportance to food security, rural livelihoods, and poverty\nalleviation. An increased incidence of drought and unreliable\nrainfall affect agriculture and contribute to food insecurity and\npoor nutrition in Kenya. The Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture\nStrategy (2017-2026) and Kenya CSA Implementation Framework\n(2018-2027) were developed with the objectives of increasing\nproductivity, building resilience, and enhancing co-benefits along\nthe diverse agricultural value chains. The strategy builds on the\nNCCAP and NAP and was largely driven by the important role\nof agriculture within the Kenyan economy and the high levels\nof vulnerability in the sector.\nThe National Agricultural (Crops, livestock and fisheries) Insurance\nPolicy was developed to enhance the growth and development\nof agriculture insurance in the country including participation\nof the private sector. Agriculture insurance is one way to de-risk\nthe agriculture sector and build the resilience of the food and\nnutrition security sector by minimising the vulnerability of farmers.\nProjects and programmes targeting adaptation and resilience\nbuilding in the food and nutrition security-related sectors have\nbeen implemented. Examples include Kenya Climate Smart\nAgriculture Project (KCSAP); Kenya Cereals Enhancement\nProgramme–Climate Resilient Agricultural Livelihoods Window\n(KCEP-CRAL), Towards Ending Drought Emergencies: Ecosystem\nbased Adaptation in Kenya’s Arid and Semi-arid Rangelands\n(TWENDE), and National Agricultural Rural Inclusive Growth\nProject (NARIGP).\nThe KCSAP was a Government of Kenya project supported by the\ngovernment and through a World Bank concessional loan and is\nan example of intervention with climate adaptation outcomes\nfor food and nutrition security. KCSAP was implemented over a\nfive-year period (2017- 2023) with key actions including improving\ncrop productivity through implementation of CSA interventions,\nincreasing crop productivity through improved irrigation, improving\nproductivity in the livestock and fisheries sectors through\nimplementation of CSA interventions, and diversification of\nlivelihoods to adjust to a changing climate. Some key results from\nthe project included farmers and livestock keepers accessing\nclimate-oriented insurance, significant reductions in pre- and\npost-harvest losses, and rehabilitated rangelands.93\n58\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nIn summary, the following progress has been achieved on\nprioritised Adaptation Actions for the food and nutrition security\npriority area:\n\t•\nTo improve crop productivity through implementation of\nCSA interventions, around 200,000 actors in the agriculture\nsector are now harvesting and storing water for irrigation.\nSimilarly, the area under irrigation in Kenya has increased\nby over 5,000 Hectares.\n\t•\nThe annual ASALs water harvesting and storage capacity\nimproved by 1,130,000 M3 from the 38 water pans, 6\nsubsurface dams constructed and 73 bore holes and\nshallow wells in 11 ASAL counties.94\n\t•\nClose to 400,000 farmers have access to climate-oriented\ncrop insurance. Likewise, the number of farmers accessing\nclimate-oriented livestock insurance increased marginally\nas new farmer households insured over 90,000 cattle by\nthe end of 2022. Similar to the crop and livestock subsectors, over 40,000 fishers adopted Insurance products\nfor the fisheries sub-sector.\n\t•\nThere has also been increased uptake of fish farming\ncages, as a fish production alternative to traditional fishing.\n\t•\nUnder enabling actions, including technology and knowledge\nmanagement, over 15 counties in Kenya now have Climate\nInformation Service plans to guide climate information\nprovision for adaptation purposes.\n\t•\nThree counties (Kwale, Narok and Siaya) have developed\nIntegrated Climate Risk Management Plans; more counties\nare conducting participatory climate risk assessments as\npart of their adaptation planning processes.\n\t•\nThe government has also supported close to 300,000\nnew households in Kenya to adopt diversified adaptive\n94 Government of Kenya.

To date\nthey have reached 16,000 farmers\n3.\nWater and the Blue Economy\nKenya has been described as a water scarce country with per\ncapita water availability of 647 m3 against the global standard of\n1,000 m3. Climate change continues to exacerbate the decline in\naccess to good quality water for domestic and productive uses.\nClimate change related fluctuations in rainfall have affected the\nwater supply negatively impacting agriculture, hydroelectric energy\nproduction, and sanitation. The Ministry of Water, Sanitation and\nIrrigation through its sector institutions is implementing various\nwater harvesting projects in the country with a view of increasing\nstorage and making the country water secure.\nVarious actions have been implemented in Kenya to support\nadaptation and resilience in the water and blue economy priority\narea. Some of these are summarised below:\nThe Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Project\n(KIWASH, 2015-2020) supported by the United States Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID) was designed to accelerate\nand sustain improvements in water and sanitation access.\nKIWASH enabled nearly 900,000 Kenyans across nine counties to\ngain access to improved water security, sanitation, and hygiene\nservices and assisted households in gaining access to irrigation\nand nutrition services. Additionally, KIWASH contributed to\nthe quality of community water sources through catchment\nconservation and environmental awareness. The project supported\nsector institutions and 24 Water Resource Users Association to\nunderstand and plan for climate change risks and to date, has\nprotected 68 springs and planted over 200,000 indigenous trees.99\nOver 55 hydrogeological surveys were undertaken across several\ncounties in Kenya as efforts towards sustainable ground water\nabstraction. For example, the identification and mapping of\nlocations for artificial ground water recharge to increase water\nsupply took place in the Athi Basin. These actions helped to\nreduce food risks by identifying areas for managed aquifer\nrecharge to utilize storm water.\nThe Kenya Water Towers Agency, which is concerned with\nconservation, rehabilitation, and sustainable management of water\ntowers, has initiated a number of adaptation initiatives mostly\naimed at providing alternative sources of income and livelihoods\nto communities neighbouring the water towers. Examples of such\ninitiatives include the establishment of Community-Based Tree\nand Bamboo Nurseries to help raise tree and bamboo seedlings\nto support in the rehabilitation of degraded areas in the water\n59\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\ntowers, bee keeping initiatives to provide alternative community\nlivelihoods to water tower-dependent communities. 100\nTo increase water harvesting and water storage infrastructure,\nover 600 boreholes have been constructed to tap into groundwater\nresources in response to increased water scarcity resulting mainly\nfrom drought in the most vulnerable counties. Additionally, over\n143 earth dams/pans were constructed, and 23 water supply\nschemes completed/rehabilitated. Thousands of water tanks\nhave been installed in institutions, mainly schools, for rainwater\nharvesting and storage mostly in arid counties that have made\nsignificant investments in the water sector. Rainwater harvesting\nreduces water wastage and environmental degradation by\nstorm water.\nDe-siltation of existing dams, extending water pipelines, and\nprotecting water catchment areas and sources such as springs\nenhanced the availability of safe water and reduced distances\ntravelled to access water. For example, Nyamira County reduced\nthe distance of rural accessibility to water from 3 km to 1.3 km.\nIn the coast of Kenya, over 600 Ha of mangrove forests were\neither planted or rehabilitated to protect the coastline and sustain\n100 Government of Kenya.

The National Environment\nManagement Authority (NEMA) through the Adaptation Fund\nproject distributed 171,045 mangroves seedlings which were\nplanted in both Gazi and Vanga mangrove ecosystems and\nsupported rehabilitation of 2 acres of corals in Wasini.\nThe Coastal Oceans Research and Development in the Indian\nOcean-East Africa (CORDIO–EA) initiated identification and\ndescription of locally-relevant climate smart practices in marine\ncommunity-based natural resources management (CBNRM)\nprogrammes. This area-based protection included, for example,\ncommunity no-take zones and fishing gear restrictions (mesh\nsize); these have been identified as approaches used in fisheries\nmanagement that also double up as climate smart practices.\nAwareness and sensitization programmes on water use efficiency\ncontinued to be implemented across counties for the purpose of\nenhancing water harvesting and conservation. Regular inspection\nof water quality in Nyeri and Kericho counties led to a reduction\nin waterborne diseases in communities.\n4.\nForestry, Wildlife and Tourism\nClimate change is likely to affect the growth and development of\ntree species, leading to reduced biodiversity and capacity to deliver\nimportant ecosystem goods and services that are necessary\nfor livelihood resilience and climate adaptation. Climate change\nis also expected to shift wildlife species distribution, reduce\npopulation size, and lead to the extinction of some species.\nSome key actions that have been implemented in this priority\narea are highlighted below:\n\t•\nKenya has increased forest cover from 6.99 % in 2010 to\n8.83 % in 2021, equivalent to 5,226,191.79 Ha of forested\narea and increased tree cover to 12.13%.\n\t•\nThe Kenya Forestry Research Institute and the Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency implemented an\nadaptation project between 2012-2017 that aimed to\nestablish a production system of seedlings of indigenous\ntree species that would be drought-tolerant and suited\nto the drylands of Kenya. The project coverage was\napproximately 52.4 ha. The purpose of this project was to\ndevelop drought-tolerant native species, Melia volkensii and\nAcacia tortilis in particular, to contribute to the promotion\nof productive forestation for various uses. The project\nactivities assisted with the establishment of two clonal\nseed orchards of Melia volkensii in Kitui and Kibwezi. Seed\nproduction from these two orchards produced 4,900 kg\nof fruit in 2016.\n\t•\nThe World Agroforestry Centre established the Kenya\nRangelands Ecosystem Services Productivity Programme\nto improve the livelihoods of communities and their\nlandscapes by enhancing the productivity of ecosystem\nservices provided by rangelands for food, feed, and\nhuman and wildlife security in Laikipia, Samburu, Isiolo,\nand Baringo. The key activities included: characterisation\nand inventory of existing types of perennials, their uses\nas well as existing tree nurseries; establishing community\ntree nurseries to enable the production of multipurpose\ntree seedlings for planting by individuals, farmers, and\nlocal communities; promoting tree-based investments\n(such as aloe plants, honey, animal hides, dairy, and fruit\ntrees like mangoes) and enterprises in agroforestry for\npasture/feed and food security\n\t•\nThe Kenya Rangelands Ecosystem Services Productivity\nProgramme is also applying findings from rangelands\nhealth mapping to identify suitable interventions and\nengage beneficiaries in implementing agroforestry for\nclimate mitigation and adaptation; design and installation\nof rain and floodwater harvesting systems for growing trees\nand improving pasture on croplands and rangelands, and\nmobilisation of local stakeholders to rehabilitate degraded\ndryland forests. The key achievements included maps\nshowing the terrain, land use, soils, tree cover, and climate.101\n\t•\nTo combat the devastating impacts of climate change in\nKenya, the President launched a 15-billion tree campaign in\n2022 which also marked the unveiling of the Green Army,\nan initiative that is engaging the youth in tree growing and\nenvironmental conservation.\n\t•\nThe Kenya Forest Service led rehabilitation and restoration\nof degraded natural forests was done through; enrichment\nplanting of 19,600 Ha of degraded sites within the gazetted\nforest reserves of Aberdares, Mau, Cherengany, Mt. Elgon,\nMt. Kenya and Mangroves areas at the Coast; temporary\nfencing of 1000 Ha of degraded forests and use of 120\ncommunity scouts to enhance natural regeneration.\n\t•\nSimilarly, 61,146 Ha of rangeland have been rehabilitated\nfrom Opuntia spp invasive species using biological control\nand 60 acres rehabilitated from Leleshwa (Tarchonanthus\ncamphoratus)\n\t•\nThe Kenya Forest Service developed and deployed the\n‘Jaza Miti App’, a species - site matching tool to enhance\ntree growing and enable achievement of the 30% tree\ncover by 2032.\n\t•\nOver 214 km of firebreaks constructed in Aberdares, Lake\nNakuru and Tsavo West National Park.\n60\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n\t•\nSupported the establishment of 52,962 hectares of\nagroforestry through supply of seedlings and technical\nadvice to farmers to enhance the provision of food,\nfodder, and fuel wood and livelihood improvement for\nrural communities in the country\n\t•\nKenya’s tourism industry is largely based on her diverse and\nattractive wildlife. But the wildlife is faced with numerous\nchallenges including climate-related impacts such as drought\nthat has killed a significant number of animals and the\nincreased incidences of wildfires; human wildlife conflict\ndue to encroachment in conservation areas and wildlife\nmigratory corridors; and invasive species, among others.\nOver 2,000 Ha of wildlife habitats have been conserved,\nso far out of an NCCAP target of 30,000 Ha. Around 80%\nof wildlife dispersal areas and migratory pathways have\nalso been secured.\n\t•\nA National Wildlife Climate Change Adaptation Strategy\n2022-2032 has been developed to guide holistic adaptation\nefforts within the sector and to ensure that the country’s\nwildlife is sustainably managed in the face of climate\nchange and continues to support the tourism sector which\nemploys a significant number of people and is a leading\nforeign exchange earner for the country.102\n102 Wildlife Research and Training Institute.

Climate actions in the health sector is\nprioritised in the current and past NCCAPs where an integrated\napproach to climate actions that address sustainable human\nsettlements and health and sanitation services. Actions identified\nin these priority areas scale up of malaria-control measures,\nmanaging other vector-borne diseases; improving planning and\ndevelopment of human settlements, for example by supporting\nformulation and implementation of urban spatial plans for ease\nof service delivery and healthy surroundings; and enforcement\nof climate smart/green cities and building codes and standards\nfor all urban infrastructure.\nThe following specific actions have been achieved so far:\n\t•\nTo better understand adaptation actions that can improve\nthe climate resilience of the health sector, the Kenya Red\nCross Society has conducted a national assessment of\nclimate change impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation for\nthe sector.103\n\t•\nNow Kenya has climate information included in its Integrated\nDisease Surveillance and Response system.\n\t•\nKenya has taken action to reduce the incidence of malaria\nand other vector-borne diseases that are impacted by\nclimate change.\n\t•\nUnder urbanisation and human settlements, Kenya\nhas prioritised implementation of the Building Climate\nResilience for the Urban Poor initiative with a view to\nbuilding resilience and enhancing adaptive capacity of\nthe urban poor population in cities, municipalities and\ntowns; the programme is progressing with collaboration\nof national government, county governments, private\nsector and other actors.\n\t•\nThe Building Climate Resilience for the Urban Poor\ninitiative focusses on delineating and profiling vulnerable\nurban areas; preparing climate-resilient plans; improving\nhuman settlements and climate proofing of infrastructure;\ndeveloping a green urban economy and livelihood strategies;\nand strengthening NDC urban dimensions.\n\t•\nCounty governments, particularly in ASALs have been\nputting in place building codes to promote resilience under\nWASH. For example, building plans in Makueni County\nrequire a water harvesting component, which contributes\nto increased water availability and reduces run-of together\nwith related impacts.\n\t•\nUnder this priority area, children’s participation is also\ntaken into consideration.

Measuring household vulnerability to climate-induced stresses in pastoral rangelands of Kenya:\nImplications for resilience programming. Pastoralism, 4(1): 1-15.\nThe focus of the manufacturing sector is reducing the impacts\nof climate change on manufacturing activities as well as creating\nnew economic and market opportunities through resource\nefficiency, sustainable production, and managing waste as\na resource in the creation of new product lines from waste\nrecovery and re-use. Overall, the manufacturing and trade sector\nare addressing adaptation through a variety of short-, medium-,\nand long-term strategies.\nSome of the actions implemented include the following:\n\t•\nCBIN-K is helping to build the private sector’s capacity to\ninvest in adaptation and assisting companies in identifying\nopportunities for climate-resilient products.\n\t•\nWater and resource efficiency, sustainable production, and\nwaste management are prioritised as climate adaptation\nprograms in the manufacturing sector.\n\t•\nThe Ethical Tea Partnership, through the Kenya Tea\nDevelopment Agency, supported 650,000 tea farmers to\nadopt CSA approaches. Over 40,000 farmers were trained\nat Farmer Field Schools on climate change impacts and\nagricultural practices to mitigate its effects. Farmers\nwere supported to plant over half a million drought- and\nfrost-resistant tea clones, which are more resilient to\nunpredictable weather patterns. Between 2016 and 2018,\nfarmers planted over 1 million trees and a further 2,500,000\nseedlings were being raised in tree nurseries.104\n\t•\nAs documented in the NCCAP 2nd implementation progress\nreport, Kenya Breweries developed a low-cost beer made\nfrom sorghum. This has created new market opportunities\nfor the brewer as well supported over 47,000 farmers\nfrom marginal areas to transition from subsistence to\nsustainable commercial farming.105\n7.\nEnergy and Transport\nThe energy and transport sectors have been particularly vulnerable\nto the impacts of climate change, notably drought and flooding.\nThis often leads to losses and damages that have informed the\nclimate proofing of energy and transport infrastructure. The focus\nof adaptation actions in the energy sector includes the following:\n\t•\nOptimising existing hydropower plants, improving water\nmanagement, and conservation and rehabilitation catchment\nareas feeding the dams. For example, Kenya Electricity\nGeneration (KenGen) has worked to increase the climate\nresilience of its hydropower operations by increasing the\nnumber of turbines and the storage capacity of dams.\n\t•\nThe Kenyan government has also been supporting the rollout of off-grid renewable energy technologies to ensure\nenergy is climate smart and used productively\n\t•\nIn the transport sector, the focus is on the establishment\nof efficient, sustainable, world-class transport systems and\nlogistics services that withstand the projected impacts of\nclimate change.106\n\t•\nThe transport sector the Kenya Urban Roads Authority\nand the Kenya National Highways Authority recognise\nclimate change as a risk and at the subsector level and\nconsiderations for climate risk management are incorporated\nduring planning and implementation of new projects.\n\t•\nKPLC concrete pole usage stands at 22,516 which is a\n20.5% of the total pole; replacement of wooden poles\nongoing at the 132 kV Rabai - Kilifi transmission line.\n\t•\nThe Energy sector rehabilitated 2,500 Ha of forest that\nserves the hydro dams in the country, hence protecting\nthe area feeding the dams, as the sector benefits from\nforestry related eco-benefits\n\t•\nClimate risk and vulnerability assessments are implicit in\nthe Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)\nstudies for proposed projects.

Women have increased\nvulnerability to many impacts of climate change due to their\nlower incomes, less access to credit, limited decision-making\nauthority, and limited control over resources.107 For example, the\nvulnerability level of households in pastoral rangelands is largely\ndetermined by the gender and education level of the household\nhead.108 Women-headed households have been observed to be\nhighly vulnerable to climate change due to lack of ownership and\ncontrol over productive assets. The role of women as primary\ncaregivers and providers of food and fuel makes them more\nvulnerable in the occurrence of hazards such as flooding and\ndroughts, which are now common.\nFactors such as social status, gender, poverty level, livelihood\noptions, and access to and control of resources influence\nvulnerability and how different people experience climate\nchange. For women, their vulnerability is reinforced by the\nexisting gender inequalities they face across social, economic,\npolitical, and environmental systems, and in turn, this means\nthat women are more likely to be disproportionately affected by\n62\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nclimate change.109 Women’s dependence on natural resources\nfor both reproductive and productive activities underscore\ntheir vulnerability in the face of increased climatic uncertainty.\nKenya’s climate risk profile reveals that the impacts of climate\nchange on women are particularly acute in the agriculture and\nwater sectors where they play significant roles.110 For example,\nwomen comprise 75 % of the agricultural labour force in Kenya\nwhile across many communities, they are responsible for various\ndomestic outdoor chores e.g., fetching water. During drought,\nthey spend many hours and trek long distances to obtain water\nfor domestic use; while during floods, they spend a significant\namount of time searching for firewood. With such levels of\nvulnerability, instances have been reported where women have\nresorted to negative coping mechanisms because of hunger.111\nChildren and youth under 35 years of age, who constitute over\n75% of the Kenyan population, are the other group particularly\nvulnerable to climate change hazards such as droughts, floods,\nand heat stress. Compared to adults, children are less likely to\nwithstand and survive climate-related shocks; are susceptible to\nassociated nutrition deficits; and are more likely to be affected\nby climate-sensitive diseases. Those with disability or facing\ndisplacement often experience additional challenges during\nextreme weather events.[57] The 2023 short rains assessment\nreport found high malnutrition levels among children aged 6\nto 59 months across ASALs due to the cumulative effects of\nprevious five failed rain seasons, poor child feeding habits, and\nhigh disease burden.112\nWomen and other vulnerable groups (including orphans, persons\nliving with disabilities, the aged, widows, widowers, internally\nand externally displaced persons, marginalised persons, and\npastoralists living in ASALs) are particularly vulnerable to a\nchanging climate and often have the least access to and control\nof resources (such as capital, credit, and land). Some vulnerable\ngroups live in areas exposed to climatic hazards and risks (such\nas arid lands and urban poor areas) and are less able to cope\nwith climate shocks and stresses.\nThe following progress has been made on priority adaptation\nactions and opportunities for GESI:\n\t•\nStrengthening the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups:\n\n Indigenous knowledge has been incorporated in\nresearch-based innovations for livelihoods support\namong vulnerable populations facing negative impacts\nof climate change\n\n Through capacity building, the Regional Development\nAuthorities encourage farmers to form farmers\n109 undp-ndcsp-kenya-gender-analysis-report.pdf\n110 World Bank Group.

(2020). Updated NDC.\nKenya requires sustained investment in adaptation and resilience\nbuilding going forward. Adequate and sustained finance is\nneeded to allow for successful and best practices to be taken\nto scale. As per the updated NDC of 2020, the total cost of\nimplementing the adaptation actions up to the year 2030 is\nestimated at USD 44 billion.117 Out of this, Kenya’s expects to\nmobilise approximately 13% from domestic sources while the\nbalance requires international support. Climate finance provided\nin form of loans will be treated as domestic contributions.\nAlthough Kenya has made progress to access international\nclimate finance for adaptation, financing remains inadequate\nand unpredictable due to a number of challenges including\ncomplex and demanding climate finance access requirements\nand procedures; mitigation-centric international climate finance\nflows; and substituting Official Development Assistance (ODA)\nfor adaptation finance. To facilitate adaptation finance access,\nKenya is already implementing readiness actions towards\nenhancing mobilisation of predictable financial resources, such\nas through the FLLoCA program which supports counties with\nclimate finance readiness. Other efforts include an enabling\npolicy and legislative environment, and development of the\nGreen Fiscal Incentives Policy Framework.[72]\nAdditionally, apart from the financial needs required for the\nimplementation of priority adaptation actions, financial support\nis required for Kenya’s NAP process. This includes updating\nthe NCCAP and NAP, undertaking climate risk and vulnerability\nassessments, coordinating adaptation action including stakeholder\nengagement and other related activities. The NCCAP 2023-2027\nnoted that the CCD requires approximately KES 500 million (about\nUSD 3.8 million) annually to carry out its duties and functions\nto ensure effective coordination and delivery of NCCAP 20232027; previous NCCAPs have had huge gaps in financing for\nadaptation action.\nSome specific financial needs are highlighted below:\n\t•\nUnder the Disaster Risk Management priority area, the need\nfor enhanced support for early warning and early/ timely\nresponse to climate risks requires financial resources to\nexpand early warning systems to other counties especially\nin non-ASAL parts. Financial support should be predictable\nfor consistent climate action – current funding is focused\non projects and short-term funding.\n\t•\nFor food and nutrition security, financial support is required\nto scale breeding and the use of improved agricultural\ninputs such as drought resistant livestock breeds and\ncrop/feed varieties as well as to de-risk investments in\nthe agriculture sector, for example, through tailored crop\nand index-based livestock insurance. There is also a gap in\nfinancing to downscale climate information services and\nearly warning systems which have been identified as vital\nfor climate-smart agriculture and assisting effectiveness\nof crop and livestock insurance as well as disaster risk\nreduction for the agriculture sector. Another area with\nsignificant funding gaps is research and development\nspecifically tailormade research in livestock breeding,\ngenetics, livestock diseases and feeds and feeding to\nguide on genotype environment matching. Similarly, the\ncountry is unable to commit sufficient financial resources\nto revitalize agricultural extension services.\n\t•\nUnder water, fisheries and the blue economy, funding\nestimated at Ksh. 250 billion is required to support climate\nresilient irrigation and water Infrastructure, and a similar\namount for climate resilience building through, water supply\nand sanitation, Infrastructure estimated at Ksh 250 billion.\n\t•\nThe forestry sector is in need of financial resources to\ndevelop an MEL system for adaptation monitoring and\nevaluation, which remains a key gap.\n\t•\nFor the Tourism sector, financing for implementation of\nThe Reviewed Strategic Plan for Tourism and Wildlife\n2023-2027 which integrates adaptation of climate change\nin the sector.\n2.\nTechnology Development and Transfer Needs\nKenya carried out technology needs assessments in 2005\nand 2015. The findings identified environmentally sustainable\ntechnologies such as solar dryers, drought tolerant crops, water\nharvesting, and efficient irrigation technologies.\nKenya is well-placed to build on its success with M-Pesa and other\nmobile money applications to improve farmers’ access to credit\nfor procuring adaptation technologies, to improve access to CIS,\nand to improve access to training. Kenya welcomes support to\nexplore expanding this learning on mobile applications to other\nsectors and products.\nKenya has deployed adaptation technologies with some degree\nof success, but the rate and scale of adoption remains low due\nto a number of challenges including limited awareness, high cost\nof interventions, low investment, and inadequate installation\nand maintenance. Other challenges include weak policies and\nstandards. Support is therefore required to support awareness,\nand development of and adapting the needed technologies to\nthe local context. This will require continued capacity building\nfor and engagement of the private sector.\nTechnology transfer needs for different priority sectors are\nsummarised below:\nFor disaster risk management, there is need for Limited Predictive\nModelling and Analysis Tools. While advancements have been\nmade, predictive models still struggle with accurately forecasting\ndroughts due to their complex nature. This is particularly true\nfor multi-year or prolonged droughts, where factors like climate\nvariability (e.g., El Niño) add complexity.\nThere is a need to create capacity for domestic earth observation\ndata management for drought/climate early warning, to\ncomplement and eventually replace external open-source\nsystems and data sources.\nUnder food and nutrition security, there is increasing need for\ndevelopment or adoption of digital applications to support\n64\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nactions in the value chains that enhance climate adaptation and\nresilience by contributing to Climate Smart Agriculture.\nAs climate change impacts the oceans through warming and\nother changes like sea level rise, the water and blue economy\nsector is in need of oceanographic and environmental monitoring\ntechnologies needed to monitor the health of Marine ecosystems\nand related resources for appropriate adaptive response.\nUnder forestry, adoption of the ‘JAZA MITI APP’ on monitoring\nthe progress of the planted trees was a great innovative idea\nwhich requires further scale up, particularly to local levels where\ncommunities and climate planning structure at the Ward levels\ncan put it into use. The sector is also in need of development\nof technologies on dryland tree species, efficient utilization of\nwood and non- wood forest products to reduce pressure on\nforest ecosystems and enhance their adaptive capacity.\nFor Manufacturing, Energy and Transport, there needs to be\nestablishment of real-time, automated, and integrated early\nwarning systems for climate-related hazards that cater to\nindustrial operations, energy infrastructure, and transport systems.\nDeployment of advanced energy storage systems to enhance\ngrid flexibility and support renewable energy integration is also\nseen as a gap in the energy sector which hampers the role of\nrenewable energy in supporting adaptation.\nPromotion of affordable climate-smart and energy-efficient\ntechnologies for industries and decentralized renewable energy\nstorage at the household, community levels and national levels\nUnder manufacturing, there is a gap in access to technology\nfor equipment design, prototyping and fabrication to serve the\ngrowing market and encourage local production with locally\navailable suitable substitutes for machine parts for cost effective\ndesigns and reconditioning to fit purpose.\n3.\nCapacity Building Needs\nWhile key institutions and the related arrangements that support\nclimate adaptation activities have been established, capacity\ndevelopment is still essential for these institutions as well as\nother relevant public and non-state actor institutions to deliver\non adaptation actions. Towards this end, a critical mass of\nknowledge and lessons on climate risks and vulnerabilities is\nbeing accumulated through several initiatives. These include\nthe Kenya County Climate Risk Profiles prepared for 45 counties\nby the by Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Cooperatives (MALF&C) with support of the International Center\nfor Tropical Agriculture and the CGIAR Research Programme on\nClimate Change, Agriculture and Food Security; the Climate Risk\nProfile Kenya prepared by the World Bank in 2021; assessment of\nclimate change impacts on health by the Kenya Red Cross, 2021;\nKenya Climate Smart Agriculture Programme (KCSAP) and the\nevaluation and monitoring process of the CSA Multistakeholder\nPlatform; and assessments at different levels undertaken by\nacademia and research institutions.\nKenya has created a publicly accessible National Climate\nChange Resource Centre (NCCRC) that includes a robust and\nup-to-date climate change knowledge management system, and\nan updated climate change information portal with platforms\nfor children, the youth, women, and marginalised and minority\ncommunities. The business plan for NCCRC was in place by\nthe end of 2020 and the resource centre became operational in\n20XX and was refitted in 20XX to enable access for persons with\ndisabilities. Support is needed for continued capacity building\nfor the individuals from national and county governments, CSOs,\nand the private sector that are engaged on adaptation planning\nand especially implementation of actions on the ground. Areas\nfor capacity development include:\n\t•\nBuilding capacities of climate change sector coordinating\nunits at national and county levels on climate risk and\nvulnerability assessments, adaptation planning, and\nreporting.\n\t•\nBuilding local capacity to implement adaptation actions\nand programmes, to reduce reliance on international\norganisations and consultants and enable local entities\n(government and non-government) to access climate\nfinance and lead the implementation of adaptation projects\nand programmes.\n\t•\nEstablishing or strengthening monitoring, evaluation, and\nlearning systems to support the tracking of progress on\nadaptation action at national and county levels, to improve\nunderstanding of the impacts of adaptation actions, and\nto improve the sharing and communication of learning\non adaptation.\n\t•\nStrengthening the capacity of relevant institutions to map,\ncollect, and collate gender disaggregated information to\ninform the design and implementation of adaptation actions.\n\t•\nThere is a need for enhanced capacity for multi-channel\ndissemination and multi-dialect translations of climate\ninformation, adaptation plans and other key components\nfor disaster risk reduction and adaptive capacity including\naccessibility to PWD.\n\t•\nFor effective disaster risk management, there is need\nto expand capacity for production and dissemination of\nmonthly drought early warning bulletins for the traditionally\nnon-ASAL counties scaling up from the current 23 ASAL\ncounties to reach the other 24 counties in the country.\n\t•\nThere is need to build the capacity for sharing lessons\nbetween counties towards scaling the development and\nroll out of tailored early warning systems e.g., monthly\nnational drought early warning bulletins (ASALs).\n\t•\nThere is also great need to strengthen the capacity of\nextension services along the value chains for food and\nnutrition security, particularly for support to climate-smart\nagriculture in the face of intensifying risks. This would\ngo hand in hand or contribute to the need to introduce\ncapacity building programs for communities on climatesmart agricultural practices.\n\t•\nConducting capacity building in indigenous knowledge,\nlivestock insurance schemes, early warning systems,\nlivestock management and breeding have all also been\nidentified as key for adaptive capacity in the agriculture\nsector.\n\t•\nFor enhanced capacity on adaptation, there needs to be\nestablished a climate change unit in the State Department\nfor Tourism.\n\t•\nIn the Manufacturing sector, capacity development is\nrequired on project concept development to integrate\nadaptation needs as a way to unlock adaptation financing.\nThe same is critical for the energy and transport sectors\nwere participatory climate risk assessment for proposed\nprojects in now an important need considering the impact\nof climate-related hazards in those sectors.\n\t•\nThe awareness and capacity of communities to participate\nin climate risk assessments and decision-making processes\n65\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nin industries, energy, and transport projects needs to be\nenhanced.\n118 MoEF/CCD.

Ministry of Environment\nand Forestry, Nairobi, Kenya.\n3.6.4.\nMonitoring and Evaluation of adaptation actions and processes\nMonitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) of adaptation is\nnecessary to demonstrate that the benefits of adaptation\ninterventions are being realised and that lessons learnt are\nassisting in the improvement of sector adaptation plans and\nprogrammes. The Climate Change Act 2016 provides for the\ncoordination of Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV)\nprocesses by the CCD. NCCAP 2013–2017 provided a National\nPerformance and Benefit Measurement Framework (NPBMF).\nThe NPBMF was intended to be an integrated framework for\nMRV of mitigation action and monitoring and evaluating of\nadaptation actions, reporting on the synergies between them,\nand tracking support provided to undertake the actions. The\nsystem is also referred to as MRV+. Aspects of the system\nhave been operationalised, including actions related to the\nMEL system for adaptation. The CCD prepared two reports on\nprogress on the implementation of NCCAP 2018–2022, and an\nevaluation of the progress of implementation of the NAP in the\nagriculture sector.118\nAccording to the report on the implementation of NCCAP\n2018–2022, the adaptation M&E system was supposed to be\nfully functional by June 2023, setting out institutional structures\nand role of stakeholders in reporting; similarly, a climate registry\nfor adaptation actions was supposed to be established with\ninformation publicly available. These actions have been slow\nin implementation based on capacity needs issues addressed\nin section 5.3. However, a short-list of county level adaptation\nindicators has been identified as part of the current NCCAP\n2023 – 2027.119\n3.6.5.\nCooperation good practices, experience and lessons learned\nEfforts to share information, good practices, experience and lessons learned:\n\t•\nScience, planning and policies relevant to adaptation: Joint\ninitiatives/ partnerships in adaptation science, planning\nand policy development have been implemented over the\npast years of adaptation implementation including:\n\n The Adaptation Consortium brought together local\norganizations and international organizations working\nwith county governments, NDMA and the Kenya\nMeteorological Department to make use of Climate\nInformation Services to inform adaptation planning\nand financing through the County Climate Change\nFund Mechanisms (CCCF).\n\n Multistakeholder platforms have been established\nto champion dissemination of climate adaptation\ngood practices. An example is the Agriculture (Food\nand Nutrition Security) sector where there has been\ndocumentation and sharing of experiences and lessons\nlearned in Climate Smart Agriculture MSP.\n\n Policy innovation and pilot and demonstration project:\nThe Kenya Cereals Enhancement Programme (KCEP)–\nClimate Resilient Agricultural Livelihoods (CRAL)\nWindow (KCEP-CRAL), a strategic Government of\nKenya (GoK) partnership with European Union (EU)\nand International Fund for Agricultural Development\n(IFAD), Food Agricultural Organization (FAO), and World\nFood Programme (WFP) focused on the three leading\nrain-fed cereals (maize, sorghum and millet) and pulses\n(beans, cowpeas, green grams and pigeon peas) that\naccount for 95% of the land under food crop production\nand 70% the value of food crops produced annually.\nBased on this programme, jointly implemented by these\nactors, some good practices were developed e.g. soil\nfertility management curriculum and training materials\ndeveloped on the 3 crops that can be replicated in\nother crops. The experience demonstrated that a more\nholistic programme/project design that addresses\ncross-sectoral adaptation needs is more impactful\n\t•\nCooperation to share information and to strengthen science,\ninstitutions and adaptation: The ICPAC GHACOF and KMD\nMulti- stakeholder seasonal outlook forum is an example\nof cooperation for sharing of best available science for\nadaptation based on the good practice of structured\ndownscaling and dissemination of weather and climate\ninformation accompanied with sector-specific advisories.\nOne important lesson from this collaboration is that coproduction of weather and climate information together\nwith sector specific advisories makes the information\nrelevant, acceptable and understandable. Production and\ndissemination of early warning information with sufficient\nlead time saves lives and livelihoods.\n\t•\nImproving durability and effectiveness of adaptation\nactions: The County Climate Fund Mechanism (CCCF)\npiloting and its scale up through FLoCCA programme has\nprovided a key framework and lessons on implementation\nof climate action through key local level multi-stakeholder\npartnerships that prioritise important grassroot structures\nand actors, particularly communities. Establishment of\nan enabling legal, policy and institutional framework on\nwhich adaptation actions are anchored both at the national\nand sub-national levels is a notable good practice that\nis now replicated across all the 47 Counties in Kenya. A\nmulti-stakeholder collaboration involving both government\nand non-state actors working within existing governance\nstructures at both national and sub-national levels armed\nwith enabling policy environment is key for achievement\nof adaptation at scale.\n66\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nStrengthening scientific research and knowledge related to adaptation:\n120 National Environment Management Authority (2015).

Information related to averting, minimizing and\naddressing loss and damage associated with climate\nchange impacts\n3.7.1.\nObserved and potential climate change impacts, including those\nrelated to extreme weather events and slow onset events, drawing\nupon the best available science.\nHeavy rains, floods, droughts, soil erosion, and sea level rise\nput both urban and rural infrastructure at risk, particularly\nfor poor and vulnerable groups. Environmental degradation,\naltered water resources, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem\nservices constitute serious obstacles to the country’s continued\ndevelopment, of particular relevance to the country’s tourism\nsector. In addition, rising temperatures will have a negative\nimpact on key parts of the economy, e.g. forestry, agriculture,\nand livestock. Changes in precipitation patterns can have farreaching consequences for ecosystems and biodiversity, food\nproduction, the water industry and rivers.120\nThe majority of Kenyan agriculture relies on seasonal rains for\nproduction and the projected changes in precipitation patterns\nare expected to directly increase the likelihood of short-term crop\nfailures and long-term production declines. Rain-fed agriculture\nremains the dominant source of staple food production and is\nthe foundation of livelihoods for the majority of the rural poor\nin Kenya. The high inter-annual variability of precipitation is\nalready having devastating consequences on rural livelihoods,\nwith droughts and floods a frequent occurrence in both the arid\nand semi-arid lands and key agricultural zones.\n67\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n3.7.2.\nActivities related to averting, minimizing and addressing loss and\ndamage associated with the adverse effects of climate change\n121 Government of Kenya. (2023).\nLoss and damage refer to impacts of climate change that are\nunavoidable by adaptation, mitigation, and other strategies like\ndisaster risk reduction. It is focused on long-term, irreversible\nlosses, like the loss of life and means of subsistence, biodiversity,\nculture, etc. Loss and damage addresses effects that adaptation\nalone is unable to sufficiently address as a policy response.\nUnder the UNFCCC, loss and damage is categorised as the\nremaining costs that cannot be avoided even with adaptation\nand mitigation and can be further divided into economic loss and\nnon-economic loss. These more specifically refer to the negative\nconsequences of the unavoidable risks of climate change, like\nrising sea levels, prolonged heat waves, desertification, and\nextreme events, such as bushfires, species extinction and crop\nfailures.121 These have all been observed in Kenya and as the\nclimate change progresses these events more frequent and\ntheir consequences will become more severe considering the\nhigh levels of vulnerability in the country.\nA brief overview analysing the nature of Loss and Damage in\nKenya highlights that the country has experienced various natural\nhazards that have resulted in huge losses and caused serious\ndamage to the existing infrastructure, lives and livelihoods.\nEconomic losses attributed to climate change impacts are\nestimated to be between 3% – 5% of the GDP per year with\nprojections indicating it may rise to about 9% of the GDP per\nyear in 2050. Table 3.16 summarises some activities being\nimplemented across some sectors in Kenya that may help avert,\nminimise or generally address loss and damage:\nTable 3-16:\n Loss and Damage per Priority Sector in Kenya\nSector\nLoss & Damage\nDisaster Risk Management\nWater levels of lakes in Kenya’s Great Rift Valley increased significantly, hurting local communities\nand ecosystems. Losses and damages associated with the rising water levels in Kenyan lakes\ninclude submerging of land resulting in losses, damage to properties and businesses/livelihoods,\nand displacement of households.\nSeveral sectors were affected by floods resulting from the March - April – May (MAM) rainfalls of\n2024. Overall, 35 counties were affected, 315 people died, 188 people injured,35 people missing,\n58,641 Households displaced, 412,763 people affected, 291 Internally displacement camps (IDP)\nwere created, over 10, 131 people were rescued.\nPreliminary livestock mortality estimates of 2.6 million deaths of assorted livestock was recorded\nat the peak of the 2021 – 2023 drought. During this period, the drought response consumed\nover KSh .70 billion (GoK KSh. 22 billion; Non-state Actors KSh. 48 billion), a significant diversion\nof resources that would be otherwise support development and resilience/preparedness\ninvestments.\nFor this sector, the total estimated recovery budget for the sector is Ksh. 1,697,140,000 with\nagriculture and livestock budgets amounting to Ksh. 525,140,000 and Ksh. 1,172,000,000\nrespectively.\nFood and Nutrition Security\nIn the livestock sub-sector, the poor rains, combined with the effects of the prolonged dry spell\nand drought due to climate change have affected rangeland and water availability for pastoralists,\nresulting in diminished forage and livestock deaths, reduced household incomes, and increased\nfood insecurity.\nRecent flooding event during the 2024 MAM long rains led to total of 9,637 livestock being washed\naway in thirteen (13) Counties. These included 5,856 poultry, 372 cattle, 2,480 goats, 524 sheep, 2\ndonkeys, 22 camels and 318 pigs.\nAn estimated 298,673 acres of agricultural land was heavily affected by floods in 26 Counties. Over\n52,707 households were directly affected by MAM 2024 Long Rains floods with an estimated loss\nof Ksh. 5,252,000,841 in agricultural investment.\nEnvironment (Ecosystems and\nBiodiversity)\nSubmerging of riparian vegetation due to water rise in Great Rift Valley lakes with dire impacts on\nthe existing fauna and flora.\nHealth, Sanitation and Human\nSettlements\nThe rising water levels of the Rift Valley lakes led to loss of lives and livelihoods, injury, outbreak of\ndiseases.\n During the 2024 MAM rains, sixty-eight (68) Health facilities were affected in twelve (12) counties\nby flooding, road closures, leaking roofs, destroyed pit latrines, and collapsed perimeter walls. The\nhealth sector infrastructure affected, and the recovery cost is estimated at Ksh. 8,435,000.\n68\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nSector\nLoss & Damage\nEnergy and Transport\nThe Kenyan railway network consists of 592 km Standard Gauge Railway (SGR)and 2,046 km\nMeter Gauge Railway (MGR). Both were adversely affected by flooding at various points in\n2023, including extensive erosion of embankments, cut slopes and culvert outlets. Total cost of\ndamage for MGR was KSh 1,297,908,422. Total cost of damage for SGR was estimated at Ksh\n851,347,200.\nA total of 799 road sections/links have been severely damaged by flooding in 2023. The estimated\ncost of the damage to roads network was Ksh 26,805,056,121.\nWildlife and Tourism\nChange in water levels rendered most parts of the Rift Valley lakes less aesthetic, hurting income\nfrom tourism.\nBursting of Telek river, Mara River and Sand River in recent 2024 flooding episodes caused\nsubmersion of hotels and lodges in Mara Game reserve while also destroying bridges connecting\nto settlement and tourist facilities. The flooding also affected 26 camps with minor destructions\nout of the over 150 camps in the Mara.\nActivities related to averting, minimizing and addressing loss & damage\n122 Decision 2/CMA.2 Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts and its 2019 review | UNFCCC\nThe loss and damage from rain-related flooding led to the\nformation of a National Floods Emergency Response Secretariat\nbased at the National Disaster Operation Centre (NDOC) which\nwas mandated to:\ni.\nDocument and report all flood disaster information from\nacross the country.\nii.\nProvide Early Warning information, flood alerts, flood\npreparedness, safety and emergency response information\nto stakeholders and the public.\niii. Mobilize resources and combine capacities at all levels\nof government to respond to crises.\nOther actions taken to address loss and damage include:\ni.\nModernization of the NDOC to enhance Early Warning\nSystems taking advantage of widespread access to\nICT and other technology that provides avenues for\ncollection, collation, processing and timely dissemination\nof information done by July 2023.\nii.\nStrengthened climate information dissemination by KMD.\nFor example, during the MAM rainfall in 2024, KMD issued\ndaily, weekly and monthly updates as well as 9 Flash\nMessages for emergency.

National circumstances, institutional arrangements\nand country-driven strategies\nNational Circumstances\nKenya is highly vulnerable to climate change largely due to the\nclimate-sensitive nature of its economy with the agriculture,\nwater, energy, tourism, and wildlife sectors being critical in\noverall economic output. Several environmental, physical,\neconomic and social factors contribute to Kenya’s high climate\nvulnerability. These include declining natural resources such\nas water, insecure land tenure, environmental degradation and\ninadequate environmental management actions, varying ecological\nzones with different exposure levels, inadequate social safety\nnets, increased social conflicts over increasingly limited natural\nresources like water and pasture during dry seasons and high\nreliance on natural and weather factors for productivity across\nvarious economic sectors. These are amplified further by socioeconomic factors such as high poverty levels, rapid population\ngrowth and fiscal constraints.\nClimate change significantly increases Kenya’s exposure to\nrisks resulting in multiple and evolving climate change needs.\nIn addition to adaptation and mitigation needs, Kenya faces loss\nand damage, and just transition needs. Impacts of response\nmeasures of developed countries are continually having a bearing\non Kenya’s economy.\nDrought and floods are the main climate hazards, negatively\nimpacting lives, livelihoods, economic output and human health\nincreasingly being at risk. Extreme climate events cause significant\nloss of life, adversely affecting the national economy. Sea level\nrise is already affecting coastal towns and communities and\nis expected to impact communities with coastal erosion and\nwetlands loss characterizing negative impacts in coastal areas.\nKenya requires USD 62 billion for mitigation and adaptation\nactions across sectors up to 2030. Kenya will mobilize resources\nto meet approximately 13% of this budget, requiring international\nsupport for the balance. The international support required is in\nthe form of finance, technology development and transfer, and\ncapacity building to fully realize her NDC. Kenya will consider\nany climate finance in terms of loans as part of its domestic\ncontribution.\n71\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nInstitutional arrangements\nThe Climate Change Act, 2016 established a robust institutional\nframework for Climate Change governance in Kenya. At the apex,\nthe Act established a National Climate Change Council chaired by\nthe President of the Republic of Kenya to provide an overarching\nnational climate change coordination mechanism and ensure\nthe mainstreaming of climate change functions by the national\nand county governments. The Climate Change Directorate is\nthe lead agency of the government on national climate change\nplans and actions to deliver operational coordination.\nThe National Climate Change Action Plans. which are periodically\nreviewed, serve as the strategic blueprint guiding Kenya’s mitigation\nand adaptation efforts, ensuring alignment with Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris agreement.\nEach state department and national government public entity\nis mandated to integrate the Climate Change Action Plans into\nsectoral strategies and action plans and report on sectoral\ngreenhouse gas emissions for the national inventory. County\ngovernments are equally mandated to integrate and mainstream\nclimate change actions into their planning processes, taking\ninto account national and county priorities. A County Executive\nCommittee Member appointed by the Governor coordinates\nclimate change affairs at the County level and is reporting for\nreporting on progress of implementation of climate change actions\nto the County Assembly and the Climate Change Directorate.\nFurther, the National Policy on Climate Finance (2018) and The\nNational Green Fiscal Incentives Policy provides clear direction on\nmechanisms for enhanced mobilization of climate finance from\nall sources. The Climate Finance and Green Economy Unit at the\nNational Treasury and Planning is responsible for coordinating\nclimate finance mobilization and reporting in the country.\nCountry-driven strategies\nKenya’s country driven approach is embedded within Kenya’s\nclimate change legal and policy frameworks that set national\nclimate change priorities identified through sectoral needs’\nassessments and stakeholder consultation processes. The\nframeworks designate sector level actions that require support\nand form the basis for to address climate change.\nThe country recognizes the importance of developing needsresponsive interventions that enhance adaptive capacities,\nbuild resilience to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions. In principle, all climate actions must be country\ndriven, and country owned, developed in a manner that is in\nline with national climate plans and priorities in consultation\nwith national and county governments’ institutional structures,\nand stakeholders.\nKenya underscores the crucial importance of means of\nimplementation in driving successful implementation of climate\naction in line with national commitments. The country explores and\nadopts technologies as well as requisite capacity strengthening\nefforts to facilitate effective delivery of impactful actions.\nExamples of these technologies include drought-resistant\ncrops and renewable energy solutions, access to which is\nfacilitated by collaboration with international partners. There are\nstill technological gaps across sectors and a need for further\ntechnology transfer to enable the full implementation of the\nNDC and a just transition\nKenya also undertakes capacity–building efforts which are equally\ncrucial for climate action. Training programs, technical assistance,\nand community engagement initiatives are designed to enhance\nthe adaptive capacity of local institutions and communities. These\nefforts ensure that climate actions are sustainable and locally\ndriven. However, capacity building initiatives often struggle with\ninadequate funding, lack of infrastructure, insufficient human\nresources and inadequately address institutional capacity gaps.\nFinancial resources are critical to Kenya’s adaptation and mitigation\nstrategies. The country has made significant strides in mobilizing\nclimate finance from both domestic and international sources.\nHowever, there remains a huge gap between finance needed\nand what is availed. This gap leads to delays and comprises the\neffectiveness of efforts to address climate change. Additionally,\nKenya....\n4.2. Underlying assumptions, definitions and\nmethodologies\nIn determining support received, Kenya makes the following:\nAssumptions\n1.\nOn-budget and off-budget support was considered\nin this BTR, acknowledging existing limitations in offbudget support tracking and data compilation that\nrequire more complex and detailed tracking practices\nto be developed over time. On-budget support refers to\nfinancial support received directly into Kenya’s budget from\ninternational sources. Off-budget refers to financial and\nin-kind (technological and technical assistance) resources\nreceived by the government through non-governmental\nchannels or offered directly to government agencies\nwithout direct financial input to the national budget.\n2.\nFollowing the explanation above, we assume that Kenya\nreceived the full sum of indicated amounts within the\nJanuary 2021 to December 2022 period into the national\nbudget.\n72\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nDefinitions and methodologies\n1.\nOnly core climate change support is considered as support\nreceived. In this BTR, Kenya considers support received\nfrom projects whose main(core) objective is climate\nchange mitigation and adaptation that are designated\nunder the NDC. Development projects with climate\nbenefits have not been considered due to challenges in\ndetermining additionality.\n2.\nThe BTR report only considers finance received and\nexpended (used) in contributing to the objectives of the\nNDC.\n3.\nIn principle, concessional loans received to support core\nclimate change projects shall count as Kenya’s climate\nfinance contribution. Kenya does not count market-rate\nloans (commercial loans) as climate finance.\n4.\nFinancial resources from the ex-chequer (internal budgetary\nallocation) are counted as Kenya’s own contribution.\n5.\nTo avoid double counting, this report has not considered\ninformation on support provided to Kenya based on the\nOECD/DAC data. This data will, however, be considered in\nfuture reports after Kenya develops an elaborate tracking\nsystem for climate finance.\n6.\nInformation on non-monetized climate support received\nhas not been included in the report. This is due to a lack\nof adequate information and data.\n7.\nThe average exchange rate for the dollar for the reporting\nperiod is Kshs. 109.\n4.3. Information on financial support needed\nKenya conducted a technical analysis of the resources required\nto meet the country’s NDCs’ targets. The technical analysis\nevaluated the national and sectoral policies, plans, and strategies\nincluding identified priority actions to inform data driven decisions\nbased on evidence and analytics. To complement the technical\nanalysis, data from available sectoral reports was assessed\nallowing for the extraction of meaningful insights to better\nunderstand Kenya’s priorities in scaling up climate action in\nmeeting our NDC targets.\nThe NDC targets cut across different sectors including disaster\nrisk reduction, agriculture (crops, livestock, and fisheries),\nenvironment, gender, youth, and other vulnerable groups, as\nwell as devolution.\nOverall, Kenya requires USD 62 billion until 2030 to support\nimplementation of NDC targets. Of this amount, mitigation\nactions for the period 2020-2030 require an estimated total\nof USD 17,725 million with designated sectoral financial totals\nas follows: Energy USD 8,890 million, Agriculture 250 million,\nTransport and infrastructure USD 4,240 million, LULUCF USD\n4126 million, and waste USD 39 million. Of the total mitigation\nfinance needed, Kenya intends to shoulder 21% (3,725 million\nUSD) from domestic sources subject to national circumstances,\nwhile the balance of USD 14,000 million (79%) is to be covered\nby international support. Adaptation remains a key priority for\nKenya. To meet its adaptation costs for the period 2020-2030,\nKenya requires an estimated USD 43,927 million. Subject to\nnational circumstances, Kenya intends to mobilize domestic\nresources to cater for 10% of the adaptation cost, while 90%\nof the adaptation cost, will require international support in the\nform of finance, technology development and transfer, and\ncapacity building\n4.4. Information on financial support received\nKenya has received a total of USD 508 Million in this BTR period.\nThis constitutes both on-budget and off-budget support. The\non-budget support accounts for 89% of the total sum, which is\nUSD 457 Million. USD 53 Million was delivered as grants, USD 365\nmillion was in loans. In line with Kenya’s NDC definition of climate\nfinance, the USD 365 million received as loans (both concessional\nand commercial) shall be counted towards Kenya’s contribution\nonce repayments are made. Off-budget support amounted to USD\n51 Million. This amount is not representative of the full support\nreceived during this period due to limitations in tracking various\nbilateral initiatives in Kenya. Kenya acknowledges the need to\ndesign and strengthen off-budget tracking mechanisms, and\nthe importance of international support towards this objective\nwithin the scope of availing support for reporting and building\nMonitoring, Reporting and Verification systems.\n4.5. Information on technology development and transfer\nsupport needed\nKenya’s technology development and transfer support needed is\nincluded in sectoral costs indicated in section 4.3 as estimated\nfinance needed to support technology development, and adoption.\nHowever, the methodology does not distinctly separate specific\nsupport needed for various technologies from the earmarked\npriority actions. Therefore, this BTR does not include specific\nfinance needed for technology development and transfer.\nKenya considers the development of a Technology Action Plan\nas an important intervention to assess the technological costs\nof various technologies identified in the NDC.\n73\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n4.6. Information on technology development and transfer\nsupport needed\nKenya has received technology-specific support through the\nKenya Industrial Research and Development Institute (KIRDI),\nthe National Designated Entity for the technology mechanism\nof the UNFCCC. The financial support received for the period\n2021 to 2022 for technology development and transfer is USD\n816,860.80. Details of the projects are provided in the Common\nTabular Format tables.\nInformation on capacity-building support needed\nThe support required for capacity-building initiatives during\nthis BTR period is included in the total support needed (USD 62\nbillion) as outlined in section 4.3. Specific costing of capacity\nbuilding needs across each NDC target sector was not available.\n4.7. Information on capacity-building support received\nKenya has received a total of USD 5.6 million towards capacitybuilding initiatives in this BTR period which was majorly from\nthe GCF Readiness support. A total of USD 4.5 million was\ndelivered as grants/technical assistance.\n4.8. Information on support received for the\nimplementation of Article 13 of the Paris Agreement\nand transparency-related activities, including\ntransparency-related capacity-building\nKenya received support from different sources to facilitate\nthe implementation of Article 13 of the Paris Agreement in\n2024. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) funding under the\nEnabling Activities was Kenya’s only direct funding to prepare\nthe first Biennial Transparency Report (BTR1). Kenya received\nan additional $250,000 for an existing National Communication\nProject, which was previously supported with $500,000. This\nbrings the total support for preparing the NC/BTR report to\n$750,000. The GEF funding enabled Kenya to compile NC3 and\nBTR. Due to internal administrative challenges that affected the\ndisbursement of project funds from UNEP, the GEF implementing\nentity supporting Kenya, Kenya could not receive the required\nresources within time to prepare the reports. The contributions\nfrom the Transparency Accelerator Initiative, GIZ, NAP-Global,\nCIAT, Fauna & Flora and CBIT-GSP through technical assistance\ncontributed to compiling the NC3 and BTR1.\nThe Common Tabular Formats have been submitted electronically\nto the UNFCCC.\n74\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nC h a p t e r 0 5 :\nEducation, Training, and Public\nAwareness\n5.1. Information on education, training, and public\nawareness.\nEducation, capacity building, awareness raising and dissemination\nof relevant information to the public play an essential role in\nincreasing knowledge and enhancing the capacity of communities\nto counter climate change and adapt to its impacts. Unfortunately.\nadequate knowledge of climate change and adaptation is\nlimited among the public in Kenya. The Post 2015 Development\nAgenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),\nthe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Paris\nAgreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda\non Financing for Development and the New Urban Agenda all\naim at ‘transforming our world’ through a people, prosperity,\nplanet, partnership and peace focus. The above listed 2030\nAgenda agreements unanimously recognize the importance of\neducation, capacity building and public awareness in the drive\ntowards achieving sustainable development goals.\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nand its Paris Agreement recognize education, training, and public\nawareness as critical elements in addressing the adverse effects of\nclimate change. Articles 4, paragraph 1(i), and 6 of the Convention\nprovide for Parties to report, inter alia, on public information and\neducation materials, resource or information centers, training\nprogrammes, and participation in international activities. Parties\nmay report on the extent of public participation in the preparation\nor domestic review of the national communication.\nArticle 10 (e) of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework\nConvention on climate change provides that parties Cooperate\nin and promote at the international level, and, where appropriate,\nusing existing bodies, the development and implementation of\neducation and training programmes, including the strengthening\nof national capacity building, in particular human and institutional\ncapacities and the exchange or secondment of personnel to train\nexperts in this field, in particular for developing countries, and\nfacilitate at the national level public awareness of, and public\naccess to information on, climate change. Suitable modalities\nshould be developed to implement these activities through the\nrelevant bodies of the Convention, taking into account Article\n6 of the Convention;\nArticle 12 of the Paris Agreement echoes the detailed content in\nArticle 6 of the Convention, noting that Parties shall cooperate\nin taking measures, as appropriate, to enhance climate change\neducation, training, public awareness, public participation, and\npublic access to information, recognizing the importance of these\nsteps with respect to enhancing actions under the Agreement.\nKenya is undertaking several initiatives on the six elements of\nACE. These initiatives are in the nascent stages and in response\nto the Kenya Climate Change Act (2016). The Act emphasizes\nthe formulation of public education and awareness strategy,\nintegration of climate change into the curricula, and formation\nof sector-based climate change units to facilitate climate change\ncoordination in the country. Kenya has already developed\nNational Climate Change Learning and Awareness Strategy\nthat addresses both Article 6 of the Convention and Article 12\nof the Paris Agreement, developed a national climate change\nresource center for climate change information, climate change\nportal for sharing and access to climate change information\nand climate change training manuals like solar installation and\ngreenmark standards.\n75\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nThe ongoing initiatives include: ; the development of guidelines\nfor mainstreaming climate change into all levels of formal\neducation system; regulations for public participation and\naccess to information and a tool for rating and certifying green\nbuildings The country is also in the process of finalizing the\nmonitoring, reporting and verification system that will help\nmonitor implementation of ACE.\n5.1.1.\nGeneral Policy on education, training, and public awareness\nArticle 69 of the Constitution of Kenya 2010 echoes all the\ndetailed elements of Article 12 of the Paris Agreement and\nArticle 6 of the Convention. It guides the country in its attempt\nto address the adverse effects of climate change in the context\nof sustainable development and the efforts to eradicate poverty.\nKenya enacted its climate change law in 2016 with an elaborate\nlegal framework for education, training, and public awareness.\nGuided by the provisions of the Climate Change Act 2016, relevant\nstakeholders across different sectors, including ministries, county\ngovernments, agencies, departments, non-state actors, and the\nmedia, have developed policy instruments, including guidelines,\ntraining handbooks, and frameworks to facilitate climate change\neducation, training, and public awareness.\nNumerous KAP (Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices) surveys show\nthat educated individuals are better equipped to understand and\nrespond to the impacts of climate change. Informed communities\ntend to be more organized and prepared to face climate-related\nchallenges. As a result, public participation plays a crucial role in\nshaping effective policies, while access to information ensures\nsound decision-making in the fight against climate change.\nThe government, through the Ministry of Environment, Climate\nChange and Forestry, developed regulations on public participation\nconsultations and access to climate change information, one\nof the critical regulations under the Climate Change Act 2016.\n5.1.2.\nFormal Education\nClimate change is one of the main priorities of the current\ngovernment. This has yielded significant efforts in mainstreaming\nclimate change education at the three levels of education in\nthe country. While tertiary institutions developed independent\nprogrammes on environmental studies earlier on, making it\neasy to integrate climate change elements, the primary and\nsecondary levels of education did not. This is because the previous\neducation system, had defined subjects that could not be revised\nto accommodate climate change education. However, initiatives\nlike establishing environmental clubs, essay competitions, and\ntree planting events were used at primary and secondary levels to\nraise awareness of environmental conservation, climate change\nmitigation, and adaptation.\nKenya adopted a new curriculum, the Competency-Based\nCurriculum (CBC), which aims to be a more student-based system,\nwith more focus on the ability of the student to self-learn and\ndevelop essential skills required for any engagement. The new\ncurriculum has created space for environmental activities from\npre-primary, making environmental awareness and education part\nof the learning achievements. The skill-based training program\nequips the pupils with relevant climate change mitigation and\nadaptation skills. Skills like seedling propagation are now taught\nin school. Kenya, through the office of the president, has initiated\nthe First Lady’s Mazingira Awards (FLAMA) is a learner-centered\nnational annual environment & climate change award, rolled\nout in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, Ministry of\nEnvironment, Climate Change and Forestry and other stakeholders.\nIt was launched on 7th September 2023 at the sidelines of the\nAfrica Climate Summit by Her Excellency the First Lady of the\nRepublic of Kenya. FLAMA provides a platform for learners to\ncreatively express their understanding, perceptions and solutions\nfor environmental conservation & climate change thus helping\nthem become environmentally conscious and climate ready\ncitizens.\n5.1.3.\nTraining Programmes\nThe State Department for Environment and Climate Change has\ncollaborated with many state and non-state actors to develop\ntraining programmes on climate change. Some of the notable\nprogrammes are\n1.\nClimate Change Policy, Planning and Budgeting Training\nProgramme - This programme was developed by the State\nDepartment for Environment and Climate Change and is\noffered at Kenya School of Government. The Kenya School\nof Government is responsible for the transformation of\nthe Public Service through the development of knowledge\nand competencies among public servants, leading to\ncontinuous improvement in the quality of services offered\nto citizens.\n2.\nCounty Climate Change Fund (CCCF) Mechanism\nCurriculum - The Kenya School of Government, in\npartnership with Adaptation Consortium on 4th August\n2022, launched the County Climate Change Fund (CCCF)\nMechanism Curriculum and Facilitator’s Guide. The CCCF\nCurriculum seeks to build the capacity of government\nofficers at the National and County level, Civil Society,\nand other stakeholders in managing financial resources\nfor climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in\nthe country.\n3.\nGreen Growth and Circular Economy – This training\ndeveloped by the Ministry of Environment and Climate\nChange and Foresty and offered at Kenya School of\nGovernment is designed to equip policymakers with\nrelevant skills towards enabling Kenya to attain a higher\neconomic growth rate consistent with Vision 2030, which\nfirmly embeds the principles of sustainable development\nin the overall national growth strategy.\n4.\nClimate Change Training Manual for Editors and Reporters\n- This training manual developed by the Media Council of\nKenya in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and\nClimate Change and Foresty is designed to equip editors\nand reporters with comprehensive knowledge and skills to\n76\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\neffectively cover climate change issues. It encompasses\na broad range of topics, from understanding climate\nchange to specialized reporting techniques, providing a\ndetailed framework to enhance journalistic quality and\naccuracy in climate-related reporting.\n5.\nClimate Finance Capacity Building Handbook – The\nhandbook developed by the Treasury and National Planning\nin collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and\nClimate Change and Foresty has been designed to help\nusers identify, examine, and select available instruments\nand mechanisms and possible pathways for mobilizing\nclimate finance.\n6.\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change and\nForesty, through the support of the Green Climate Fund\n(GCF) funded NAP Readiness Project, has taken all the\nCounty technical officers through the introductory training\non climate change.\nThese are just a few examples. However, there are many initiatives\nto enhance the capacity of government officers, stakeholders\nand the general public on climate change issues.\n5.1.4.\nResource and Information Centers\nThe government, with the support of the USAID through UNDP,\ndeveloped a National Climate Change Resource Centre equipped\nwith relevant resources on climate change. The resource center\nhas a library, an Amphitheatre, a GHG inventory lab, and office\nspaces for personnel. Members of the public can access the\nlibrary without paying anything. The government also encourages\nyouths in the climate change space to use the amphitheatre for\ntheir meetings, most of the time without any pay.\n5.1.5.\nPublic Participation (Involvement of the public and nongovernmental organizations)\nThe policy, legal, and institutional framework on climate change\nappreciates the role of the general public in policy influencing\nand implementing priority climate actions. The climate change\nact 2016 provides public participation and access to information\nthat ensures that public entities at each level of government,\nundertake public awareness and conduct public consultations\nwhen developing strategies, laws and policies relating to climate\nchange.\n5.1.6.\nParticipation in International Activities\nInternational activities are critical in shaping the multilateral\npolicy space on climate change. Since climate change is one\nof the priority areas of focus for the country, the government\nfacilitates the participation of relevant officers in international\nmeetings at the regional and international levels.\n5.1.7.\nMonitoring, review and evaluation of the implementation of Article 6\nof the Convention\nThe Ministry of Environment and Climate Change and Foresty has\ndeveloped the National Climate Change Learning and Awareness\nStrategy that has considered all the elements of Article 6 of the\nConvention. While the strategy has its monitoring plan , reporting\non the National Climate Change Learning and Awareness Strategy\nActions will be through Kenya’s Measurement, Reporting, and\nVerification Plus (MRV+) system, which is in the process of\ndevelopment. The Climate Change Directorate collaborates with\nstakeholders, including the Ministry of Education, to monitor and\nevaluate all elements of Article 6 of the Convention.\nSystems and Tools\nThe government of Kenya is in the process of developing a\nknowledge management system to facilitate access to climate\ninformation, including indicators for tracking Article 6 of the\nConvention. The Climate Change Directorate has also planned\nto develop an integrated MRV system to facilitate the tracking\nand reporting of climate information, including elements in\nArticle 6 of the Convention.\nPolicy\nThe government has developed an Education for Sustainable\nDevelopment (ESD) Policy (2017). The policy requires establishing\nsystematic monitoring frameworks to track the integration of\nsustainable development principles across all levels of education;\nregular monitoring of ESD implementation in schools, colleges,\nand universities is mandated and Tracking the progress of\nESD integration in curriculum, teaching methodologies, and\ninstitutional practices.\nInstitutions are required to prepare annual reports detailing their\nESD implementation strategies, Reporting on key performance\nindicators related to sustainable development education and\nTransparent documentation of progress, challenges, and\ninnovative approaches in ESD. Key reporting indicators include:\n\t•\nCurriculum development and integration of sustainability\ntopics\n\t•\nTeacher training and capacity building in ESD\n\t•\nStudent engagement in sustainable development activities\n\t•\nResource allocation for ESD initiatives\n\t•\nCommunity and stakeholder involvement\n77\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nOpportunities for improvement\n\t•\nDeveloping a more comprehensive electronic platform\nfor monitoring\n\t•\nEnhancing county-level reporting capabilities\n\t•\nImproving policy frameworks for addressing complex\nclimate change interactions\n\t•\nDevelop detailed MER operational guidelines\n\t•\nCreate a comprehensive indicator framework\n\t•\nEstablish baseline measurements\n\t•\nDesign stakeholder engagement mechanisms\n\t•\nImplement pilot monitoring and evaluation programs\n78\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nC h a p t e r 0 6 :\nResearch and Systematic\nObservations\n6.1. Introduction\nResearch continues to be a priority for Kenya especially in light\nof increasing impacts of climate change on virtually all sectors\nof the economy. Various institutions spearhead research in the\ncountry and work collaboratively across the country and with\nregional and international organizations.\nSeveral studies have been undertaken to document the current\nand ongoing impacts of changing climate on various weather\ndependent sectors across Kenya. Key among this is an IPCCbased study that domesticated the findings from the IPCC 6th\nassessment cycle to the local context with local examples and\nimpacts. This proves to be a quick resource for practitioners in\nthe field of climate change looking for policy relevant information\nfor among others programmatic planning in Kenya. Various other\nsuch reports have been developed with varied thematic foci and\ncontribute to evidence for policy development.\nThe Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) since 2020,\npublishes annual state of the climate in Kenya, reports and\ncontributes to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)\nGlobal state of the climate reports. These reports support an\nincreased understanding of the impacts of climate change on\nsectors as well as socioeconomic impacts.\n79\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n6.2. Research\n1.\nNational Climate Change Research Infrastructure\nThe National Research Fund (NRF) is mandated to facilitate\nresearch to advance Science, Technology and Innovation through\n6 thematic grants including;\na.\nMultidisciplinary research grants\nb.\nBilateral/ Multilateral Research Grants\nc.\nStrategic grants\nd.\nSupport for scientific events - seminars, forums, workshops\nand conferences.\ne.\nInnovation grants\nf.\nIncubation program grants\nSo far 6.1 billion Kenya shillings have been mobilized by the NRF\nwith contributions from the Kenyan Government, while serving\nmany thematic areas, significant amounts are directed towards\nclimate change research.\n2.\n Research projects\nVarious externally funded projects are run within and with Kenya,\nthat result in outputs in the form of research in peer reviewed\npapers.\nThe European Union through their HORIZON, 2020, DAAD and\nother programs have and continue to fund multi year research\nprojects in climate and climate change. The UK Government\nlikewise provides funding through UK ODA and Wellcome Trust\namong others for climate change related research. Various other\ninternational philanthropic organizations likewise fund research\nin the country including GIZ (Germany), Gates Foundation, IDRC\n(Canada), The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),\nUSAID (US).\n3.\n Research Themes\nIncreasingly the value of transdisciplinary research is being\ndemonstrated. Emerging climate change research projects in\nKenya are including socioeconomic insights in the design stage\nwhich lends itself to supporting strongly transdisciplinary research.\nThis has a greater positive impact on policy development and\non adaptation and mitigation strategy development.\nWith adaptation a national priority, many climate change research\nworks are focused on providing further support for adaptation.\nAs an example, recently extensive work has been done to\ndocument the research needs for adaptation for smallholder\nfarmers throughout the country. Additionally identifying the\nmitigation co-benefits of adaptation research contributes to\nachieving the global goals.\nResearch into mitigation strategies\nLinkages between climate change and health and further links\nto policy, is a globally emerging research area and Kenya is not\nleft behind in carrying out transdisciplinary research in this area.\n4. Research Gaps\nWithin the climate change space various gaps in knowledge and\nresearch exist. A non exhaustive list is below;\n1.\nUse of AI & ML for various applications including weather\nforecasting, model development, assessments, systematic\nreviews and the like\n2.\nHard adaptation limits in various sectors in Kenya\n3.\nSynthesization and/or documentation of indigenous\nknowledge\n4.\nGeoengineering and solar radiation management\n5.\nImpacts of global tipping points on regional and local\nweather regimes\n6.\n Assessment and documentation of indigenous, traditional\nand local knowledge in the fight against climate change.\n6.3. Training\nLeading universities in Kenya carryout training and research on\nclimate change in Kenya.\nThe University of Nairobi (UoN), Kenya’s leading public university\ncurrently offers a number of degrees on climate change. Their\nMaster’s of Science in Climate change course is one such one that\naims to equip students with knowledge and skills in the science\nand practical applications in Climate Change science. It draws\nstudent enrollments from various diverse fields seeking to either\nlink their sectors to climate change or pursue professional work in\nthe field of climate change. UoN has also made a name for being\nthe leading university offering a Bachelor’s of science degree in\nMeteorology within the east,central and southern Africa region.\nThis course draws students from all the surrounding countries.\nUoN likewise hosts the Institute of Climate Change & Adaptation\n(ICCA) which offers both Master’s and PhD programs aimed at\nboth researchers/academia and practitioners.\nRecently the South Eastern Kenya University (SEKU) has introduced\na Bachelor’s of Science degree in Meteorology as well, further\nenhancing an understanding of the dynamics of weather and\nclimate in the country.\nKenyatta University offers various courses in the field of climate\nchange.\nTheir Masters of Science (Climate Change and Sustainability)\naims “to train and produce climate change practitioners equipped\nwith knowledge and multi-disciplinary research skills necessary\nfor devising innovative and practical solutions to the dynamic\nclimate change and mitigation issues for sustainability.”\n80\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nThe Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) runs the Institute\nfor Meteorological Training and Research which is a WMO\nregional training center (WMO-RTC) The Institute is charged\nwith the responsibility of training personnel in Meteorology,\nOperational Hydrology and related geo-sciences in the country\nand the English-speaking countries in Africa and parts of Asia.\nIMTR regularly organises and hosts specialised training courses,\nworkshops and seminars in various fields of meteorology,\nhydrology, environmental science, disaster management and\nrelated geo-sciences by leveraging its existing infrastructure,\nmanpower and collaboration with other institutions both locally,\nregionally and internationally. The Institute offers regular courses\nas prescribed by WMO and tailor-made courses depending\non the training needs. The courses currently offered at the\ncentre cover the following fields: Meteorology, Meteorological\ninstruments and Calibration, Aeronautical Meteorology,\nOperational Hydrology and Water Resources, Remote Sensing\nand Satellite Meteorology, Geographical Information Systems\n(GIS), Data Processing and Management, Media, Information and\nCommunication, Environmental Science, Disaster Management,\nClimate Risk Management, Climate Change and Information\nand Communication Technology (ICT) IMTR is also part of the\nWMO Virtual Laboratory for Meteorological Satellite Education\nand Training (VLab) and, as such, has a mandate as a Centre of\nExcellence (CoE) to conduct training activities and support one\nor more Regional Focus Groups, representing the NMHSs in the\nregion. IMTR/WMO-RTC is a designated “Centre of Excellence”\nfor training Satellite Meteorology. It is one of the implementers\nof African Satellite Meteorology Education and Training (ASMET).\nFigure 6-1:\n Group Photo taken during a WMO Satellite Course on MTG at IMTR\nKenya is currently pursuing efforts to integrate climate change\neducation into the curriculum in public schools across Kenya. This\nis being done by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development\nin collaboration with UNICEF and Alef Education. The main aim\nof this initiative is to increase awareness, knowledge, and action\non climate change among learners and educators, ultimately\ncontributing to achieving Sustainable Development Goals key\nbeing Goal 13: Climate Action.\n81\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\n6.4. Systematic Observations\nFigure 6-2:\n Distribution of various observation stations across the country.\nSource: Shilenje & Ogwang 2015\n1.\nGround stations\nManual observation stations\nWith respect to systematic observations of the climate system,\nthe Kenya Meteorological Department is the WMO mandated\nNational Meteorological and Hydrological Service (NMHS) tasked\nwith providing early warning and climate information for safety\nof life, protection of property and conservation of the natural\nenvironment. As part of its mandate KMD operates and maintains\n34 synoptic observation stations including airport stations. This\nnumber of stations compared to the land area is significantly\nbelow the WMO acceptable standard. This data on key weather\nparameters is crucial for monitoring, trend detection as well as\nsupporting downscaling of climate projections.\nThe distribution of stations under the operation and maintenance\nof KMD is sparse (see fig). This does not comply with WMO\nstandards for station density.\n82\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nFigure 6-3:\n Station distribution & future plans\nSource: KMD\nAutomatic weather stations\nThe optimum number of Automatic Weather Stations for Kenya\nis 2400.\nCurrently KMD has 72 synoptic AWSs and 19 hydromet AWSs,\n(see fig xx) way below the requirement for optimum climate\nservice provision. Data from these AWS has been verified for\nthe most part and can reliably be used for research purposes.\nHowever various challenges exist with the running of the AWS,\nwith vandalism being foremost.\n83\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nFigure 6-4:\n Automatic weather stations\n2.\nAtmosphere Watch stations\nOzone research and monitoring activities in Kenya are the\ncountry’s effort to complement the international systematic\natmospheric observations in support of the spirit of the Vienna\nConvention. Kenya is committed to provide, in line with the\nobjectives of GAW-GO3OS, long-term records of ozone and other\nspecies that are essential for determining the variability of these\nspecies and their impacts on life and climate. Notably, the goal\nis the continued monitoring of tropospheric and stratospheric\nozone and the assessment of its variations that are relevant to\nthe wellbeing of the environment.\nOzone research and monitoring activities in Kenya are undertaken\nat three locations closely related to the Kenya Meteorological\nDepartment. Profiles of Ozone are taken weekly at Kenya\nMeteorological Department, while continuous measurements of\nsurface ozone and daily column ozone are measured at the Mount\nKenya GAW station and the University of Nairobi respectively.\nThe station on Mt. Kenya is one of 30 World Meteorological\nOrganizations (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) stations.\nSee fig below\n84\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nFigure 6-5:\n WMO Global GAW station distribution.\n3.\nOcean observations\nTwo tidal gauges are installed in the ports of the coastal cities\nof Mombasa and Lamu that measure sea level rise as part\nof a global network. Both Mombasa and Lamu are principal\nstations on the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS).\nData (hourly, daily and monthly means) from these gauges is\nshared with other centres and contributes to global Sea level\nrise monitoring. Available data from the Mombasa station dates\nfrom 1975/6 to 1986-2006 while in Lamu digital data is from\n1989, and 1996–2006.\nAdditional stations in Malindi, Kilifi and Shimoni contribute\nto multi- hazard detection, ocean waves height and strength\ndetection, sea level rise, salinity, sea surface temperature and\nwater quality, including tsunami related observations.\nThere’s a need to expand the observational network but various\nchallenges including finances still hamper this expansion.\nAssociated Training Requirements: More scientists need to be\ntrained on tide prediction and data analysis. This will serve\nto enhance the robustness of sea-level related research and\nprojections to support climate action .\n85\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)\n\nAnnexes\nAnnex I: Kenya GHG Inventory Document submitted as part\nof the BTR Report\n86\nKENYA’S THIRD NATIONAL COMMUNICATION (NC3)",

The Constitution establishes the right to food security\nwhile emphasizing sustainable and productive management of land and natural\nresources, such as a goal of tree cover of 10 per cent of the country’s land area.\nVision 2030 (2008)\nEncapsulates flagship programmes and projects with aspects of adaptation\nand mitigation.\nNational Policy for the\nSustainable Development of\nNorthern Kenya and other\nArid Lands (2012)\nFocuses on climate resilience requiring government to find solutions to address\nclimate challenges and to come up with measures to manage drought and\nstrengthen livelihoods.\nNational Disaster\nManagement Policy, 2012\nAims to increase and sustain resilience of vulnerable communities to hazards.\nEnvironmental Management\nand Coordination Act (1999)\nProvides the framework for the management of the environment.\nKenya Forestry Master Plan\n(1995-2020)\n\nRecognises the environmental role of forests including water values, biodiversity\nvalues, climate change values through carbon sequestration and other\nenvironmental services.\nWater Act (2002)\nProvides the overall governance of the sector, and recognises the climate change\nimplications on health, sanitation and water.\n\n 11\n\nAgricultural Sector\nDevelopment Strategy (20102020)\nProvides framework for transforming agriculture into a modern and\ncommercially viable sector. Notes that addressing food security will require\naddressing the challenge of over-dependence on rain fed agriculture.\nEnergy Policy and Act (2004)\n\nEncourages implementation of indigenous renewable energy sources to enhance\nthe country’s electricity supply capacity. The policy is implemented through the\nEnergy Act of 2006, which provides for mitigation of climate change, through\nenergy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy.\nIntegrated National\nTransport Policy (2010)\nProvides for transport solutions that have relevance to climate change\nmitigation\n\nTechnology Transfer\nKenya’s climate change technology needs are\ndiverse and their deployment requires a range\nof activities. Kenya has undertaken two\nTechnology Needs Assessments (TNAs), in 2005\nand 2013. The latter prioritised Environmental\nSustainable\nTechnology\n(EST)\nneeds\nfor\nmitigation and adaptation and developed their\ntechnology action plans (TAPs). The TNAs\ndetermined that priority technologies have high\nsocio-economic or sustainable development\nbenefits, and target the energy, waste,\nagriculture\nand\nwater\nsectors\nin\nrural\ncommunities. The key technologies are: solar\nhome systems, solar dryers, bio-digesters,\ndrought resistant sorghum, roof-surface water\nharvesting and drip irrigation.\n\nThe priority technologies have been deployed\nKenya, yet widespread diffusion has been\nlimited by such barriers as:\n\nx High cost of purchase, installation and\nmaintenance\nx Weak policies and lack of standards\nx Limited information and awareness.\nSuccessful diffusion requires robust outreach\nand awareness raising through training and\nknowledge transfer systems.\n\nResearch and Systematic Observation\nVarious\ninstitutions\nin\nKenya\nundertake\nsystematic observation and coordinate climate\nand climate change-related research activities\nand programmes in the country. The Kenya\nMeteorology Department (KMD), working\nclosely with Africa’s IGAD Climate Prediction\nand Applications Centre (ICPAC) and the\nInstitute for Meteorological Training and\nResearch (IMTR), has the overall mandate to\ncarry out climate and climate change-related\nresearch. The country hosts a number of\nobservational\nstations\nand\nan\nextensive\ncommunication network covering a Regional\nTelecommunications Hub (RTH) that collects\nobservational data originating from its own and\nassociated National Meteorological Centres\n(NMCs) and relaying such data directly to the\nglobal\nMain\nTelecommunication\nNetwork\n(MTN). Despite Kenya’s extensive observational\nnetwork, a lean meteorological budget means\nthat quantity and quality are considered\ninadequate to cover the country effectively.\nClimate monitoring networks in the ASALs – an\narea with high need - are extremely limited.\nFunding is required to establish an adequate\nobservational infrastructure.\n\nEducation, Training and Public Awareness\nClimate\nchange\nissues\nreceive\nminimal\nconsideration in Kenya’s formal education\nsystem. The level of awareness of climate\nchange issues and impact is low across the\ncountry. The NCCAP recommends increasing\nawareness and mainstreaming of climate\nchange issues in education curriculum, but\naction in this area has not progressed. In\naddition, high quality scientific research is\nneeded to update available knowledge and\nbuild confidence in mainstreaming climate\nchange information in decision making. The\n\n 12\n\nMENR is in the process of developing a Climate\nInformation Centre, which is expected to begin\nto fill information gaps when operational.\n\nCapacity Building\nNumerous capacity building initiatives in\nclimate change have been undertaken in Kenya,\nincluding through the GEF and the UNDP Low\nEmission Capacity Building programme. The\nareas\nof\nfocus\ninclude:\ninstitutional\nstrengthening; establishment of national focal\npoints; national climate change programmes;\ngreenhouse gas inventories; and vulnerability\nand adaptation assessments, amongst others.\nThe NCCAP recommended the development of\na National Framework for Climate Knowledge\nManagement and Capacity Development to\nimprove coordination and implementation of\ncapacity building initiatives.\n\nConstraints,\nGaps\nand\nRelated\nFinancial,\nTechnical and Capacity Needs\nImproved capacity to prepare and improve\nNational\nCommunications\n(NCs)\non\na\ncontinuous basis is a key need. This includes\nimproved monitoring networks and data\ncapture systems. Throughout the second NC\nprocess, and especially during the development\nof the GHG inventory, data availability and\nquality were a major concern. Adequate\nfunding is a key need to enable staff training\nand improve organizational arrangements.\n\nOther important gaps and constraints include\nthe need for improved predictions of potential\nclimate\nchange\nat\nsmaller\nscales,\nthe\ndevelopment of appropriate impact simulation\nmodels, and improved forecasting and early\nwarning systems. Improved communication\namong scientists, journalists, policy-makers and\nother stakeholders can help to improve\nawareness.\n\nThe Government of Kenya has improved its\ncapacity to manage climate change and is\nworking to improve legal and institutional\nframework. With the passing of the Climate\nChange Bill, funding and capacity building will\nbe required to enable the MENR and other\ninstitutions such as NEMA to effectively fulfil\ntheir expanded mandates.\n\n 13\n\nCHAPTER 1 KENYA NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES\nREPORT\n\nKenya National Circumstances\n\n 14\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINTRODUCTION\n15\nGOVERNMENT PROFILE\n15\nGEOGRAPHICAL PROFILE\n16\nLocation\n16\nTopography\n17\nCLIMATIC PROFILE\n17\nTemperature\n18\nPrecipitation\n18\nDisasters and extreme climatic events\n20\nPOPULATION PROFILE\n21\nNATURAL RESOURCES PROFILE\n23\nBiodiversity\n23\nForestry\n24\nWater Resources\n26\nECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND SERVICES PROFILE\n30\nEconomy\n30\nIndustry\n32\nMining, Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extraction\n33\nManufacturing\n33\nServices\n33\nAgriculture profile\n38\nEnergy profile\n40\nHealth Profile\n42\nEducation Profile\n43\nInstitutional Profile\n44\nNational Policies and Legislation\n45\nLead Government institutions for climate change\n46\nKenya on-going responses to Climate Change\n49\nConclusion\n49\n\n 15\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis chapter, provides information on Kenya’s\nnational circumstances, based on which, the\ncountry would be addressing the challenges due\nto climate change. These are important as they\ndetermine Kenya’s ability to mitigate and adapt\nto climate change while developing sustainably.\nThe chapter starts by providing an overview of\nKenya’s government structure and includes\nbrief descriptions of the country’s geographic\nand climatic characteristics. This is followed up\nwith the current status, prospects and plans for\nthe different environmental, economic and\nsocial\nsectors\nwithin\nthe\ncountry.\nThe\ninformation\nincludes\nindication\nof\nany\nassociated\nclimate\nchange\nimpacts,\nvulnerabilities, and risks and including brief\nreviews of a sector contribution to GHG\nemissions if of significance and where data is\navailable. It culminates with details on the\ncountry’s environmental and climate change\ngovernance.\nGOVERNMENT PROFILE\n\nThe Republic of Kenya (hereinafter referred to\nas ‘Kenya’) is a unitary State with a multi-party\npolitical system. Kenya became independent on\n12 December 1963 as a multi-party state,\nbecoming a one party state in 1982 and\nreverting back to multi-partism in 1992. In\n2010, the Government of Kenya (GoK) enacted\na new constitution (hereinafter referred to as\n‘the Constitution’) which created a devolved\ntwo tier government consisting of a national\ngovernment and county governments. The new\ngovernment\nstructure\ncame\ninto\neffect\nfollowing a general election in March 2013.\nThe Constitution and the new government\nstructure has brought in 47 constitutionally\nautonomous county governments that have\ndefined spheres of power and functions; a\nbicameral legislature;2 separation of powers\nbetween the three arms of government (the\nExecutive, Legislature and Judiciary) and more\nstringent requirements for transparency and\naccountability for holders of public office at all\nlevels.\n\nThe established devolution plays a major role in\nservice\ndelivery\nthrough\nthe\nCounty\nGovernments Act, 20123. The Act states that a\ncounty\ngovernment\nshall\nplan\nwithin\na\nframework that integrates economic, physical,\nsocial, environmental and spatial planning. The\nframework protects and develop natural\nresources in a manner that aligns national and\ncounty government policies. As such while the\nGoK has overall responsibility for ensuring that\nprogrammes are put in place to deliver its\nobligations\nunder\nthe\nUnited\nNations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), all the administrations under the\nnational and county governments play a part in\nmeeting this through the policies available to\nthem.\nClimate\nchange,\nbecause\nof\nits\ncrosscutting and multi-sectoral nature, is a\nfunction\nof\nthe\nnational\nand\ncounty\ngovernments\nand\nrequires\nconcurrent\njurisdiction\nacross\nboth\nlevels.\nFurther\ninformation\nabout\nthe\ninstitutional\narrangements\nand\nresponsibilities\nfor\nenvironment and climate related policies, plans\nand strategies is set out in Section IX below.\nIn July 2008, Kenya launched Vision 2030, the\nnational long-term development blueprint. It\naims to transform Kenya into a newly\nindustrialising,\nmiddle-income\ncountry\nproviding a high quality of life to all its citizens\nby 2030, in a clean and secure environment.\nVision 2030 is comprised of economic, social\nand political pillars. The economic pillar seeks to\nimprove the prosperity of all regions of the\ncountry and all Kenyans by achieving an average\n10 per cent Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\ngrowth rate per annum beginning in 2012. The\nsocial pillar seeks to create just, cohesive and\nequitable social development, in a clean and\nsecure environment, through investment in the\npeople of Kenya and improvement of the\nquality of life for all Kenyans. The political pillar\n\n 16\n\naims to realise an issue-based, people-centred,\nresult-oriented and accountable democratic\nsystem. The three pillars are anchored on the\nfoundations of macroeconomic stability which\ninclude infrastructural development, science,\ntechnology and innovation, land reforms,\nhuman resources development, security and\npublic sector reforms.\nVision 2030 is implemented in successive five\nyear Medium-Term Plans (MTP), through a\nnumber of flagship projects. The first MTP\ncovered the period 2008 – 2012 and the second\nMTP covers the period 2013-2017. Kenya’s\nresponse as a signatory of the UNFCCC has\nincluded preparation of the First National\nCommunication (FNC) in 2002, development of\nthe National Climate Change Response Strategy\n(NCCRS) in 2010, launch of the National Climate\nChange Action Plan (NCCAP) in 2013 and\nsubmission of a Climate Change Bill to\nParliament\nin\n2014.\nThe\nMinistry\nof\nEnvironment and Natural Resources (MENR) has\ndesignated a Climate Change Secretariat to\nguide its climate change response, and several\nsectoral ministries have designated climate\nchange units.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL PROFILE\nLocation\nKenya, which is almost bisected by the Equator,\nextends between latitudes 5oN and 5oS and\nlongitudes 34oE and 42oE. It is bordered by\nSouth Sudan and Ethiopia to the north, Uganda\nto the west, Somalia to the east, Tanzania to\nthe southwest and Indian Ocean to the\nsoutheast (Figure 5). It spans a territorial area of\n582,646 km2 consisting of 11,230 km2 of water\nsurface and 571,416 km2 land area. Of the total\nland area, approximately 490,000 km2 (about 85\nper cent) is classified as arid and semi-arid land\n(ASALs).4,5\n\nFigure 5: Map of Kenya\n\nSource: Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) - 2013; Government of Kenya\n\n 17\n\nTopography\n\nKenya’s landscape relief stretches from sea\nlevel to about 5,200m above sea level at the\npeak of Mount Kenya.6 Its topography is\ndescribed as simple and diverse. The simplicity\nis due to its relief being easily separated into\nlowlands and uplands while termed diverse\nbecause of its varied landforms types which are\ndivided into plains, escarpments, hills with low\nand high mountains and breaks.7 Figure 6 shows\nthat from the coastline in the southeast, one\ncomes to a narrow low-lying plain. The altitude\nthen gradually changes to low plateaus, mainly\nof semi-arid nature that spread in the eastern\nand northern parts of the country and sparsely\npopulated. From the low plateaus the terrain\nruns to an elevated plateau and mountain\nregion in the southwest (forming the Kenyan\nhighlands).\n\nFigure 6: Topography of Kenya\n\nSource: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe highlands contain the bulk of the country's\npopulation and farmland. The highlands are\ncool and agriculturally rich. Both large and\nsmall-holder farming is carried out here. Major\ncash crops are tea, coffee, flowers, vegetables,\npyrethrum, wheat and maize. Livestock farming\nis also practised. Much of the highlands lie\n1,500 to 3,000 m above sea level and are dotted\nby extinct volcanoes. The Great Rift Valley\nbisects the highlands into east and west forming\na steep sided trench of 30 to 40 miles (48 to 64\nkm) wide and 600 to 900 m deep.8 Mount\nKenya the highest mountain in the country is\nfound on the eastern side while Mount Elgon is\nto the western side on the border of Kenya and\nUganda.\n\nCLIMATIC PROFILE\nKenya’s climate varies considerably across the\ncountry. It is hot and humid at the coast,\ntemperate inland, and very dry in the north and\nnortheast parts of the country. The climate is\nheavily influenced by its variable topography\nand the N-S migration of zonal arm of the Inter\nTropical\nConvergence\nZone\n(ITCZ).\nIts\ngeographic location also makes the country\n\n 18\n\nprone to cyclical droughts and floods with\nclimate change expected to make such types of\nclimate driven events increase in intensity and\nfrequency.\n\nTemperature\n\nKenya’s temperatures vary dramatically, with\nthe highlands experiencing considerably cooler\ntemperatures than the coastal and lowland\nregions.\nAccording\nto\nthe\nclimate\nrisk\nassessment undertaken during the NCCAP -\nobserved temperature data for the country\nshows a distinct warming trend. Observed\nclimate data for Kenya shows a distinct\nwarming trend since the 1960s.9 From the early\n1960s,\nKenya\nhas\nexperienced\ngenerally\nincreasing temperature trends over vast areas.\nOver the inland areas, the trends in both\nminimum (night/early morning) and maximum\n(daytime) temperatures depict a general\nwarming (increasing) trend with time. However,\nthe increase in the minimum temperatures is\nsteeper than in maximum temperatures. The\nresult of the steeper increase in Tmin and a less\nsteep increase Tmax is a reduction in the\ndiurnal temperature range (difference between\nthe maximum and minimum temperatures) –\nFigures 34-39 depict these trends for some\nselected\nrepresentative\nlocations\nin\nthe\ncountry. (Refer to Figures 33-38 in Chapter 3;\nClimate Change Scenarios; Present Climate\nChange (Trends and Baseline) from page 98.)\n\nTemperatures in Kenya, since 1960, have\nexhibited an incremental trend. The annual\nmean increase has been estimated at 10C with\nan average rate of 0.210C per decade.\n\nTemperature Projections\nThe country’s temperature projections are\nbased on General Circulation Models, (GCMs),\nalso known as Global Climate Models. The A1B\n(medium) scenario described in this SNC is one\nof the four main groups of emissions scenarios\nused by the Intergovernmental Panel on\n\nClimate Change (IPCC). The A1B describes a\nfuture world of very rapid economic growth, a\npopulation that peaks in mid-century and\ndeclines thereafter with a rapid introduction of\nnew and more efficient technologies with\nbalance across all energy sources.\n\nThe\ndata\nindicates\nthat\nthe\nfollowing\ntemperature trends are considered likely,\nrelative to the baseline period 1961-1990:10\n\nx Mean annual temperature is projected to\nincrease by between 0.8 and 1.5°C by the\n2030s and 1.6°C to 2.7°C by the 2060s;\nx An increase is projected in the frequency of\nhot days and hot nights. Projections indicate\nthat hot days could occur on 19-45 per cent of\ndays by the 2060s and 26-69 per cent of days\nby the 2090s. Hot nights are projected to\nincrease more quickly, occurring on 45-75 per\ncent of nights by mid-century and 64-93 per\ncent of nights by the end of the century;\nx Projections suggest a decrease in the number\nof days and nights that are considered ‘cold’\nin the current climate. Cold days and nights\nare expected to become very rare.\n\nUnder the same emissions scenarios GCM\nprojections suggest that there will be no cold\ndays or nights by the 2090s.11\n\nPrecipitation\nKenya’s average annual precipitation is typically\n680 mm, ranging from less than 250 mm in the\nnorthern ASALs areas to about 2,000 mm in the\nwestern region (Figure 7).12 The high rainfall\nzone, which receives more than 1,000 mm of\nannual rainfall is the productive agricultural\nland. It occupies less than 20 per cent of the\ncountry’s land area and carries approximately\n80 per cent of the population.13 The ASALs with\nannual rainfall of less than 750mm occupies\nmore than 80 per cent of the land area, and\nsupport about 20 per cent of Kenya’s\npopulation and 70 per cent of the livestock\nproduction.14\n\n 19\n\nOn an annual basis, precipitation in the country\nis governed primarily by the movement of the\nITCZ which migrates south through Kenya in\nOctober to December and returns northwards\nin March to May. The rainfall distribution,\ntherefore, depicts very strong seasonality The\nITCZ brings wet weather to the region resulting\nto most parts of Kenya having two distinct wet\nperiods(bimodal rainfall distribution): The ‘Long\nRains’ (March to May) and the ‘Short Rains’\n(October to December). The ‘Long Rains’ are\nabundant over most parts of the country and\ncontribute significantly to the annual rainfall\ntotals. The “Short Rains” are more abundant\nand reliable in the South-eastern lowlands and\nparts of the eastern highlands. The two distinct\nrainfall seasons are separated by two dry\nperiods that occur in mid-December to midMarch (hottest and driest period) and June to\nSeptember (cool season) in most areas.\n\nSome areas near large water bodies, receive\nrainfall throughout the year (mean monthly\nrainfall > 50mm for all the twelve months. In\naddition, some areas in western Kenya\nextending to parts of central Rift Valley exhibit a\ntri-modal rainfall distribution (Three peaks) with\nthe third rainfall peak occurring in July/August\nperiod.\n\nFigure 7: Distribution of mean annual rainfall\n\nSource: World Resources Institute (2013)\n\n 20\n\nKenya’s rainfall also varies over longer time\nperiods.15 Annual variation in rainfall is\ninfluenced\nby\nfactors\nsuch\nas\nsurface\ntemperatures patterns of the Indian Ocean and\nthe upper level wind regimes. Warmer than\naverage sea surface temperatures in the\nequatorial eastern and Central Pacific Ocean –\nEl Niño episodes – usually result in above\naverage rainfall in the short rainfall season,\nwhereas colder than average sea surface\ntemperatures in the same region – La Niña\nepisodes – bring depressed (below average)\nrainfall in the same season.16 As the ‘short rains’\nare most affected by the presence of El Niño\nconditions, they account for the majority of the\ninter-annual rainfall variability (estimated at\nabout 74 per cent). 17 Although the current\navailable evidence suggests little overall change\nin precipitation, there is significant geographical\ndiversity in observed rainfall trends. Rainfall\ntrends in Kenya since 1960 have shown the\nfollowing specific characteristics:18\nx Some evidence shows that northern areas of\nthe country have become wetter, and\nsouthern areas drier, although this is subject\nto considerable uncertainty; 19\nx Trends in extreme rainfall events based on\ndaily rainfall data are mixed. They show a\ngenerally increasing trend in the proportion of\nheavy rainfall events;20\nx Trends for one day rainfall maxima and five\nday rainfall maxima also show inconsistent\ntrends;\nx Periodic droughts occur in Kenya relatively\nfrequently. Moderate drought events have\nbeen recorded on average every three to four\nyears and major droughts affect the country\nevery ten years on average. Prolonged\ndroughts have become more common since\n2000.\n\nPrecipitation projections\nGCM data indicates that the following trends\nmay be seen for rainfall in Kenya. The statistics\nare for an A1B (medium) emissions scenario\nunless otherwise stated:21\nx There may be increases in average annual\nrainfall in Kenya by the 2060s. However there\nis considerable model disagreement with a\nrange of projections varying from a 5 per cent\ndecrease to a 17 per cent increase by the\n2030s and no change to a 26 per cent\nincrease by 2060s;\nx The increase in total rainfall is projected to be\nlargest from October to December (-6 mm to\n+29 mm per month by 2030s and 0mm to 30\nmm by the 2060s) and proportional changes\nlargest in January and February (-14 per cent\nto +50 per cent by 2030s and -6 per cent to\n+60 per cent by the 2060s). The broad span of\nprojections indicates high levels of model\ndisagreement;\nx The proportion of annual rainfall that occurs\nin heavy events will increase. The range of\nincrease varies from 2 to 11 per cent by the\n2060s and 2 to 12 per cent by the end of the\ncentury;\nx There is relatively good model agreement\nthat 1 and 5-day rainfall annual maxima will\nincrease. The range of predicted increase for\n5-day events is between 2 to 19mm by the\n2060s and 2mm to 24mm by the end of the\ncentury.\n\nDisasters and extreme climatic events\nMore than 70 per cent of natural disasters in\nKenya result from extreme climatic events22 the\nmost common being floods and droughts.\nRecent major droughts occurred in 1991–1992,\n1995–1996, 1998–2000, 2004–2005 and 2009.23\nMajor floods occurred in 1997/98 and 2006.\nThere are indications that these have intensified\nin recent episodes reflecting a changing climate.\nThe repeated pattern of droughts and floods\nhas large impacts and high economic costs.\nDroughts cost an estimated 8 per cent of GDP\nevery five years24. For instance the 1998 to 2000\ndrought was estimated at US$ 2.8 billion from\nthe loss of crops and livestock, forest fires,\ndamage to fisheries, reduced hydropower\ngeneration, reduced industrial production and\nreduced water supply.25 The impacts of such\nevents are exacerbated by socio-economic\n\n 21\n\ntrends (see Box 1 for a description of flood\ndamage). For example, a significant part of the\nflood damage has been attributed to the\nincrease in population, urbanisation, and value\nassets in flood-prone areas. Changes in the\nterrestrial system, such as deforestation and\nloss of natural floodplain storage, also\n\ncontribute\nto\nincreased\nflooding\nand\ndamage.26The continued annual burden of\nthese events leads to large economic costs\n(possibly as much as $0.5 billion per year,\nequivalent to around two per cent of GDP) and\nreduces long-term growth.27\n\n __________________________________\nPOPULATION PROFILE\n\nKenya is characterised by a rapidly growing\npopulation, rapid urbanisation and increasing\nurban poverty, water scarcity, declining food\nproduction and low resilience to climate\nchange. The combined effects of climate change\nand rapid population growth increase food\ninsecurity, environmental degradation and\npoverty levels in in the country.\nKenya’s population was 37.7 million in the 2009\nnational census, a 9 million person increase\nfrom the 28.7 million reported in the 1999\ncensus. The population is estimated to have\nincreased to 41.8 million in 2013 and is\nprojected to reach 46.7 million by 2017.28 Figure\n8 illustrates this population trend, an increase\nof one million per year.29 This growth is largely a\nresult of past high fertility, which peaked at 8.1\nchildren per woman in 1978 and declined to 4.6\nchildren per woman in 200830. The 2009 census\nreported a population density of 66.4 persons\nper square km in 2009], and this is expected to\nincrease to 80.3 persons per square km by\n2017.31 A high percentage of the population\ndensity is concentrated in the non-ASALs areas\n(about 15 per cent of land area). This puts\npressure\non\nnatural\nresources\ncausing\nsubstantial\nenvironmental\ndegradation,\nparticularly deforestation, and constraining the\ncountry’s\nability\nto\ndevelopment\nin\na\nsustainable\nmanner.\nAddressing\nboth\npopulation growth and climate change should\nbe a top priority.\n\nFigure 8: Population trend, Kenya, 2000-2013\n\nSource: derived from The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data\n\n 22\n\nKenya is in the second stage of general\ndemographic transition models, illustrated in\nFigure 9. This situation is characterised by\ndeclining birth and mortality rates, although the\nbirth rate is higher than the mortality rate\nleading to an increasing ‘youth bulge’.32 Youth\ncomprise about 36 per cent of the national\npopulation but worryingly 61 per cent of them\nremain unemployed.33 The reasons are mainly\nattributed to a lack of vocational or professional\nskills demanded by the job market (about 92\nper\ncent\nfall\nin\nthis\ncategory).34\nThe\nunemployment\nchallenge\nis\nfurther\ncompounded by a low transition to and low\ncompletion rates in secondary education. In\naddition, youth face limited opportunities for\ntechnical and vocational skills training.\n\n Figure 9: Population pyramid for Kenya, 2004 compared with 2009\n\nSource: Derived from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data\n\nA narrowing of the pyramid particularly for 50+\nyears indicates a shorter life expectancy.\nFemales outnumber males at older ages (65-69\nyears) reflecting a higher life expectancy of\nfemales. Women represent 51 per cent of the\ncountry’s population.35\n\nThe majority of the Kenyan population (about\n67.7 per cent) resides in rural areas. However\nthis situation is changing with an increase in\nrural-urban migration.36 The 2009 census\nshowed that the urban population increased\nfrom 5.4 million in 1999 to 12.2 million in 2009.\nClose to half of all Kenyans are projected to be\nurban residents by 205037. Kenya’s urban\npopulation is growing at four per cent per\nannum.38 The increase in urban population and\nlimited affordable housing has resulted in\ninformal settlements with limited housing,\nsanitation, water, energy and waste disposal.\nThe growth of urban population, and the\naccompanying urban poverty (in Kenya about\n55 percent of urban residents currently live in\npoverty in informal settlements) presents a\nmajor development challenge. Residents in\ninformal settlements are highly vulnerable to\nclimate change impacts such as flooding, fires,\nand landslides and often lack basic amenities\n\n 23\n\nand proper sanitation. Better urban planning\nand reforms could help Kenya make the most of\nthe socioeconomic benefits of urbanisation and\nreduce reliance on natural resources such as\nagricultural land.\n\nAbout 46 per cent of the population is under\nthe national poverty line.39,40 Table 3 shows the\nprevalence of poverty in rural areas (49.1 per\ncent) compared to urban areas (33.7 per cent).\nThere are wide variations across counties.\nCounties in the ASALs such as Kitui, Marsabit,\nMandera, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana and\nWest Pokot have poverty levels above 70 per\ncent. These counties are very dry but and\ncharacterised by relatively weak infrastructure\nand poor access to public services.\n\nTable 3: Poverty and inequality in Kenya (per cent), 1993-2006\n\n1992\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2006\nUrban\n\n29.3\n29.0\n49.2\n51.5\n33.7\nRural\n\n 46.0\n46.8\n52.9\n59.6\n49.1\nTotal (urban\nand rural)\n\n41.841\n40.0\n52.3\n56.8\n45.9\nInequality*\n(per cent)\n\n56.9\n44.3\n41.9\n-\n45.2\n\n*Based on Gini coefficient representation of Kenya’s population income distribution\nSource: Modified from UNEP. (2014). Green Economy Assessment Report – Kenya\n\nDespite government efforts to reverse the\npoverty situation, Kenyans below the poverty\nline continue to lack critical services such as\naccess to quality healthcare services, water\nsupply and education. Economic gains have\nlargely\nbenefited\nthe\nwealthiest\nquintile\ncontributing to the country’s social and\neconomic gap (inequality) with great disparities\nbetween the rural and urban areas.\n\nThe poverty and inequality situation expose\nKenyans to climate risk hazards rendering them\nvulnerable to climate change. According to the\nIPCC Working Group II (WGII) 5th Assessment\nReport (AR5) poverty and inequality are the\nmost salient conditions that shape climate-\nrelated vulnerability. Poverty affects livelihood\noptions and creates conditions where people\nhave few assets to buffer extreme events.\nClimate change is an additional burden to the\npoor.\n\nNATURAL RESOURCES PROFILE\n\nBiodiversity\n\nKenya is endowed with a rich biodiversity due\nto the abundance of species within the\ncountry’s varied ecosystems. It is home to five\nglobally important biodiversity hot spots and\nincludes 62 Important Bird Areas (IBAs)42 among\nothers.\nThe\nInternational\nUnion\nfor\nConservation of Nature (IUCN) ranks Kenya\nsecond in Africa in terms of mammalian species\ndiversity.43 Kenya is famous for its diverse group\nof large mammals like the leopard, buffalo,\nblack rhinoceros, African elephant, and African\nlion (also known as the big five). Wildlife based\ntourism contributes about 70 per cent of the\ngross tourism earnings, demonstrating the\nimportance of biodiversity to the economy.44\nThe country’s existing protected area (PA)\nsystem takes care of most of its biodiversity, but\nstill fall short. Kenya’s State of Environment\n\n 24\n\nreport 2010 identifies threats to the country’s\nbiodiversity in the PAs and beyond: humanwildlife conflict; poaching; overexploitation and\nhuman encroachment (human settlements and\nexpansion of their livelihood activities of\nagricultural and livestock development) due\npopulation increase.\n\nNotwithstanding the human-wildlife conflicts,\nclimate\nchange\nhas\na\ndirect\nlink\nwith\nbiodiversity\nand\nspecies\ndiversity\nloss.\nBiodiversity is habitat specific; whenever there\nare changes in climate particular species\ndisappear from their current habitats and new\nspecies appear leading to ecosystem changes.\nObserved changes in Kenya include the drying\nup of rivers and migration of species to new\nhabitats.45\nKenya\nWildlife\nService\n(KWS)\nresearchers confirmed that climate change and\necological disturbances caused an observed\nincrease of infectious diseases leading to deaths\nin wildlife populations. Birds and mammals\nhave been the worst affected, with climate\nchange blamed for the sudden mass death of\nflamingos around Lake Nakuru in the Rift Valley\nin 2006. Hence climate change poses serious\nthreats to biodiversity in Kenya both in aquatic\nand\nterrestrial\necosystems.\nThe\ntourism\nindustry is heavily dependent on biodiversity\nconditions and quality, and climate change is\nexpected to have profound impacts on\nbiodiversity.\n\nForestry\nForests are of high value in Kenya, having\ncritical ecological, social, cultural, and economic\nfunctions. Over 75 per cent46 of Kenya's\nrenewable surface water originates from the\ncountry’s water towers and catchments. The\ncritical water role of forests is important for the\npopulation’s livelihoods, irrigated agriculture,\nand production of hydro-electric power. Forests\ncontribute directly and indirectly to national\nand\nlocal\neconomies\nthrough\nrevenue\ngeneration and wealth creation. Forestry\ncontributes an estimated 3.6 per cent of\nKenya's GDP, excluding charcoal and direct\nsubsistence uses.47\n\nForest classification in the country is based on\ndefinitions set out by the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO). Forest is defined as a group\nof trees featuring a tree canopy cover of over\n10 per cent, with crowns that are largely\ncontiguous. There are five distinct classes:48\nindigenous closed canopy forests, indigenous\nmangroves, open woodlands, public plantation\nforests and private plantation forests.\n\n 25\n\nFigure 10: Forest classes’ area trend, Kenya, 1990 – 2010\n\nSource: Global Forest Resource Assessment Country Report FAO, page 9 cited in the NCCAP\nMitigation Chapter forestry analysis\n\nFigure 10 shows the area of each of the\nforestland classes in total land area from 1990\nto 2010. Forestry cover comprises mainly open\nwoodlands, encompassing approximately 59 per\ncent of the country’s forest area. Indigenous\nclosed canopy is the second largest class at\napproximately 33 per cent, with public and\nprivate plantations and mangroves making up\nthe remaining share.\n\nFigure 11: Forest area trend, Kenya, 1990-2010\n\nSource: Global Forest Resource Assessment Country Report\n\n 26\n\nKenya has experienced a decline in forest cover\n(Figure 11). At independence in 1963, Kenya’s\nforest cover stood at about 11 per cent.49\nApproximately 12,000 hectares of forest a year\nhave\nbeen\nlost\nthrough\ndeforestation.50\nBetween 1990 and 2010, for instance, forest\ncover fell from 12 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent\nin 2010.51 The drivers of deforestation are\nmainly unsustainable utilisation and conversion\nof forest land to other land uses.52 About 80 per\ncent of Kenyans rely on wood biomass53 for\ntheir energy requirements and forests also\nprovide other goods to support their livelihoods\nsuch as timber materials. The livelihood needs\nexerts\nconsiderable\npressure\non\nforest\nresources. In addition, the technologies used for\nwood conversion for timber manufacturing and\ncharcoal production are obsolete and wasteful\nleading to overharvesting of trees to meet the\ndemand. As a result deforestation in Kenya has\nbeen high, with a yearly loss to the economy of\nover USD 19 million.54\n\nThe situation is reversing with forestry cover\nestimated as 6.99 per cent as noted in the\ncountry’s National Forest Policy, 2014. The\nincrease is an improvement from 6 per cent in\n2010 and represents good progress toward the\nConstitution’s target of 10 per cent forest cover.\n\nClimate changes is expected to further increase\nforest\ndegradation\npossibly\nresulting\nin\ndesertification.55 This will have adverse impacts\non the economic benefits and livelihoods\nderived from this sector, as well as biodiversity\nand other environmental services. GoK is\nworking to address these challenges, including\nthe development of a national strategy for\nReducing Emissions from Deforestation and\nForest Degradation and fostering conservation,\nsustainable\nmanagement\nof\nforests,\nand\nenhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+).\nThe strategy seeks to incentivise activities to\nhelp meet the tree cover goal of the\nConstitution and Vision 2030. The country has\n\ngained experience in REDD+ through the\nKasigau Wildlife Corridor Project, the first\nactivity in Africa to issue voluntary forestry\ncarbon credits. Other REDD+ projects are under\ndevelopment, including the Mikoko Pamoja\nmangrove restoration project in Kwale and a\nsecond phase of the Kasigau Corridor project.\nThe National Forest Policy 2014 and the Forests\nAct 2005 are the main policy and legislative\ninstruments in this sector, and encourage\nprogress toward the 10 per cent forest cover\nthrough industrial plantations, agroforestry,\nurban forestry and activities implemented by\nlocal forest authorities.\n\nWater Resources\nThe water sector in Kenya underpins its main\neconomic sectors of agriculture, livestock,\ntourism,\nmanufacturing\nand\nenergy.\nThe\ncountry is divided into six major drainage basins\n(Figure 12) consisting of: Lake Victoria North\n(18,374 km2); Lake Victoria South (31,734 km2);\nRift Valley (130,452 km2); Athi (58,639 km2);\nTana (126,026 km2); and Ewaso Ng’iro North\n(210,226 km2).56\n\nIts drainage system is dense with many\nephemeral streams and perennial rivers of\nwhich a small number are permanent. The\npermanent rivers are; Tana, Athi, Sondu, Yala,\nMara, Nzoia and Nyando. Several of these are\ndamned upstream to provide hydroelectricity,\nirrigation and water for domestic use. The main\nrivers drain radially from the central highlands\ninto the rift valley, eastward into Indian Ocean\nand westward into Lake Victoria. Those north of\nMount Elgon and from the highlands along\nSouth Sudan-Ethiopia border drain mainly into\nLake Turkana. The country’s five water towers -\nMount Kenya, Aberdares Ranges, Mau Complex,\nMount Elgon and Cherangany hills - are the\nsource of these rivers. These valuable towers\nare under continuous threat from human\nencroachment which has contributed to the\ndrying up of some of the rivers and streams.57\n\n 27\n\nIn 1992, Kenya was categorised as a water\nscarce country with per capita available water\nresources of 647 m3 per person, below the\ninternationally acceptable threshold of 1000 m3.\nThis was reduced to 586 m3 in 2010 (Table 4)\nlimited availability is further aggravated by\nrapid\npopulation\nincrease\nand\nclimate\nvariability. The scarcity has serious implications\nfor the key sectors of tourism, agriculture and\nindustry, as well as Vision 2030’s flagship\nprojects which rely heavily on water availability.\n\n Figure 12: Kenya water catchment areas\n\n Source: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\nTable 4: Renewable and available water resources\nItem\n2010\n2030\n2050\nPrecipitation (P) *(BCM/y)\n400.1\n441.6\n479.1\nEvapotranspiration € **(BCM/y)\n358.0\n397.3\n425.9\nRenewable WR (P-E) (BCM/y)\n42.1\n44.3\n46.0\nRenewable SW (BCM/y)\n20.6\n24.9\n26.7\nGW Recharge (BCM/y)\n21.5\n19.4\n19.3\nSustainable Yield of GW*** (BCM/y)\n1.9\n1.7\n1.7\nAvailable Water Resources (BCM/y)\n22.5\n26.6\n28.4\nPopulation Projected (million)\n38.5\n67.8\n96.9\nper Capita RWR (m3/y/capita)\n1,093\n653\n475\nper Capita Available WR (m3/y/capita)\n586\n393\n293\nSource: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\nNote: * Multi-model ensemble analysis of 11 GCMs for 2030 and 2050\n** Estimation by FAO Penman-Monteith method\n*** 10% of GW recharge excluding river and riparian areas\n\n 28\n\nFigure 13 gives the distribution of renewable\nsurface water resources while Figure 14\nillustrates the available surface and ground\nwater yields.

The ITCZ brings wet weather\nto the region resulting to Kenya’s two distinct\nwet periods: The ‘long rains’ (March to May)\nand the ‘short rains’ (October to December).\nThe ‘long rains’ bring approximately 70 per cent\nof Kenya’s total rainfall with the ‘short rains’\ncontributing a further 20 per cent.58 The\nremaining six months of the year are typically\ndry, contributing just 10 per cent of the\ncountry’s total rainfall.59\n\nThe Tana and Lake Victoria basins are those\nwith the most renewable surface water\nresources. Athi has the least renewable water\nsources and is the catchment serving the two\nmain cities: Nairobi and Mombasa. The uneven\ndistribution across the basins is a big challenge\nfor water resource management.\n\n 29\n\nFigure 14: National Water Master Plan 2030 available surface and groundwater water yields\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\nLVN\n(0.276)\nLVS\n(0.187)\nRV\n(0.024)\nAthi\n(0.028)\nTana\n(0.062)\nENN\n(0.014)\nRWR (BCM/y)\nSurface Water\n24.9 BCM/y\nGroundwater\n(Sustainable Yield)\n1.7 BCM/y\n\nSource: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\n\nKenya’s water scarcity is expected to be more\nsevere in the future due to an overwhelming\nincrease\nof\nwater\ndemands\nagainst\na\nsubstantially reduced per capita availability of\n393 m3 by 2030 (see Table 5). Figure 15 shows\nthat water demand in 2010 was driven by\nirrigation (50 per cent), domestic use (37 per\ncent) and livestock (8 per cent). Industrial, and\ninland fisheries demand also contributed to the\nrise in water use, although to a lesser degree.\nThe demand from irrigation will increase further\nas Vision 2030 seeks to expand irrigable land by\n1.2 million ha.60 The demand will be greatest in\nthe Tana and Ewaso Ng’iro catchments that\nserve the ASALs region.\n\nFigure 15: Kenya’s water demand 2010\n\nSource: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\n\n 30\n\nIncreased demand from domestic, livestock and\nindustrial activities is also expected due to the\npopulation growth, as well as implementation\nof Vision 2030 flagship projects.\n\nClimate change is likely to cause changes in\nwater availability in terms of quantity and\nquality, and increasing frequency of floods and\ndroughts is expected to impact the state of the\navailable freshwater resources. Competition for\nthe resource is expected to increase, resulting\nin water resource conflicts between upstream\nand\ndownstream\nusers\nand\nbetween\nagriculturalists and pastoralists.\n\nThe governance framework in the water sector\nis based on the National Water Policy Sessional\nPaper No. 1 of 1999, which was operationalised\nby the enactment of the Water Act in 2002. The\nreforms have aimed at improving service\ndelivery, increasing community participation,\nincreasing\ninvestments\nand\nimplementing\nIntegrated\nWater\nResources\nManagement\n(IWRM). IWRM has intensified activities on\nforestry, soil conservation, and improved land\nuse and water catchment management. To\nproperly develop and manage resources in the\ncountry, the GoK formulated the National\nWater Master Plan in 1992 (NWMP) and\nupdated National Water Master Plan 2030\n(NWMP 2030). The NWMP 2030 factors in new\ncircumstances particularly increasing water\ndemand, impacts of climate change, population\ngrowth,\nand\nalso\nsocial\nand\neconomic\ndevelopments.\n\n ___________________________________\n\nECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND SERVICES PROFILE\n\nEconomy\nKenya is a lower middle-income country with an\nestimated national GDP of US$ 60.9 billion in\n2014.61 Figure 16 gives a visualisation of\nKenya’s\nGDP\ntrend\nfrom\n2000-2013,\ndemonstrating\nthat\nKenya’s\neconomic\nperformance has varied.\n\nFigure 16: National GDP growth rates\n\nSource: Derived from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data (Data for\n2001 and 2002 not available from source)\n\n 31\n\nGDP growth rates peaked in 2007 at 7.1 per\ncent per annum. Post-election violence in early\n2008 compounded with drought, high global\nenergy and food prices together with the\neffects of the global financial crisis on\nremittance and exports, reduced GDP growth to\n1.5 per cent in 2008.62 The economy rebounded\nin 2010 with GDP growth rates at about six per\ncent, with a slight decline in 2011 and 2012.\n\nFigure 17: Sector contribution to Kenya’s GDP\n\n Source: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\nFigure\n17\nshows\nthe\ndifferent\nsectors’\ncontributions\nto\nGDP\nin\nthe\ncountry.\nApproximately 42 per cent of Kenya’s national\nGDP is derived from its natural resource sectors\n(namely agriculture, forestry, fishing, tourism,\nwater supply and energy). The services sector,\n(which includes transport and communication,\nwholesale and retail trade, financial and other\nservices) accounts for about half of GDP. The\nindustry sector (manufacturing, construction,\nmining\nand\nquarrying)\ncontributes\nthe\nremaining 10 per cent.63\n\nThe informal sub-sector (also known as ‘Jua\nKali’) accounts for about 80 per cent of total\nrecorded employment.64 The sector covers all\nunregulated\nsmall-scale\nactivities\nlargely\nundertaken\nby\nthose\nself-employed.\nAn\nestimated 10 million people were engaged in\nthe informal sector in 2012, up from 6 million\nand 9 million in 2004 and 2010, respectively.65\nThe\ninformal\nsub-sector\nis\ngenerally\ncharacterised by low productivity, vulnerability\nof employment, and low incomes.66\n\nIn addition to concerns about an expanding\ninformal economy, the labour market is also\nbeset with under-employment. In 2013, Kenya’s\nunemployment was estimated at 36 per cent,\nwith those for youth (15-35 years) constituting\nthe highest, at 61 per cent. The rate of\nunemployment varies across the country, with\nthe highest in the north-eastern regions at\nabout 23 per cent (2012) and the lowest in\nNyanza and the western regions, estimated at\n4.8 per cent and 5.2 per cent (2012),\nrespectively.67\n\n 32\n\nIndustry\nThe\nindustrial\nsector\ncomprises\nthe\nmanufacturing,\nconstruction,\nmining\nand\nquarrying sub-sectors. The contribution of the\nsector to GDP in 2013 was 4.8 per cent for\n\nmanufacturing accelerating from 3.2 per cent in\n2012; 5.5 per cent for construction compared to\n4.8 per cent in 2012; and 7.4 per cent for\nmining and quarrying an increase from 4.1 per\ncent in 2012.68\n\n Figure 18: Industry sector growth rate, Kenya 2004-2012\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\nFigure 18 shows a negative trend line in the\nindustry growth rate between 2004 and 2013.\nThe National Industrialisation Policy Framework\n(2011-2015) attributes this to high capital\ninvestment; intermediate and capital goods\nindustries that are relatively underdeveloped,\nhigh energy costs, and environmental concerns.\nThe sector has experienced a weak enabling\npolicy environment because past industrial\npolicies have been contained in many disparate\npolicy documents that have lacked harmonised\nand clearly defined national industrialisation\npolicy. The sector is also characterised by low\nvalue addition, low employment and low\ncapacity\nutilisation.\nA\nnew\nNational\nIndustrialization Policy (2014) is expected to\nprovide\na\nstronger\nand\nmore\nrobust\ninstitutional\nframework\nwithin\nwhich\nto\nsynchronise and coordinate the various policies,\nstrategies and activities. Expansion of the\nindustrial sector forms a significant part of\nKenya’s economic development strategy. The\nstrategies to achieve this include but are not\nlimited to:69\n\nx Promoting investment and expansion in key\nclimate sensitive agro-processing industries;\nx Becoming a provider of basic manufactured\ngoods\nfor\neastern\nand\ncentral\nAfrica\nconsequently expanding the country’s export\nbase;\nx Supporting local industries that use local raw\nmaterials, and adding value to imports that\ncan then be re-exported.\nClimate change will need to be managed to\nachieve these goals. Historically, the sector has\nbeen adversely affected by extreme weather\nevents such as rains and ensuing floods, which\nhave impacted infrastructure such as roads,\nrailways, buildings and ports. These impacts\nindirectly affect industrial production.70 Low\nrainfall has resulted in low water quantities\nleading to interruptions in electricity supply\n\n 33\n\ngiven that most electricity is hydro-generated.\nIn addition, the cost of electricity rises in times\nof drought as diesel generators are used to\nmake up the shortfall. The availability of\nagricultural raw materials needed by industries\nis also adversely affected by recurring drought.\n\nMining, Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extraction\n\nThe country has economically viable quantities\nof coal, iron ore, fluorspar, titanium gypsum,\nlimestone, soapstone, gemstones, soda ash,\ndiatomite, lead, gold, silicon oxide and marble.\nRecent discoveries of oil, gas and rare earth\nminerals suggest that these will be potentially\nimportant resources for Kenya going forward.\nThe mining and quarrying sector registered a\ngrowth of 7.4 per cent in 2013, a substantial\nincrease from 4.1 per cent in 2012.71 The sector\naccounted for only one per cent of GDP and\nthree per cent of total export earnings in\n2014.72 There has been very little exploitation of\nthese resources, and development of the\nmining and quarrying sector is expected to\nsupport resource based industries such as iron\nand steel, cement, building and construction,\nchemical and ornamental industries, among\nothers. The Oil and other mineral resources\nsub-sector has been identified as an additional\npriority sector under the Economic Pillar of\nVision 2030. Developments and decisions could\nimpact on Kenya’s GHG emission profile, with\nuse of domestic coal expected to increase\nemissions in the electricity supply sector.\nVulnerability to climate change in the subsector depends on the mining method. Surface\nmining might be particularly affected by high\nrainstorms and floods.73\n\nManufacturing\n\nMedium and large industries constitute less\nthan five per cent of the total number of\nenterprises but contribute over 60 per cent of\nthe manufacturing sector’s GDP contribution.\nMicro and small enterprises comprise about 95\nper cent of total enterprises (the informal\nsector) but contribute only about 20 per cent to\nthe manufacturing sector’s GDP contribution.\nFormal employment with medium and large\nindustries grew by five per cent in 2012 while\ninformal employment (discussed above) grew\nby 17 per cent in the same period.74 The subsector GDP growth rate was 4.8 per cent in\n2013, an increase from 3.2 per cent in 2012.\nThe sub-sector is highly import dependent, and\nfaces high energy costs and environmental\nconcerns. The unreliable supply of electricity\nmeans that most manufacturers operate\nstandby or diesel emergency power systems.\nOthers such as cement manufacturers are\nexploring coal as an alternative electricity\nsupply source, which could lead to a rise in GHG\nemissions. The First and Second MTPs both give\nattention to growth and diversification in the\nmanufacturing sub-sectors with the aim of\nincreasing the sector’s contribution to GDP and\nforeign exchange earnings. To achieve this,\nthree\nspecial\neconomic\nzones\ntargeting\nmanufacturing were established in Mombasa,\nKisumu and Lamu. Other planned initiatives\ninclude building clusters for meat and leather\nproducts; a stronger dairy sector; and the\ndevelopment of industrial and SME parks in the\n47 counties that will provide linkages to other\nsectors like agricultural and services. Climate\nchange may affect the sub-sector in a number\nof ways. First, climate change affects primary\nsectors such as Agriculture and in turn prices\nand quality and quantity of manufacturing\ninputs. Second, the supply chain particularly\nlogistics is affected leading to delays and in turn\nincrease in cost of services.\n\nServices\n\nTrade\nThe trade sector is a key driver for the\nachievement of national development goal.\nTrade provides linkages with other sectors by\ncreating markets through which goods and\nservices reach the consumer. The trade sector\nin Kenya operates on two levels: domestic and\ninternational.\n\n 34\n\nDomestic trade encompasses mainly wholesale\nand retail trade, contributing an average 10.1\nper cent to GDP. It accounts for about 16 per\ncent and 60 per cent of recorded formal and\ninformal employment, respectively. Kenya has\nrecorded a rapid growth in wholesale retail and\ndistribution, particularly in the supermarkets\nand hypermarkets which realised a growth of 32\nper cent between 2000 and 2010,75 with some\nof these expanding to regional markets. The\nexponential growth of supermarkets has been\ndriven\nby\nchanging\nconsumer\nlifestyles,\nincreased urbanisation, and economic growth.76\n\nInternational Trade: Kenya’s external trade is\nhighly skewed towards agricultural commodity\nexports. The value of total merchandise exports\nwas 45 per cent in 2013 while imports were\n81.1 per cent in the same year.77 A high\npercentage of imports over exports has led to a\nwidening of the country’s trade balance. Most\nof the imports are capital goods or raw\nmaterials (e.g. petroleum products, motor\nvehicles, electric equipment, food, metals and\nplastics) for industrial production. The exports\nconsist\nmostly\nof\nagricultural\nproducts\nparticularly\ntea,\ncoffee\nand\nhorticultural\nproduce. The East African Community, the\ncountry’s largest market, accounts for about 27\nper cent of Kenya’s total exports, followed by\nAsia and Europe.78 The country also exports\nclothing and apparel to the United States\nthrough the African Growth and Opportunity\nAct (AGOA). The export base has remained\nlargely the same since Independence; inferring\nthat the country has been unsuccessful in\ndiversifying the export base. To reduce the\ntrade balance and diversify its export base the\nGoK is actively seeking to enlarge export market\nby integrating external trade as part of foreign\npolicy.\n\nThe trade sector depends on services and\nproducts offered by other sectors such as\nenergy, agriculture and transport. The sector is\nvulnerable to climate change, subject to\nchanges in rainfall reliability and extreme\nweather events such as drought, floods. Climate\nchange impacts affect yields, production costs,\nprices, and, in macroeconomic terms, Kenya’s\ntrade balance. Climate change also affects the\nvalue\nchain\nparticularly\nwarehouse\nand\ntransport facilities (road, rail, sea). Transport\ninfrastructure suffered substantial damage in\nthe 1997 -1998 El-Niño rains which caused\neconomic losses of US$ one billion mainly from\nreduced trade activities.79\n\nTourism\nKenya has a wide diversity of natural assets,\nincluding over 500 km of year-round warm\nsandy coastal beaches, marine ecosystems,\nabundant wildlife, a rich and diverse cultural\nheritage, and Mount Kenya’s glaciers. The\ntourism sector contributes approximately 10\nper cent to overall GDP, making it the third\nmost important sector after agriculture and\nmanufacturing and Kenya’s third largest foreign\nexchange earner after tea and horticulture.80\n\n 35\n\nFigure 19: Tourism numbers\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\nFigure\n19\nshows\ntourist\narrivals\nwere\napproximately 1.5 million in 2013 a decrease\nfrom 1.7 million in 2012. The earnings declined\nfrom KSh. 96 billion in 2012 to KSh. 94 billion in\n2013 (Figure 20). The slowdown in tourist\narrivals in 2013 is attributed to the global\neconomic slowdown, especially in Europe, and\nnegative publicity related to security in the\ncountry. Vision 2030 seeks to position Kenya\namong the top 10 long-haul tourist destinations\nin the world by providing a high-end, unique\nand varied experience for visitors. Internal\ninsecurity and climate change impacts could\npose challenges to achieving this goal.\n\nFigure 20: Tourism earnings\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\n 36\n\nClimate change impacts tourism, which relies on\na natural resource base. The NCCAP showed\nthat climate change may already be affecting a\nwide range of the environmental resources that\nare critical attractions for tourism, such as\nwildlife productivity and biodiversity, and water\nlevels and quality. Noted observed impacts\ninclude a reduction in the volume of the Mara\nRiver (due to climatic variations and the\ndestruction of the Mau catchment) which has\ntaken a toll on migration of wildebeests\nbetween the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania)\nand the Maasai Mara Reserve (Kenya). In\naddition, flash floods have at times rendered\nsome tourist destinations (e.g. Maasai Mara in\n2011) inaccessible due to the destruction of the\nroad infrastructure. Other impacts include\nwildlife human conflicts especially in Northern\nKenya where longer and more frequent\ndroughts have ravaged pastoralist populations\nin recent decades, increasing the pressure on\nthe limited resources available, which have to\nbe shared with wildlife.81 Increases in deaths in\nwildlife populations from infectious diseases.\nAre impacted by climate change Birds and\nmammals have been the worst affected, with\nclimate change blamed for the sudden mass\ndeath of flamingos around Lake Nakuru in the\nRift Valley in 2006. 82\n\nInformation Communications and Technology\n(ICT)\nInformation and Communication Technology\n(ICT) has been identified as a key enabler to the\nattainment of the goals and aspirations of the\nVision 2030, helping to transform Kenya into a\nknowledge and information based economy by\nenabling access to quality, affordable and\nreliable ICT services in the country. The\nGovernment has undertaken various measures\naimed at developing the ICT sector, such as\nputting in place a national broadband strategy.\n\nThe growth in ICT-enabled services has opened\na new window for Kenya. The Vision 2030\nidentified Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) –\nIT enabled - as a priority sector. By 2012 Kenya\n\nhad witnessed growth of key BPO companies\nsuch as KenCall, Safaricom, Kentech and\nHorizon.83 Growth has also been witnessed in\nother related industries such as computer\nhardware manufacturing and the acquisition\nand use of computers, mobile phones and\ntelevision sets. ICT growth has led to computers\nand the internet being common across\nbusinesses in all sectors, with mobile phones in\nparticular becoming an essential part of Kenya’s\npopulation daily lives.\n\nICT has been one of the main drivers of Kenya’s\neconomic growth over the last decade. Since\n2000, ICT has been responsible for 0.9 of the 3.7\nper cent annual GDP growth, and for all of\nKenya’s GDP per capita growth (World Bank).\nThe ICT sub-sector is expected to contribute\nover 10 per cent to GDP by 2017. To achieve\nthis goal, the GoK is implementing various\ninitiatives that include improving universal\naccess to IT, promotion of BPOs, capacity\nbuilding, development of digital content, roll\nout of e-government services, establishment of\nan information technology (IT) knowledge\nbased\ncentre\n(Konza\nTechno\nCity)\nand\npromotion of ICT-based industries.\n\nFrom a climate change perspective ICT has an\nimportant role to play in the development of\ncapacity for adaptation and mitigation.84 For\nadaptation ICT can facilitate the processes of\nknowledge\nintegration\nand\nlearning.\nAn\nexample is the Kilimo Salama partnership\nbetween Syngenta Foundation, UAP Insurance\nand Safaricom that offers insurance policies to\nfarmers who plant on as little as one acre of\nland to shield them from significant financial\nlosses when drought or excess rain negatively\nimpact their harvests. Payments to farmers are\nmade through a mobile enabled platform\n(known as MPesa). ICTs could play an important\nmitigation role through “smart” applications\nsuch as smart metering to promote energy\nefficiency. Additionally ICT growth is expected\nto lead to increased electricity demand and\ndisposal challenges will result from a high rate\n\n 37\n\nof obsolete ICT equipment due to technological\nchange.\n\nTransport\nKenya’s rapidly growing\ntransport sector\naccounts for about 10 per cent of GDP.85 Vision\n2030 identifies transport is a key enabler of\nsustainable growth. Reliable and efficient road,\nrail, air and water transport infrastructure\nfacilitates smooth and faster movement of\ngoods and services and national and regional\nintegration. This, boosts trade within and across\nKenyan\nborders,\npromotes\neconomic\ndevelopment, and contributes to poverty\nreduction and wealth creation. .\n\nThe sector has seen significant enhancements\nto improve the movement of people and goods,\nincluding the building of the Nairobi-Thika\nsuperhighway;\nthe\nmodernising\nof\nthe\nMombasa-Nairobi highway; expanding the\ninternational airport in Nairobi, upgrading of\nthe port of Mombasa; developing a port in\nLamu; and upgrading the railway track between\nMombasa and Nairobi.\n\nThe road transport, subsector has experienced\nsignificant growth, with the vehicle population\n(excluding motorcycles) having increased from\n600,000 in 2000 to 2.2 million in 2013. The high\ngrowth of registered vehicles in Nairobi,\ncoupled with underdeveloped infrastructure\nhas led to severe traffic congestion, especially\nduring the extended peak hours, contributing to\nlocal air pollution and resultant health impacts\nand significant economic losses as much time\nand fuel is spent in the traffic congestion. To\nreduce traffic congestion in Nairobi, the\ngovernment has developed plans to introduce a\nMass Rapid Transport (MRTS) system that\nincludes both a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system\ncomplemented by commuter rail,\n\nAn estimated 47 per cent of Nairobi residents\nand the majority of rural residents rely on\ntransport by foot. Public transport services are\ncomparably expensive or\nin\nsome case\ninadequate to meet demand, and private cars\nare out of the financial reach of the majority of\ncitizens.86 Public transport is relatively under-\n\ndeveloped and is dominated by minibuses\n(matatus). The government has identified the\nmobility needs of Kenya’s rural inhabitants and\nhas stated its commitment to the promotion of\nIntermediate Means of Transport (IMTs) as a\nstrategy for poverty alleviation.\n\nThe vast majority of freight transport, including\ntransit freight headed to other countries, is\nserved by trucks. About 30 per cent of the cargo\nhandled at the port of Mombasa is transit cargo\ndestined for such countries as Uganda, Rwanda\nand Burundi. Railway transport of freight is\nexpected to increase with the construction of a\nstandard gauge railway line linking Mombassa\nto Malaba in Uganda; and development of a\nnew transport corridor linking Lamu Port with\nSouth Sudan and Ethiopia. Most petroleum\nproducts are transported from Mombasa to the\nhinterland via a pipeline.\n\nInternational and domestic air transport has\nbeen growing and plays a key role in supporting\nsome of Kenya’s leading foreign exchange\nearners, namely tourism and horticulture.\nThe transport sector is a significant and growing\ncontributor of greenhouse gas emissions. The\nNCCAP reported that emissions from the sector\nare expected to triple between 2010 and 2030,\nfrom a baseline of six million tonnes of CO2equivalent in 2010. The road-subsector is the\nmain source of emissions, responsible for about\n99 per cent of emissions from non-aviation\ntransport.87 Rail systems improvements and\ndevelopment of an MRT in Nairobi are\nmitigation actions that will improve road safety\nand facilitate regional trade.\nThe transport sector is also impacted by climate\nchange, including heavy rains and sea level rise.\nDue to the importance of transport in the\ndevelopment of Kenya and the region, and as\nrecommended in the NCCAP, Kenya will aim to\nmainstream\nclimate\nchange\ninto\nthe\ndevelopment of port facilities, roads, railways\n\n 38\n\nand bridges to account for rising sea levels,\nflooding and the increased occurrence of\nextreme weather events. Addressing climate\nchange in the in the transport sector means\nworking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nwhile encouraging development of transport\ninfrastructure that accounts for flooding,\nextreme weather events and other effects of\nclimate change.\n\nAGRICULTURE PROFILE\n\nThe agricultural sector directly contributes\nabout 25.4 per cent of Kenya’s GDP88 and\nanother 27 per cent indirectly via linkages to\nagro-based industries and the service sector,\ngiving an overall 52 per cent contribution to\nKenya’s GDP. The crops (horticulture, food\ncrops and industrial/cash crops), livestock and\nfisheries subsectors are the main components\nof\nthe\nagricultural\nsector,\nrespectively\ncontributing about 78 per cent, 20 per cent and\n2 per cent of agricultural GDP.89 Growth of the\nnational economy is highly correlated to growth\nand\ndevelopment\nin\nagricultural\nsector,\nindicating the sector’s importance for the\nstimulation of overall economic growth (Figure\n21). Agriculture is the primary source of\nlivelihoods for the majority of Kenyans,\naccounting for 18 per cent and 60 per cent of\nthe formal and total employment respectively.\nIt accounts for 65 per cent of Kenya’s total\nexports.90\n\nAreas of high to medium agricultural potential\n(food crop production, cash crops and dairy\nfarming) cover less than 15 per cent of land\narea and supporting about 80 per cent of the\ncountry’s population (NEMA, 2010). Population\nincrease and scarcity of land in the high to\nmedium production areas has led to subdivision\nof land resulting in small uneconomic farms that\ncannot be run sustainably. Farming in the\ncountry is largely small-scale, with 75 to 80 per\ncent of total agricultural production from rainfed farms that average 0.2 to 3 hectares in\nsize.91 The problem is expected to increase with\npopulation growth.\n\nThe crops subsector includes maize, rice,\nwheat, sorghum, potatoes, cassava, vegetables\nand beans. Kenya’s agriculture is 98% rain-fed\nand predominantly small-scale, especially in the\nmedium to high-potential areas. Changes in\nprecipitation either in quantity and/or timing\nhave a great impact on production. Limited\nrainfall also contributes to the production\npressures, which are compounded by high input\ncosts especially fertilizers, poor marketing\nchains, low level of mechanisation and high\ntransport costs.. Production of the main food\ncrops – maize, wheat and rice – has generally\nbeen\nbelow\nthe\ncountry’s\nconsumption\nrequirements\nthus\ncontributing\nto\nfood\ninsecurity.92\n\nThe key cash crops in Kenya are tea, coffee,\nsugar cane, pyrethrum, and tobacco. Tea is one\nof the leading foreign exchange earners in the\ncountry. The horticulture industry is the second\nmost important foreign exchange earner. Its\nproducts include cut flowers, vegetables, fruits,\nnuts, herbs and spices.\n\nThe livestock subsector, including beef, dairy,\nsheep and goats, camel, poultry and pigs, plays\nan important economic and socio-cultural role\nin many Kenyan communities. Dairy cattle are\nmainly kept in the medium to high-rainfall\nareas. Beef is produced on rangelands with\ndairy cattle culls contributing significantly to\nsupply. Kenya ranks second in the East Africa\nregion after Sudan in both animal product yields\nand value.93 Sheep and goats play a key role in\nthe food security and incomes of pastoral\nhouseholds due to their short generation\nintervals, high adaptability and versatile feeding\nhabits. Pig rearing has withstood periodic\nfluctuations\nand\nis\nnow\nrelatively\nwell\nestablished. Camels are reared mainly in the\narid areas, and their high versatility in drought\nperiods means their rearing is gradually\n\n 39\n\nextending to the South Rift region and is\nexpected to expand to other parts of the\ncountry.\n\nProduction in the fisheries subsector is fairly\nminimal\nwith\naquaculture\ncommercial\nenterprises increasingly taking shape.\n\nFigure 21: Agricultural GDP Growth Rate vs. National GDP Growth Rate (% change), 1968-2012\n\nSource: World Bank, 2014\nThe agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to\nclimate change. Growth rates in the agricultural\nsector are correlated with flood and drought\nevents, and historically negative growth indices\nhave been associated with extreme weather\nevents (see Figure 22). A study by the\nAdaptation to Climate Change and Insurance\n(ACCI) project94 reported the occurrence of 41\nflood events and 12 drought events between\n1970 and 2013, noting that flooding tends to be\nmore frequent but more localized, while\ndrought is less frequent but more systemic. The\ncycle of drought is becoming shorter, more\nfrequent and more intense.\n\nAgricultural sector productivity is directly\ninfluenced by emerging and projected changes\nin\nclimatic\npatterns,\nincluding\nincreased\nvariability of seasonal rains. National trends\nindicate an increase in temperature and highly\nvariable rainfall where first season rains are\nlower in amounts and more variable, while\nsecond season rains have increased in amount.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of the extreme\nweather and climate events such as drought\nand floods are also on the increase. These\nweather events result in increased soil erosion,\ndeforestation, loss of soil fertility and reduced\nproductivity. The increasing frequency and\nmagnitude of extreme weather events has\ncontributed to a decline in the annual growth\nrate in agricultural “value added” (Government\nof Kenya, 2014)95.\n\n 40\n\nFigure 22: Agricultural growth index and major extreme events in Kenya 1980 – 2012\n\nSource: World Bank, 2014\n\nENERGY PROFILE\n\nEnergy is a critical component for the Kenyan\neconomy and its population’s standard of living.\nVision 2030 identifies energy as a key\nfoundation and one of the “enablers” upon\nwhich the economic, social and political pillars\nwill be built. The GoK recognises that the\nsuccessful implementation of its flagship\nprojects will greatly depend on supply of\nadequate, reliable, clean and affordable energy.\nAs a result the demand for electricity will\nincrease as the numerous economic activities\nimplemented and new county governments\ntake shape. In particular will be the energy\nintensive activities such as mining; production\nof iron and steel products; irrigation of large\ntracts of land for food security; operation of\npetroleum pipelines for both crude and refined\nfuel oils amongst others. The level and intensity\nof commercial energy use in the country will\ncertainly be a key indicator of the degree of its\neconomic growth and development.\n\nKenya faces serious constraints in energy\nsupply, including low access to modern energy\nservices, high cost of energy, irregular supply\nand high cost of energy investments96. Biomass\n(wood fuel, charcoal, and agricultural waste),\npetroleum and electricity are the main sources\nof energy in the country. They account for 76\nper cent, 21 per cent, and 3 per cent,\nrespectively, of the country’s total energy\nconsumption (Figure 23).\n\nWood fuel is the most important source of\nenergy in the country. About 80 per cent of the\npopulation depends on it for their domestic\nneeds, providing 90 per cent and 85 per cent of\nrural\nand\nurban\nhouseholds’\nenergy\nrequirement, respectively.97 Current wood\nharvesting\nis\nunsustainable\nleading\nto\ndeforestation and land degradation in the\ncountry.98\n\n 41\n\nFigure 23: Kenya Energy Sources\n\nSource: Derived from data based on Ellis K. et al, 2013\n\nPetroleum is imported and mainly used in the\ntransport, commercial and industrial sectors.\nKenya’s import of petroleum accounted for\nabout 16 per cent of the total import bill in\n2012 and 17.9 per cent in 2013 and consumed\nabout 31 per cent and 55 per cent of the\ncountry’s foreign exchange earnings from\nmerchandise exports in 2012 and 2013,\nrespectively.99 Kenya currently relies on imports\nfor all petroleum requirements. However, with\nthe discovery of oil in the country, this trend is\nexpected to change with time.\n\nIn 2013, electricity in Kenya was generated\nmainly from hydropower, geothermal and\nthermal sources. Figure 25 and Figure 26 show\nthe electricity generation by sources in 2013.\nThe\ntotal\ninstalled\nelectricity\ngeneration\ncapacity in Kenya was 7,890 GWh.\n\nFigure 24 shows the electricity generation by\nsources for the period 2004 to 2013.\nHydropower, the main source of electricity,\nreduced considerably in 2009 due to reduced\nrainfall and reduced hydrology in the main\ncatchment areas of the major rivers on which\ngenerating dams are constructed. This was\naggravated by the destruction of water\ncatchment areas leading to dry water levels and\nsiltation in the dams.100 Droughts and declines\nin rainfall have led to lower reservoir levels\nreducing hydropower production.101\n\nGeothermal power is increasingly becoming a\nkey player and may take over from hydropower\nas the leading source of electricity in the\ncountry. Other renewable energy sources such\nas wind, solar and biomass (cogeneration) are\nalso becoming important alternative sources of\nelectricity although these remain insignificant in\nthe country’s overall energy mix. Programmes\nfor their increased development and use have\nbeen formulated such as the revised Feed-inTariff (FiT) policy in 2010.\n\nThe electricity mix is projected to change in\norder to drive the achievement of Vision 2030\nand in light of recent resource discoveries and\nlong-term plans. Kenya’s National Energy Policy\n2014, which has been formulated within the\nframework\nof\nVision\n2030,\nconsiders\ndiversification of electricity sources. Through it,\n\n 42\n\nthe GoK has developed a plan to raise electricity\ngeneration capacity by an additional 5,000 MW\nfrom the current 1,664 MW that will total to\n6,762 MW by 2016. The new capacity will\nmainly be developed from geothermal 1,646\nMW, natural gas 1,050 MW, wind 630 MW and\ncoal 1,920 MW. This new plan will not only\nimprove Kenya’s energy security but also\nreduce\ndependency\non\nhydropower\nand\nimported fuels.\n\nOnly about 25 per cent of the total population\nin Kenya are connected to the grid.102 About 60\nper cent of all the generated electricity is\nconsumed by the commercial and industrial\nsectors and only about 25 per cent is used by\nhouseholds.103\n\nFigure 24: Electricity generation sources for the period 2004 -2013\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\nThe key challenges in the electricity sub-sector\nin the country include:\nx Inadequate power generation capacity\nx Major power outages that cost the country up\nto two per cent of GDP and that have led to\nabout 70 per cent of the country’s firms\ninvesting in their own generation compared\nto only 10 per cent of firms in South Africa104\nx High electricity costs\n\nClimate change will exacerbate the situation, as\nprolonged drought leads to a reduction of water\nlevels in dams. The low October to December\n2013 rainfall resulted in reduced water levels in\nthe hydroelectric power generation dams,\nleading to power shortages and electricity\nrationing.105 Flooding has led to siltation of\ndams, and the resultant reduction of water\nstorage\nand\nhydroelectricity\ngeneration\ncapacity.106 The adverse effects of climate\nvariability and change on hydropower are\nprojected to grow.107\n\nHEALTH PROFILE\n\nVision 2030 emphasizes making progress on\nuniversal access to health care, prevention and\nprimary health care, clean water, management\nof communicable disease, maternal and child\nhealth, and non-communicable diseases. It also\nseeks\nto\ninvest\nin\nmedical\nresearch,\npharmaceutical production and health tourism\nas a means of diversifying external revenue\nsources and serve as a regional hub for health\nservices. The GoK allocates about 4.6 per cent\n\n 43\n\nof the national budget to health, which remains\nbelow the Abuja target of 15 per cent.108\n\nKenya has made progress to improve health\ncare especially in tackling communicable\ndiseases such as HIV-AIDs, tuberculosis and\nmalaria. About 52 per cent of Kenya’s\npopulation has access to basic health services\nwithin 5 km, 109 although significant disparities\nin service availability exist between rural and\nurban areas. The ASALs remain the most\ndisadvantaged in the provision of health\nservices especially, the distribution of health\nfacilities and availability of health personnel.\nMortality rates remain high. The main causes of\nmortality include: HIV/AIDS (29.3 per cent),\nperinatal conditions (9 per cent), lower\nrespiratory\ninfections\n(8.1\nper\ncent),\ntuberculosis (TB) (6.3 per cent), diarrhoea (6.0\nper cent) and malaria at (5.8 per cent).110\n\nClimate change will negatively impact progress\nin the health sector. For example, rising\ntemperatures and erratic rainfall may lead to an\nincreased spread of various diseases, such as\nmalaria because of an increase in mosquito\nbreeding habitats. Historical incidences of\nincreased temperature and rainfall, such as\nduring the El Niño events of 1982 to 1983 and\n1997\nto\n1998,\ncoincided\nwith\nmalaria\noutbreaks111 In addition the reduction of surface\nwater will increase the exploitation of ground\nwater which will lead to more people suffering\nfrom diseases such as fluorosis, diabetes and\nhypertension.112 This is because ground water in\nsome areas such as the Rift Valley have been\nfound to contain specific compounds such as\nhigh fluoride levels, high sodium levels and low\nchromium levels which are directly associated\nwith the increased emergence of these\ndiseases.113\n\nThe environment, water, health and sanitation\nsectors are interconnected. Climate change\nimpacts in the environment and water sectors\nalso affect the health and sanitation sector; and\nactions in these sectors need to be looked at\nholistically in order to avoid mal-adaptation.\n\nEDUCATION PROFILE\n\nKenya has had a remarkable increase in access\nand participation rates in the education sector\nas reflected in indicators of the enrolment rate\nand gender parity across all levels of education.\nHowever, disparities still exist, and access and\nparticipation rates remain below national\naverage in the ASALs. The disparities at county\nlevel are further aggravated by inefficient\nutilisation of available resources, as manifested\nthrough teacher absenteeism and limited\nemphasis on monitoring of actual performance.\n\nPrimary\neducation\nrecorded\nthe\nhighest\nprogress, while access rates at pre-primary,\nsecondary and tertiary education remain below\nthe sub-Saharan average of 7%. Learning\noutcomes at the secondary school are still\nweak, with about 70 per cent of candidates\nfailing to achieve the minimum grade for\nadmission to university. Equally, the literacy\nlevel has remained low.\n\nThe GoK has developed plans to address issues\nrelated to access, equity, quality, relevance,\nservice\ndelivery,\ncurriculum,\nteacher\ndevelopment and management, as well as\ntraining in the areas of technology and\nentrepreneurial skill development.\n\n 44\n\nTable 5: National education indicators\n\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\nPre-Primary GER\n60.6\n60.9\n65.6\n66.3\nPre-Primary NER\n49\n50\n52.4\n53.3\nPrimary GER\n110\n109.8\n115\n115.8\nPrimary NER\n92.9\n91.4\n95.7\n95.3\nSecondary GER\n45.3\n47.8\n48.8\n49.3\nMinistry of Education Budget (% )\n16\n15.6\n13.5\n11.4\nPrimary teacher/ Student ratio (public)\n1:52\n1:54\n1:57\n1:56\nSecondary teacher/ Student ratio (public)\n1:30\n1:31\n1:31\n1:32\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\nINSTITUTIONAL PROFILE\n\nThis section provides information on GoK\ninstitutions, policies, plans, strategies and\ninitiatives that provide a governance framework\nfor implementing climate change responses.114\n\nThe Government of Kenya is developing a policy\nand institutional framework to guide the\ncountry toward a low carbon climate resilient\ndevelopment pathway. Kenya’s governance\nstructure has been informed by the global and\nregional commitments and obligations, such as\nUNFCCC (1992), Africa’s African Climate Change\nStrategy (2011) and East Africa’s Climate\nChange Policy, Strategy and Master Plan (2011).\n\nThe first national policy document on climate\nchange, the National Climate Change Response\nStrategy (NCCRS), has improved understanding\nof the issue and has guided policy decisions\nsince its launch in 2010. To operationalize the\nNCCRS, Kenya prepared the National Climate\nChange Action Plan 2013-2017 (NCCAP). The\naction plan is delivered through eight subcomponents:\nx Long-term National Low Carbon Climate\nResilient Development Pathway\nx Enabling Policy and Regulatory Framework\n\nx Adaptation Analysis and Prioritisation\nx Mitigation\nx Technology\nx National\nPerformance\nand\nBenefit\nMeasurement\nx Knowledge\nManagement\nand\nCapacity\nDevelopment\nx Finance\n\nThe Government of Kenya has moved to\nimplement a number of actions in the NCCAP,\nincluding improved drought management and\npromotion of renewable energy. The Ministry of\nPlanning and Devolution (MOPD) has included\nindicators to track progress in mainstreaming\nclimate change in its Second Handbook of\nNational Reporting. A Climate Change Bill is\nexpected to be enacted into law in 2015. This\nBill includes establishment of a National Climate\nChange Council that has responsibility for\ncoordination\nof\nclimate\nchange\nactions,\nincluding mainstreaming climate change in\nnational and county budgets, plans and\nprograms. A draft Climate Change Framework\nPolicy and a National Policy on Climate Finance\nare\nexpected\nto\nprovide\nguidance\non\nmainstreaming to national departments and\ncountry governments.\n\n 45\n\nNational Policies and Legislation\nOther relevant national policies and legislation\nthat\ncontain\nmeasures\nthat\nenable\nmainstreaming of climate change are included\nin Table 6 below.\n\nTable 6: Key National Policies and Legislation\nPolicies\nMeasures to mainstream climate change\nConstitution of Kenya\n(2010)\nA clean and health environment (Articles 42, 69 and 70) is a fundamental right\nunder the Bill of Rights, providing a rationale for the formulation of adaptation and\nmitigation legislation, policies and strategies. The Constitution establishes the right\nto food security while emphasizing sustainable and productive management of land\nand natural resources, such as a goal of tree cover of 10 per cent of the country’s\nland area.\nKenya Vision 2030\nThe national development blueprint has many plans and programs that factor in\naspects of adaptation and mitigation. Its flagship projects include irrigation\nexpansion, geothermal development and slum rehabilitation.\nNational Policy for the\nSustainable Development of\nNorthern Kenya and other\nArid Lands\nFocuses on climate resilience requiring government to find solutions to address\nclimate challenges and to come up with measures to manage drought and\nstrengthen livelihoods. The establishment of the National Drought Management\nAuthority (NDMA), the National Disaster Contingency Fund and the Council for\nPastoralists education are provided for in the policy.\nNational Disaster\nManagement Policy, 2012\nMainstreams disaster risk reduction in the country’s development initiatives, and\naims to increase and sustain resilience of vulnerable communities to hazards.\nNational Environment Policy\n(2013)\nProvide a framework for an integrated approach to planning and sustainable\nmanagement of Kenya’s environment and natural resources.\nEnvironmental Management\nand Coordination Act (1999)\nProvides the framework for the management of the environment, including the\nestablishment of NEMA which is a regulator in matters of environment, the\nDesignated National Authority (DNA) for the CDM and the National Implementing\nEntity (NIE) for the Adaptation Fund.\nKenya Forestry Master Plan\n(1995-2020)\n\nProvides an overarching framework for forestry development and recognises the\nenvironmental role of forests including water values, biodiversity values, climate\nchange values through carbon sequestration and other environmental services.\nSecond National\nEnvironment Action Plan\n(2009-2013)\nProvides a broad framework for the coordination of environmental activities by the\nprivate sector and Government to guide the course of development activities, with a\nview to integrating environment and development for better management of\nresources.\nNational Water Master Plan\n2030\nAssesses and evaluates the availability and vulnerability of country’s water\nresources up to around 2050 taking climate change into consideration.\nWater Act (2002)\nProvides the overall governance of the sector, and recognises the climate change\nimplications on health, sanitation and water.\nAgricultural Sector\nDevelopment Strategy, 20102020\nProvides the framework for transforming agriculture into a modern and\ncommercially viable sector. Notes that addressing food security will require\naddressing the challenge of over-dependence on rain fed agriculture.\nEnergy Policy and Act (2004)\n\nEncourages implementation of indigenous renewable energy sources to enhance\nthe country’s electricity supply capacity. The policy is implemented through the\nEnergy Act of 2006 (revised 2014), which provides for mitigation of climate change,\nthrough energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy.\nThe Feed in Tariffs (FiTs)\nPolicy (2008,revised 2012)\nPromotes generation of electricity from renewable sources. It applies to\ngeothermal, wind, small hydro, solar and biomass.\nIntegrated National\nTransport Policy (2010)\nProvides for transport solutions that have relevance to climate change mitigation.\n\n 46\n\nLead Government institutions for climate\nchange\n\nTable 7 shows the lead institutions and\nresponsibilities with regard to climate change at\nthe time of preparing the Second National\nCommunication for Kenya\nTable 7: Lead institutions and responsibilities with regard to Climate Change\nMinistry/Agency\nDescription\nMinistry of Environment,\nNatural Resources and Regional\nDevelopment Authorities\n(MENDDRA)\n\nThe mandate of the Ministry is to monitor, protect, conserve and\nmanage the environment and natural resources through sustainable\nexploitation for socio-economic development aimed at eradication of\npoverty, improving living standards and ensuring that a clean\nenvironment is sustained now and in the future. The Ministry is also\nresponsible for making policy on climate change and for the coordination\nof climate change response in the country. The National Climate Change\nSecretariat (NCCS) is a department of the Ministry and spearheads the\ndevelopment and implementation of climate change policies, strategies\nand action plans. These include: National Climate Change Action Plan\n(2013-2017) which implements the National Climate Change Response\nStrategy (2010). The Ministry is the national focal point for the UNFCCC.\nIn addition to the NCCS, the Ministry comprises of the following\ndepartments and institutions, which also play a role in the national\nclimate change response:\n• National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) – This is a\nstate corporation established by the Environmental Management\nand Coordination Act No.8 of 1999 whose mandate is to supervise\nand coordinate all matters related to the environment. With regard\nto climate change, NEMA serves as the Designated National\nAuthority for the Clean Development Mechanism and the National\nImplementing Entity for the Adaptation Fund. NEMA is also the\ntechnical entity that produces the National Communications to the\nUNFCCC\n• Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD)\n• Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing (DRSRS)\nMinistry of Devolution and\nPlanning\nThis Ministry is responsible for national development planning,\nleadership and coordination of devolution; and associated monitoring\nand evaluation in Kenya. It leads the process to mainstream climate\nchange into the national plans including the 5 year mid-term plans under\nVision2030. It also works with the MENR to analyse the risks and impacts\nof climate change to national development.\nThe National Treasury\nThe Ministry is charged with the responsibility of formulating financial\nand economic policies as well as the management of revenues,\nexpenditures and borrowing by the GoK. In relation to climate change,\nthe Ministry is responsible for the allocation of funds from the exchequer\nand is the National Designated Authority to the Green Climate Fund\nMinistry of Energy and\nPetroleum\nThe Ministry is mandated to facilitate provision of clean, sustainable,\naffordable and secure energy for national development while protecting\nthe environment. The Ministry has a department of renewable energy\n\n 47\n\nand other associated relevant institutions which include: Rural\nElectrification Authority (REA), Geothermal Development Company\n(GDC), Kenya Electricity Generation Company (KENGEN), Kenya Power\nand the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO),\nCentre for Energy Efficiency and Conservation (CEEC).\nMinistry of Agriculture,\nLivestock & Fisheries\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture is mandated to promote and facilitate\nproduction of food, livestock and fisheries and agricultural raw materials\nfor food security and incomes; advance agro-based industries, and\nagricultural exports; and enhance sustainable use of land resources as\nthe basis for agricultural enterprises. Due to the sensitivity of agriculture\nto climate change, the Ministry has established a climate change unit\nthat coordinates climate related issues across the agriculture sector. The\nMinistry is also implementing various climate change programmes and\nprojects.\nNational Council for Science &\nTechnology (NCST)\nThe NCST is an advisory institution on matters of Science,\nTechnology, Innovation and Research in Kenya for national social\neconomic development.\nNational Drought Management\nAuthority (NDMA)\nEstablished by Legal Notice in late 2011, the core mandate of the NMDA\nis to exercise general supervision and coordination over all matters\nrelating to drought management in Kenya, and to be the principal\ninstrument of Government in ensuring the delivery of all the policies and\nstrategies that relate to drought management and climate change\nadaptation.\nClimate Change Units/Desk\nOffices\nClimate Change Units and Desk Offices have been established in most\nGovernment of Kenya institutions including: Kenya Agricultural Research\nInstitute (KARI), Kenya Forest Service (KFS), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS),\nand Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI).\nCounty Governments\nThe Kenya Constitution 2010 establishes 47 constitutionally autonomous\ncounty governments that have defined spheres of power and functions.\nThe County Governments Act, 2012 states that a county government shall\nplan within a framework that integrates economic, physical, social,\nenvironmental and spatial planning, and protect and develop natural\nresources in a manner that aligns national and county government\npolicies. Climate change is a function of the national and county\ngovernment and requires concurrent jurisdiction across both levels.\nVarious functions assigned to county governments are integral to\nfulfilment of actions required to address climate change.\nSource: Kenya's National Climate Change Action Plan\n\nThe\nNational\nEnvironment\nManagement\nAuthority\n(NEMA),\na\nsemi-autonomous\ngovernment agency in the MENR, is responsible\nfor the overall coordination and management of\nthe process of preparation of Kenya’s national\ncommunications.\nNEMA\nwas\nestablished\nunder\nthe\nEnvironmental Management and Co-ordination\nAct No. 8 of 1999 (EMCA) in 1999. The EMCA\nmandates the Authority to exercise general\nsupervision and coordination over all matters\nrelating to the environment and to be the\nprincipal instrument of the GoK in the\nimplementation of all policies relating to the\nenvironment. NEMA’s work is guided by\nprovisions in Articles 42 and 70 of Kenya’s\nConstitution 2010. Article 42 states that every\nperson has the right to clean and healthy\nenvironment. Article 70 provides the right to\nhave environment protected for the benefit of\npresent\nand\nfuture\ngenerations\nthrough\nlegislative and other measures. In addition\n\n 48\n\nNEMA work links closely with the Vision 2030\ngoal of a clean secure and sustainably managed\nenvironment. NEMA has been assigned leading\nroles in the flagship projects of Waste\nmanagement;\nEducation\nfor\nSustainable\nDevelopment (ESD); securing wildlife corridors\nthrough the EIA process; clean development\nmechanisms\namong\nother\nprojects.\nThe\nAuthority also advises the GoK on various\nMultilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs)\nthat should be ratified, domesticated and\nimplemented for the benefits of the country. In\naddition the Authority chairs the interministerial committee overseeing performance\ncontracts required by GoK from the Ministries\nDepartments and Agencies (MDAs) to report on\nEnvironmental sustainability on a quarterly\nbasis and annually.\nThe above platforms strengthen NEMA’s\nmandate as the lead institution in spearheading\nthe national communications process and\nconducting inter-ministerial coordination.\nThe Second National Communication (SNC)\nwork has built on the work done under the First\nNational Communication (FNC), NCCRS, NCCAP,\nthe draft NAP and Kenya’s Vision 2030. Figure\n25 below shows the current institutional set up\nfor the preparation of the SNC. The future\nproposed\ninstitutional\nframework\nfor\naddressing Climate Change, including meeting\ninternational commitments under the UNFCCC\nis addressed under the Climate Change Bill,\n2014.\n\nFigure 25: Structure for Preparation of SNC\n\nThe NEMA Project Management Team (PMT) is\ncomposed of a Project Coordinator and Project\nSteering Committee chaired by the NEMA\nDirector General or his appointee.

The annual emissions per\ncapita (without LULUCF) gradually decreased\nfrom 1.5 tCO2e in 1996 to 1.3 tCO2e in 1998,\nwhere it stabilised until 2012. A similar trend\nwas observed for the GHG emissions per capita\nincluding LULUCF.\n\nThe challenge of climate change is likely to\ncompound these trends. There is increasing\nevidence that climate change is directly\naffecting\nthe\nsocial,\neconomic\nand\nenvironmental status of the country. The World\nBank affirms that “poverty and vulnerability to\nclimate change remain the most critical\ndevelopment challenges facing Kenya.”115\n\n50\n\nTable 8: National economic indicators\nIndicator\n1996\n1998\n2012\n\nPopulation (millions)\n28\n28.7\n41.8\nAnnual GHG emissions per capita\n(excluding LULUCF) in tCO2\n1.5\n1.3\n1.3\nAnnual GHG emissions per capita\n(including LULUCF) in tCO2\n2.0\n1.9\n1.8\nEstimated share of informal sector in\nGDP(percentage)\n6.1\n8.2\n25\nRelevant area (square kilometres)\n582,646\n582,646\n582,646\nShare of manufacturing industry in\nGDP (percentage)\n13.8\n16\n8.9\nShare of services in GDP (percentage)\n59\n60.2\n48\nShare of agriculture in GDP\n(percentage)\n25\n26\n26\nLand area used for agricultural\npurposes (million square kilometres)\n52,047\n52,047\n52,047\nUrban population as percentage of\ntotal\n29\n33.6\n32 (2012)\nLivestock population (000)\n29,961\n29,961\n67,454\nForest area (square kilometres)\n20,310\n20,310\n20,509\n(2010)\nPopulation in national absolute\npoverty (percentage)\n48\n48.02\n46\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\n59.9 (1989)\n59.5 (1989)\n60.37 (2011)\nLiteracy rate (percentage)\n73.4\n78\n74 (2007)\nSources: 1st NC; Economic Report 2013; 2nd MTP; NCCAP; State of Environment Report 2009; Planning\nCommission, 2007; Kenya National Human Development Report 2013\n\n51\n\nREFERENCES\nAlkire, S., Roche, J.M., Santos, M.E. & Seth, S.\n(2011).

In\nOctober 2002, Kenya submitted their first\ninventory\nwith\nKenya’s\nFirst\nNational\nCommunication (FNC). The FNC inventory was\nprepared for the reference year 1994 in\ncompliance with Articles 4 and 12 of the\nUNFCCC\nand\nin\naccordance\nwith\nthe\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) Guidelines of 1996.\n\nThis chapter presents Kenya’s greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions and removals by sinks for the\nyear 2000, as well as additional years between\n1995 and 2010 in accordance with the\nrecommendation of the Intergovernmental\nPanel\non\nClimate\nChange\n(IPCC).\nThe\ngreenhouse gas Inventory was conducted on an\nindividual sector basis for the Energy; Industrial\nProcesses;\nSolvent\nand\nProduct\nUse;\nAgriculture; Land Use, Land-Use Change and\nForestry (LULUCF); and Waste Sectors. The\ngreenhouse gases included are Carbon Dioxide\n(CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and\npartially fluorinated hydrocarbons (HFCs) not\ncovered under the Montreal Protocol. Indirect\ngreenhouse\ngases\nincluding\nNon-Methane\nVolatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC), Carbon\nMonoxide (CO) Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and\nSulphur Dioxide (SO2) are also reported as they\nhave an important influence on chemical\nreactions in the atmosphere.\n\nThe IPCC Revised 1996 Guidelines for National\nGreenhouse Gas Inventories (Volumes 1, 2 and\n3) and the Good Practice Guidance and\nUncertainty\nManagement\nin\nNational\nGreenhouse Gas Inventories were used as the\nbasis to undertake the necessary calculations on\nGHG Emissions and Removals. The use of these\nIPCC Guidelines for all years fulfils the objective\nof the Conference of the Parties for the use of\n\ncomparable methodologies. In accordance with\nthe\nGuidelines,\nCO2\nemissions\nfrom\nInternational Bunkers and burning of biomass\nare not included in the national totals, but are\nreported separately as Memo Items in the\nInventory.\n\nComplete\ndocumentation\nof\nmethods, activity data and emission factors\nalong with references of all data sources are\nreported in Kenya’s National GHG Inventory\nReport 2010.\n\nThe calculation of emissions was assisted using\nUNFCCC’s Non-Annex I National Greenhouse\nGas Inventory Software (version 1.3.2). Annex A\nof the SNC presents the standard reporting\ntables for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010.\n\nThe chapter starts with energy sector for which\nthe methodology, the activity data, the GHG\nemissions and the indirect GHG emissions are\ndiscussed. The other sectors follow with\ndiscussions under the same topics after which,\nthe\ninventory\ngaps,\nneeds\nand\nrecommendations are presented. The chapter\nthen analyses the key sources, uncertainty and\nimprovements between the FNC and the SNC.\nIt concludes with a summary of the GHG\nemissions and removals.\n\nSUMMARY OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\nAND REMOVALS\n\nThis section provides an overall summary of\ngreenhouse gas emissions for Kenya between\n1995 and 2010. Greenhouse gas emissions are\nexpressed as CO2e (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent)\nby IPCC sectors. The carbon dioxide equivalent\nis calculated using the 100 year global warming\npotentials for specific gases that are identified\nfor use with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines.\n\nFigure 26 and Figure 27 indicates the relative\ncontribution of the four main greenhouse gases\n(i.e., CO2, CH4, N2O and HFCs) to total emissions\nfor each of the inventory years 1995, 2000,\n2005 and 2010.\n\n56\n\nFigure 26: Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions expressed in CO2e Excluding LULUCF (Gg)\n0.0\n10.0\n20.0\n30.0\n40.0\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nEmissions Megatonnes CO2e\nHFC\nN2O\nCO2\nCH4\n\nFigure 27: Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions expressed in CO2e Including LULUCF (Gg)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nEmissions Megatonnes CO2e\nHFC\nN2O\nCH4\nCO2\n\nOverall greenhouse gas emissions in Kenya have\nincreased over the past fifteen years but not at\na rate above the average economic growth of\n3.5% (World Bank, 2014). Average annual\ngrowth in emissions excluding LULUCF was 2.2%\nper year, with LULUCF it was 3.0% per year.\n\nTotal CO2e emissions for the year 2010 are\nestimated to be 48.4 megatons (Mt) without\nthe contribution from LULUCF. This is an\nincrease from 1995 of 13.5 Mt or 38%. With the\nLULUCF sector, total CO2e emissions rise to 69.5\nMt in 2010, an increase from 1995 of 25 Mt or\n56%. Emission growth is primarily driven by\nincreased demand for fossil fuels in the energy\nsector and by increased emissions in the\nLULUCF sector. Energy emissions grew at an\naverage rate of 4.1% per year while LULUCF\n\n57\n\nemissions grew at an average rate of 5.3% per\nyear between 1995 and 2010. Agriculture\nemissions grew much more slowly at an average\nrate of 1.3% per year. Waste and industrial\nprocess emissions account for less than 6% of\noverall emissions and grew at an average\nannual rate of 2.3% and 6.1% respectively\nbetween 1995 and 2010.\nTrends in total CO2e emissions for each IPCC\ncategory for the complete time series 1995 to\n2010 are shown in Figure 28 excluding the\nLULUCF sector. Figure 29 identifies the\nemissions profile with the LULUCF sector.\n\nFigure 28: Greenhouse Gas Emissions in MtCO2e excluding LULUCF (1995-2010)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nWaste\nIndustrial\nProcesses\nEnergy\nAgriculture\n\nFigure 29: Greenhouse Gas Emissions in MtCO2e including LULUCF (1995-2010\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nWaste\nIndustrial\nProcesses\nEnergy\nLULUCF\nAgriculture\nGreenhouse gas emission contributions by\nsector and greenhouse gas are summarized in\nTable 10 for the year 2010.

In the case of biomass fuels\n(firewood, charcoal and agricultural residues),\nCO2 emissions are not accounted for in total\nenergy sector emissions. Renewable fuels do\nnot generate net emissions and emissions\nassociated with the non-renewable part are\nincluded in the Land-Use Change and Forestry\nsector.\n\nCO2 emissions from combustion of fuels\nsupplied\nfor\ninternational\nwater-borne\nnavigation and international aviation (the socalled bunker fuels) are reported in accordance\nwith Decision 17/CP.8, but not accounted for in\ntotal energy sector emissions.\n\nThe Energy sector also includes fugitive\nemissions\nfrom\nfossil\nfuel\nproduction,\ntransportation and processing. In Kenya’s case\nthis includes emissions from the refining of\ncrude oil into petroleum products, as well as,\nNMVOC emission from the storage and\nhandling of crude oil.\n\nKenya did not have primary fossil fuel\nproduction before 2010 but has had an active\nrefinery\nthat\nmanufacturers\nsecondary\npetroleum products from imported crude.\nAdditional fuels for consumption are imported\nincluding coal from South Africa. Demand for\npetroleum fuels has steadily increased since\n2000 at an average annual rate of 3.4%. The\nhighest growth in demand was related to the\ntransportation sector. Electricity generation\nhas also grown at a similar pace over the same\ntimeframe and renewable resources such as\nhydro and geothermal that are not estimated to\ngenerate significant greenhouse gas emissions\nrepresent an average of about 70% of total\ngeneration between 2000 and 2010. However,\nthe electricity generation mix can fluctuate as\nhydro generation has varied substantially in\nrecent years due to unreliable water levels.\n\nThe national consumption of fossil and biomass\nfuels is identified in Table 11. Data on fossil\nfuels was provided primarily by the Ministry of\nEnergy. Estimates of biomass consumption\nwere based on a number of different studies\nand\nare\nconsistent\nwith\nan\nIntegrated\nAssessment of the Energy Policy conducted by\nKamfor Consultants completed in 2006.\n\n59\n\nTable 2: Domestic Consumption of Fuels (1000’s tonnes of product) (1995-2010)\nType\nFuel\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\nPrimary\nFossil Fuels1\nCrude Oil\n1,382.6\n2,043.8\n1,774.0\n1,643.2\n1,598.7\n1,687.7\n1,610.1\n1,551.5\nBit.

Despite Agriculture’s declining\nproportion of the overall economic activity in\nKenya, livestock numbers and crop production\nhave increased. The cattle population has\nincreased marginally by 8% in that time, but\nother livestock populations including sheep,\ngoat and camels have increased by more than\n40%. Production of wheat and maize crops have\nincreased by 64% and 103%, respectively.\n\nAgricultural activities contribute to greenhouse\ngas emissions through a variety of different\nprocesses. CH4 and N2O are the only significant\ngreenhouse gases emitted by the Agriculture\nSector. CH4 emissions arise from enteric\nfermentation\nand\nmanure\nmanagement\nassociated with livestock, as well as, rice\ncultivation and prescribed burning of savannah\nand crop residues. N2O Emissions arise primarily\nfrom synthetic and natural fertilizers (i.e.,\nmanure, crop residues) applied to cultivated\nsoils and are based on IPCC assumptions\n\n67\n\nregarding atmospheric deposition and leaching\nfrom soils. Other N2O emission sources include\nrice cultivation and prescribed burning of\nsavannah and crop residues and are based on\nland areas or production quantities combined\nwith default IPCC emission factors.

The\ndataset that is employed is from the Food and\nAgricultural Organization (FAO) of the United\nNations Global Forest Resource Assessment\n2010 for Kenya. This method is described as\nApproach 1 in the 2003 IPCC Good Practice\nGuidance for LULUCF.\nThe general method for calculating fluxes of CO2\nto or from the atmosphere and biomass carbon\npools is the same as outlined in the 1996\nRevised IPCC Guidelines. These fluxes are\n\n71\n\nestimated using a state and transition model\nthat parameterizes and defines changes in landuse, land-use management and disturbances\nlike wildfire to estimate annual fluxes over a\ntwenty year historic period between 1990 and\n2010. The inventory considers all forests in\nKenya as managed forest where forest\nmanagement is defined as the process of\nplanning and implementing practices for\nstewardship and use of the forest aimed at\nfulfilling relevant ecological, economic and\nsocial functions of the forest.\nThe carbon pools represented in the model are\nconsistent with IPCC Guidelines and include\nabove-ground biomass, below-ground biomass,\nsoil organic matter and the atmosphere. More\ndetail on the modelling is provided in Kenya’s\n2010 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report.\n\nLand Representation and Activity Data\n\nThe FAO Global Forest Resource Assessment for\nKenya\npresents\nland-use\ndata\nthat\nhas\nconsistent representation over a twenty year\ntime period and is complete and covers all of\nthe land area within Kenya. Although the data\nis not country derived or spatially explicit it is\npublicly available and transparent. Land-uses\nidentified can be mapped at a high level to the\nsix IPCC land-use categories (forest land,\ncropland, grassland, wetlands, settlement and\nother land). Land-use types and historic areas\nare presented in Table 22 below.\n\nTable 23: Areas of different land-use categories and State Classifications between 1990 and 2010\nFAO Land-Use\nCategories\nModelling Land-Use\nState Classifications\n(IPCC Class)\nArea (000 hectares)\nChange in\nArea (000\nhectares)\nfrom 1990 to\n2010\n1990\n2000\n2005\n2010\nIndigenous Closed\nCanopy\nForest (Forest land)\n1,240\n1,190\n1,165\n1,140\n-100\nIndigenous\nMangroves\nMangrove (Forest land)\n80\n80\n80\n80\n0\nOpen Woodlands\nWoodland (Forest land)\n2,150\n2,100\n2,075\n2,050\n-100\nPlantation Forests –\nPublic\nPlant Public (Forest land)\n170\n134\n119\n1,381\n-32\nPlantation Forests –\nPrivate\nPlant Private (Forest\nland)\n68\n78\n83\n94\n26\nBush-land\nBushland (Grassland)\n24,800\n24,635\n24,570\n24,510\n-290\nGrasslands – Other\nLand\nGrassland (Grassland)\n6,438\n6,291\n6,210\n6,210\n-228\nGrasslands – Other\nWooded Land\nGrassland (Grassland)\n3,863\n4,194\n4,140\n4,140\n-137\nSettlements\nSettlement\n(Settlements)\n8,256\n8,192\n8,152\n8,202\n-54\nFarms\nFarms (Cropland)\n9,420\n10,020\n10,320\n10,385\n965\nInland Water Bodies\nOther Land (Other land)\n1,123\n1,123\n1,123\n1,123\n-\nTotal Area for\nCountry\n\n58,037\n58,037\n58,037\n58,037\n-\nSource: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2010).

It is estimated that overall, living\nbiomass carbon stocks declined from 829 MT of\nCarbon in 1990 to 760 MT of Carbon in 2010.\nSoil carbon stocks were estimated to decline\nonly slightly from 3,016 MT of carbon in 1990 to\n3,015 Mt of carbon in 2010.\n\nIndirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nIndirect greenhouse gas emissions of NOX and\nCO are the result of vegetation fires. Table 27\nidentifies these emissions over time.\n\nTable 28: Total LULUCF Indirect GHG Emissions from Vegetation Fires (Gg)\nIndirect GHG Emissions\nSector in IPCC\nGuidelines\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nNOX\n5E\n0.18\n0.18\n0.18\n0.17\nCO\n5E\n256.9\n251.1\n256.3\n250\n\n75\n\nWaste\n\nWastes through the processes of disposal,\ntreatment, recycling and incineration produce\ngreenhouse gas emissions. The most important\ngas produced in this source category is methane\n(CH4). Two major sources of this type of CH4\nproduction are solid waste disposal to land and\nwastewater\ntreatment.\nIn\neach\ncase,\nmethanogenic bacteria break down organic\nmatter in the waste to produce CH4. The\nemission potential increases the better the\ndisposal site control conditions are and the\ngreater the depth of the solid waste.\nWastewater emission potential increases for\nwastewater that is treated in anaerobic\nconditions and has a high degree of organic\ncontent, such as those from the residential and\ncommercial\nsectors,\nfood\nand\nbeverage\nindustries and from the pulp and paper\nindustry.\n\nWaste incineration, like other forms of\ncombustion, generates CO2 as well as smaller\namounts of CH4 and N2O emissions, depending\non the composition of the waste. The\nbreakdown of human sewage can also lead to\nsignificant amounts of indirect N2O emissions.\n\nThe calculation of methane emissions from\nSolid\nWaste\nDisposal Sites\n(SWDS)\nwas\ncompleted using the Tier 1 First Order Decay\n(FOD) Model methodology from the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines. The FOD method produces a timedependent emission profile that better reflects\nthe true pattern of the degradation process\nover time, as opposed to the default method\nthat assumes all potential CH4 is released in the\nyear the waste is disposed. The 2006 Waste\nModel spreadsheet developed by the IPCC was\nemployed to estimate emissions between 1995\nand 2010.

The most important emission sources\nwere both related to agriculture, and primarily,\nto livestock. Enteric Fermentation accounted for\n\n30% of emissions and N2O emissions from\nagricultural soils accounted for 25% of overall\nemissions. The major contributor to N2O\nemissions from agricultural soils is manure\napplied or left on agricultural lands.

These\nuncertainties include the lack of precision of\nactivity data to incomplete knowledge of the\nprocesses that cause emissions or removals of\ngreenhouse gases. The 2000 Good Practice\nGuidance recognizes that the uncertainty of\nestimates cannot be completely eliminated and\nthat the main objective should be to produce\naccurate estimates, i.e., estimates that are\nneither underestimated nor overestimated,\n\n81\n\nwhile at the same time, whenever possible\nseeking to improve estimate precision.\nIn accordance with the recommendations, an\nattempt was made in the inventory to ensure\nthat estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and\nremovals were not biased. Estimate precision\nvaried depending on each sector’s available\ndata as well as resources that could be\ninvestigated for determining emission factors\nthat suited circumstances in Kenya. Where\nemissions and removals were identified in the\nkey category analysis as the most important\noverall, emphasis was given, where possible, to\nensuring that the best activity data and\nemission factors available were used.\n\nThe overall Inventory uncertainty is the result of\nthe uncertainty associated with all activity and\nemission factor data and other parameters used\nin the estimates. For most sectors, it was not\npossible to conduct a detailed uncertainty\nanalysis,\nsince\nthat\nwould\ndemand\na\nconsiderable effort in analyzing the accuracy\nand precision of basic information used.\nNevertheless, a general evaluation of Inventory\nprecision\nwas\nconducted\nbased\non\nthe\njudgment\nand\nknowledge\nof\ninventory\nspecialists. The objective was to identify sources\nof emissions and removals where additional\nresources could be used in the future to reduce\nthe level of overall uncertainty. The precision\nassociated with activity data and emission\nfactors, as well as emission or removal\nestimates, is expressed as a ± a given\npercentage based on a 95% confidence interval\nlimit.\n\nTable 45 details the results of the analysis of\nuncertainty\nfor\nemission\nand\nremoval\nestimates. More detailed descriptions of\nuncertainties are provided in the sectoral level\ninventory reports.\n\nThe highest uncertainty of emission estimates\nwhen considering both uncertainty with activity\ndata and emissions factors is related to the\nestimates of the carbon stocks of forest (i.e.,\nForest Land Remaining Forest Land) in the\nLULUCF sector. The combined uncertainty as a\npercentage of total national emissions in 2010 is\n17.5%. The next highest source is related to\ndirect and indirect emissions of N2O from\nagricultural soils. The combined uncertainty as a\npercentage of total national emissions in 2010\nfor this source is 8.4%.\n\nTable 36: Tier 1 Uncertainty Calculations and Reporting\nIPCC Source Category\nGas\nYear\nemissions\n2010\nActivity data\nuncertainty\nEmission\nfactor\nuncertainty\nCombined\nUncertainty\nCombined\nuncertainty as\n% of total\nnational\nemissions in\nyear 2010\n\nGg CO2\nequivalent\n%\n%\n%\n%\n1.A Fossil Fuel Combustion\nCO2\n11,755\n10\n5\n11.2\n1.83\nCH4\n4,137\n60\n50\n78.1\n4.49\nN2O\n1,299\n60\n100\n116.6\n2.10\n1.B Fugitive Emissions\nCH4\n1\n10\n50\n51.0\n0.00\n2.A.1 Cement Production\nCO2\n1,849\n2\n35\n35.1\n0.90\n2.A.2 Lime Production\nCO2\n35\n20\n2\n20.1\n0.01\n2.A.4 Soda Ash Production and Use\nCO2\n243\n20\n20\n28.3\n0.10\n2.F Consumption of Halocarbons\nHFC\n82\n100\n0\n100.0\n0.11\n4.A Enteric Fermentation\nCH4\n14,540\n10\n30\n31.6\n6.39\n\n82\n\n4.B Manure Management\nCH4\n541\n10\n20\n22.4\n0.17\nN2O\n225\n10\n50\n51.0\n0.16\n4.C Rice Cultivation\nCH4\n278\n10\n40\n41.2\n0.16\n4.D Agricultural Soils\nN2O\n11,890\n10\n50\n51.0\n8.42\n4.E Prescribed Burning of Agricultural\nResidues\nCH4\n1,667\n40\n20\n44.7\n1.04\nN2O\n304\n40\n20\n44.7\n0.19\n4.F Field Burning of Agricultural Residues\nCH4\n105\n50\n50\n70.7\n0.10\nN2O\n31\n50\n50\n70.7\n0.03\n5.A.1 Forest Land Remaining Forest Land\nCO2\n16,821\n69\n30\n75.0\n17.53\nCH4\n3\n30\n70\n76.2\n0.00\nN2O\n0\n30\n70\n76.2\n0.00\n5.B.1 Cropland Remaining Cropland\nCO2\n615\n40\n70\n80.6\n0.69\n5.B.2 Land Converted to Cropland\nCO2\n3,560\n69\n30\n75.0\n3.71\n5.C.1 Grassland Remaining Grassland\nCO2\n179\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.19\n5.E.1 Settlements Remaining Settlements\nCO2\n-85\n69\n30\n75.0\n-0.09\n6.A Solid Waste Disposal on Land\nCH4\n277\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.29\n6.B.1 Industrial Wastewater\nCH4\n348\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.36\n6.B.2 Domestic and Commercial\nWastewater\nCH4\n601\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.63\nN2O\n664\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.69\n6.C Waste Incineration\nCO2\n7\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.01\nCH4\n0\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.00\nN2O\n0.2\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.00\n\nTOTAL\n71,974\n\nThe results in Table 44 suggest that efforts to\nreduce the overall uncertainty of Kenya’s\ngreenhouse gas inventory could be focused on\nonly a few emission sources.

The primary activity required is\nto improve the overall understanding of\ncarbon stocks in forests. The representation\nof forest lands in the inventory should be\nimproved.

Included in report will be\nthe new categories for land representation. In\naddition, careful monitoring through the\nexamination of regular and consistent geospatial data should be conducted to improve\nestimates of forest land-use changes. It is\nessential that data be collected to link landuse changes from the available GIS data to\nabove ground biomass stocks, biomass\ngrowth and biomass removals. As part of this\neffort detailed surveys should be undertaken\nto\nascertain\nthe\namount\nof\nbiomass\n(fuelwood, wood for charcoal, commercial\nharvesting) that is removed from forests and\ntheir geographic distribution.

N2O\nemissions are driven by the application of\nmanure to soils, or simply by manure from\npasture being left on grazing lands. The use of\nagricultural\nresidues\nas\na\nfertilizer\nenhancement also contributes to significant\nN2O emissions. Improving the estimates of\nlivestock\npopulations\nand\ndetermining\ncountry specific rates of nitrogen excretion\nfrom livestock will greatly improve the overall\nestimates. Country-specific Tier 2 level\nnitrogen excretion rates for different livestock\ncategories describe the annual average\nnitrogen excretion for each livestock species\nin the country in kg N/animal/yr. N excretion\nrates can be derived from N intake and N\nretention data. This typically requires the\ngross\nenergy\nintake\nof\nthe\nanimal\n(MJ/animal/day), the percent crude protein in\nthe diet, milk production for dairy cattle and\nweight gain per day. In addition, improving\nestimates of overall quantities of nitrogen\nfertilizers and agricultural residues applied as\na fertilizer to fields would reduce overall\nuncertainty.\n\nx Enteric Fermentation. Tier 1 emission factors\nare used in the analysis and the adoption of a\nTier 2 methodology emission factors would\nsignificantly improve the quality of the\nestimates. The use of a Tier 2 methodology\nwould require the development of country\nspecific emission factors based on enhanced\nlivestock characteristics. Data required to\ndevelop country specific emission factors\nincludes average daily feed intake or\nalternatively weight, average weight gain per\nday, feeding conditions, milk production, fat\ncontent of milk, percentage of females that\ngive birth, number of offspring and feed\ndigestibility. It is recommended that this is\npursued for dairy and non-dairy cattle\nlivestock as this represents 67% of total\nenteric\nfermentation\nemissions.\nImprovements\nin\nestimates\nof\noverall\nlivestock populations would also reduce\nuncertainty.\n\nx Fossil Fuel Combustion. Uncertainty in fossil\nfuel combustion emissions is driven by the\nuncertainty in the consumption of fuelwood\nand charcoal in Kenya. A new national survey\nto characterize wood removal for energy\nconsumption is imperative to improving the\nquality of the data. Surveys should be\nconducted for both consumers and producers\nof fuelwood and charcoal. A comparison of\ntop-down end-use surveys with estimates of\nbottom-up harvesting and production could\nsignificantly\nreduce\nuncertainty.\nCH4\nemissions from the residential sector which is\nthe fifth most important key category is\ndominated by emissions related to biomass\ncombustion.\n\nx Carbon emissions from land converted to\ncropland. New land-use data information\ngathered for Croplands should be examined\nto determine whether assumptions that\napproximately 5,000 ha per year of natural\nForest Land as well as large areas of\nWoodlands and Bushlands were converted to\ncroplands between 1990 and 2010. This data\nlikely now exists with the Kenya Forest\nService. In addition, it is important to\nimprove estimates of how much carbon is\nreleased in relation to these conversions.\n\nINVENTORY GAPS, NEEDS AND\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nA number of significant gaps, needs and\nconstraints\nwere\nidentified\nduring\nthe\npreparation\nof\nthe\nSecond\nNational\nCommunication (SNC) inventory for Kenya.\nGaps include not only information on activity\ndata, but also resources and capacity. There is a\nstrong need for institutional capacity building\nand training of government staff to do the\nnecessary data collection and analysis required\nto reduce inventory uncertainties and improve\nthe quality of activity data and emission factors\nused to generate the inventory.\n\n84\n\nThe sub-sections below summarize specific\ngaps, needs and recommendations associated\nwith activity data collection, capacity building\nand development of an integrated and\nsustainable Greenhouse Gas Inventory System.\nActivity Data Collection\nKey data gaps that were identified in regards to\nactivity data and are outlined in Table 46 below\nand are organized by IPCC Sector. Specific\nrecommendations are also provided that could\nbe followed to address the data gaps.\n\nTable 37: Key Inventory Activity Data Gaps and Recommendations\nIPCC Sector\nKey Activity Data Gap Identified\nRecommendation for Addressing Data Gap\nEnergy\nNational energy balances, including imports,\nexports, consumption and international\nbunker data for major economic sectors are\nnot available (e.g., residential, commercial,\ntransportation etc).\nNational energy balances should be routinely\nprepared by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum\nand should include biomass fuels.\nEstimates of woodfuel and charcoal\nconsumption have very high uncertainty and\nare not based on recent surveys.\nA comprehensive nation-wide bottom-up survey of\nproducers and a top-down survey of consumers\nshould be conducted (by Kenya Forest Service) to\nreduce the level of uncertainty associated with\nproduction and demand for woodfuel and charcoal.\nIndustrial\nProcesses\nLime production data is based on an\ninternational agency source (US Geological\nSurvey)\nCountry-level data should be collected by the\nindustry sub-sector (at Kenya Association of\nManufactures or KEPSA) and available from the\nKenya National Bureau of Statistics.\nInformation on the amount of HFCs imported\nannually in bulk and in products is not\ncomplete and has a high degree of\nuncertainty. Bulk imports of HFCs are tracked\nby NEMA using customs excise data;\nhowever, the reliability of the data is low as\nthere are problems with the assignment of\nappropriate HS Codes and information that\nclearly identifies the type of HFC or other\nozone depleting substance that is being\nimported.\n\nAdditional training and support should be provided\nto customs agents so that there is a reliable tracking\nsystem for HFCs. The primary route of entry for HFCs\nis through products and surveys should be\nconducted to reliably estimate the number of HFC\ncontaining products imported and the charge and\ntype of HFCs in associated air conditioning,\nrefrigeration and aerosol products.\nSolvent and\nProduct Use\nInformation on solvents and paints imported\nis difficult to obtain and collate so that it can\nbe used in inventory work. While customs\ntracks imports through HS Codes, the\ndatabase is not easily accessible.\nData should be made available in electronic format\nand summarize annual quantities in consistent units\nof different solvents and paints associated with\nspecific HS Codes.\n\nInformation on bulk imports of nitrous oxide\nwere not available for the inventory\nBulk imports of nitrous oxide gas should be tracked\nby customs and provided in electronic format\nindicating annual quantities imported.\n\n85\n\nIPCC Sector\nKey Activity Data Gap Identified\nRecommendation for Addressing Data Gap\nAgriculture\nData on the fraction of different livestock that\nare managed under different animal waste\nmanagement systems is lacking and default\ndata was used.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries\nshould undertake an assessment to accurately\ndetermine the fraction of different livestock that are\nmanaged under different animal waste management\nsystems.\nPrescribed burning of Savannah was\nestimated from IPCC defaults, but it is\nsuspected that burning practices have\nsignificantly changed over the years which\nmay have reduced burning from historic\nlevels.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries\nshould undertake an assessment of the burning of\nsavannah to determine if the estimated areas\nburned represent existing management conditions\nin Kenya.\nPrescribed burning of crop residues was\nestimated for four major crops (maize, rice,\ncorn and sugarcane).\nThe Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries\nshould review the assumptions regarding prescribed\nburning of crop residues and if necessary conduct\nsurveys to estimate the extent of the practice for\ndifferent crops.\nLULUCF\nChanges in land-use were estimated using a\nforest orientated dataset of land-use\nclassification from the Food and Agricultural\nOrganization (FAO). The data was used\nbecause it was the best available at the time\nthe inventory work was conducted.\nThe Kenya Forest Service (KFS) is working to develop\na national land classification system aligned with\nIPCC Guidance and could become the future basis of\nestimating removals and emissions from the LULUCF\nsector. KFS is working on the National Forest\nInventory, which will be able to inform the next GHG\nInventory work. Continued research and effort is\nrequired to link the land-use changes indicated in\nthis report to biomass stocks and changes in carbon\npools.\nEstimates of wood removal from forests for\nwoodfuel and charcoal are unreliable and not\nbased on recent surveys.\nWork on estimates of woodfuel removal and\ncharcoal production identified for the energy sector\nwould greatly enhance the robustness of the\nremoval and emission estimates of the LULUCF\nsector. This work could be run by the Kenya Forest\nService\nWaste\nEstimates of domestic and industrial solid\nwaste sent to solid waste management sites\nhave a high degree of uncertainty. The\ninventory work draws on the environmental\nassessments for four solid waste disposal\nsites within Kenya.\nThe National Environment management Authority\nshould collect and provide data on the amount of\nwaste deposited annually. This data should be\nestimated either through weigh scale records or\nrecords of the number of vehicle loads.\n\n86\n\nIPCC Sector\nKey Activity Data Gap Identified\nRecommendation for Addressing Data Gap\nThe total degradable organic content of\nindustrial wastewater was estimated based\non the production (tonnes) of different\nproducts that typically generate high volumes\nof industrial wastewater. High level\nassumptions were made regarding the type of\ntreatment facilities in place. The National\nEnvironment management Authority has\nadditional data on more than a 1,000\nwastewater treatment facilities that could be\nreviewed.\nNEMA could undertake a review of existing data on\nindustrial wastewater treatment sites to generate\nmore reliable estimates of the total degradable\norganic content of industrial wastewater produced\nand the associated type of treatment.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nCapacity building is required at both the\ninstitutional and personnel level and multisectoral representation (i.e., Energy, Industrial\nProcesses,\nSolvent\nand\nProduct\nUse,\nAgriculture, LULUCF and Waste) is critical.\nAlthough some initial and basic training on\ngreenhouse gas inventory work has been\nprovided under the Ministry of Environment\nWater and natural Resources through the UNDP\nsponsored Low Emission Capacity Building\nProgramme, it is recommended that training\nworkshops be conducted as part of future\ngreenhouse gas inventory work to provide both\nto government staff and local consultants\nsectoral level training. The workshops should\nfocus on familiarizing a wide audience of\nstakeholders with inventory methodologies and\ntools, engaging them in the data collection\nprocess and providing them with hands-on\nexperience with inventory data, methods and\ntools. The ultimate objective should be such\nthat appointed government staff can complete\nall aspects of inventory work with limited\noutside consultancy.\n\nDifferent national and county government\ndepartments and organizations integral to\ninformation gathering for the different sectors\n(e.g., Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and\nFisheries, Kenya Forest Service, Ministry of\nEnergy and Petroleum and the Kenya Revenue\nAuthority) need to develop capacity to continue\nsupporting GHG inventories. One suggested\napproach is to provide training for sector leads\nfrom each of the six major sink/source\ncategories (Energy, Industrial Processes, Solvent\nand Product Use, Agriculture, Land-Use Change\n& Forestry, and Waste). It is recommended that\nat the beginning of the development of future\ninventories\nthat\nresponsibilities,\nroles,\nresources and training for sectoral teams be\nclearly identified. Sustainable Development and\nEnvironment\nStaff,\nwho\nare\nultimately\nresponsible\nfor\nthe\npreparation\nof\nthe\ninventory, should be exposed to all sector\ntraining so as to serve as local assistance to\nnational experts.\n\nThe capacity building should be designed to\nestablish ongoing data collection and analysis in\nall the relevant government ministries and\ndepartments, should include the necessary\nprivate sector participation at both association\nand industry sector levels.\n\nSustainable Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nSystems\n\nDeveloping a sustainable GHG Inventory system\nshould be a key objective for Kenya to address\nthe challenge of more frequent and demanding\n\n87\n\nreporting of inventories to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC).\nFrequent,\naccurate,\nconsistent,\ncomplete and transparent reporting for Kenya is\ncrucial for not only meeting international\nobligations but for the assessment of Nationally\nAppropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and\nfor projecting global progress towards targets\nto stop dangerous climate change warming.\n\nIn the context of more frequent reporting of\nnational GHG inventories by non-Annex I\nParties, it is imperative that the preparation\nprocess shift from a project-based approach to\na more internalized and institutionalized\napproach (UNFCCC, 2012). This shift would\nsupport the timely delivery of the required\ninformation and more efficient use of available\nresources by Parties. Experience in Kenya has\ndemonstrated that because the development of\ngreenhouse gas inventories has been conducted\non an ad-hoc basis with the use of consultants\nthere has been a “memory loss” between the\npreparation of the INC and the SNC and\ninsufficient capacity developed within internal\nstructures. Clear records of activity data used in\nthe INC and methodologies followed were not\nalways retained which makes it difficult to\nvalidate previous assumptions and update the\ninventory.\n\nInsufficient evidence and documentation of\nquality control/quality assurance also brought\ninto question the reliability of the existing 1994\nInventory. In addition lessons learned from the\npreparation of the INC were not passed on in an\neffective manner since methodological choices\nwere not always explained.\n\nKey components of a sustainable GHG have\nbeen identified by IPCC and UNFCCC guidelines\nand are indicated below:\n\nx\nInstitutional Arrangements;\nx\nMethods and Data Documentation;\nx\nQA/QC Procedures;\nx\nArchiving;\nx\nKey Category Analysis; and,\nx\nInventory improvement planning.\n\nA brief description of each of these components\nfollows; however, any system must be tailored\nto account for national circumstances and\nconstraints.\nFurther\ndetails\nof\nthese\ncomponents are available from the United\nStates Environmental Protection Agency’s (US\nEPA’s) approach to building sustainable national\nGHG inventory management systems using predefined National System Templates.\n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\nInstitutional\nArrangements\nidentify\nhow\ndifferent organizations can work together for\ncollective action. These arrangements can\neither be formal or informal, and should include\nprovisions that define roles and responsibilities\nof all the organizations that are involved in the\ninventory preparation process including key\nstakeholders.\n\nClearly defining institutional arrangements can\nhelp inventory teams assess and document the\nstrengths\nand\nweaknesses\nof\nexisting\ninstitutional\narrangements\nfor\ninventory\ndevelopment so as to ensure continuity and\nintegrity\nof\nthe\ninventory,\npromote\ninstitutionalization of the inventory process,\nand\nfacilitate\nprioritization\nof\nfuture\nimprovements. Memoranda of Understanding\ncan be executed between the lead institution\nand lead sector institutions that clearly outlines\nthe expected deliverables and responsibilities\nand ensures that they have a mandate for\nongoing contributions to the preparations of\nthe\ninventories.\nThrough\nclearly\ndefined\ninstitutional arrangements, it will be easy to\nassess the existing capacity gaps and how to\naddress them.\n\nA sustainable GHG inventory system is best\nserved by a strong lead institution that has a\nsound and capable expert team to develop\ninventories without extensive support from\n\n88\n\nexternal consultants.\n\nMethods and Data Documentation\n\nDocumenting the choice of methodologies and\nthe activity data and emission factors used to\nprepare estimates of greenhouse gas emissions\nand removals is critical to the transparency of\nthe inventory. Identifying documentation\nprocedures can assist inventory teams in\nreporting the origin of methodologies, activity\ndatasets, and emission factors used to estimate\nemissions or removals. Future inventory teams\ncan then refer to the documentation to\ndetermine what information was collected, how\nthe data were obtained, and what methods\nwere used, as well as to reproduce estimates.\n\nIn addition to this inventory report, individual\nsector level inventory reports have been\nprepared to clearly document all methods and\ndata for easy future reference.\n\nQA/QC Procedures\n\nQuality assurance (QA) is a planned system of\nreview procedures. It is performed by\npersonnel not directly involved in the inventory\ncompilation and development process. Quality\ncontrol (QC) is a system of routine technical\nactivities to assess and maintain the quality of\nthe inventory as it is being compiled. It is\nperformed by the personnel compiling the\ninventory. Identifying QA/QC procedures can\nhelp to establish a cost-effective QA/QC\nprogram\nthat\nimproves\ntransparency,\nconsistency, comparability, completeness, and\nconfidence in national GHG inventories.\n\nArchiving\n\nArchives refer to a collection of records in a\ngiven location that have been created during\nthe development of the inventory (references,\nmethodological\nchoice,\nexpert\ncomments,\nrevisions, etc.). An archive system helps to\nmake a national inventory transparent, allows\nestimates\nto\nbe\neasily\nreproduced\nand\nfacilitates\ndevelopment\nof\nsubsequent\ninventories by future inventory team members.\n\nA position of Archiving Officer within the lead\ninstitution should be considered to undertake\nthis task.\n\nKey Category Analysis\n\nKey category analysis (KCA) has been conducted\nfor this inventory and is presented in the\nprevious section. The KCA identifies the sources\nand/or sinks that have the greatest contribution\nto national emissions, and thus should be the\nfocus of improvement efforts. Resources should\nbe allocated to prioritize the necessary data\ncollection and development of country specific\nemission factors.\n\nInventory Improvement Plan\n\nThe concept of continual improvement is useful\nin developing inventories with the objective of\nincreasing\nthe\ntransparency,\nconsistency,\ncomparability, completeness and accuracy of\ninventories over time. Inventory improvement\nplanning is the process of developing specific\npriorities for future capacity-building projects\nbased on the needs identified for each of the\nkey components of sustainable GHG inventories\n(i.e., institutional arrangements, methods and\ndata\ndocumentation,\nQA/QC\nprocedures,\narchiving and Key Category Analysis. One of the\nkey inputs into the inventory improvement\nprocess should be feedback obtained through\nreviews of previous GHG Inventory reports.\n\nOTHER PLANS AND INTERVENTIONS\nPartnership of the GoK with Australia Aid and\nClinton Climate Initiative.\n\nThe\nSystem\nfor\nLand-based\nEmissions\n\n89\n\nEstimation in Kenya (SLEEK) is a Government of\nKenya\nprogram\nto\ndevelop\na\nrobust\nMeasurement, Reporting and Verification\n\nsystem to estimate land-based emissions in\nKenya\nand\nprovide\nthis\ndata\nto\ndrive\ndevelopment in the country.\n\nThe\nSystem\nfor\nLand-Based\nEmissions\nEstimation in Kenya (SLEEK) is a cutting-edge\nsystem that will track emissions in Kenya and\nfind innovative ways to deliver this information\nto Kenyans.\n\nSLEEK’s primary aim is to allow Kenya to\naccurately estimate and track its carbon\nemissions in the land sector. This includes\nforestry, agriculture, and other land uses. To do\nthis, it will bring together a wide range of data\nsources and scientific information – climate\ndata, models of Kenya’s plants and crops,\ninformation about the carbon content of our\nsoils and maps of land use.\n\nThe system will also play a key role in providing\ninformation to help Kenya respond to a range of\nother development challenges. This includes\nguiding Kenya’s reforestation effort, helping\nreduce emissions from agriculture, and helping\nKenya benefit from carbon markets.\n\nSLEEK will also help put better information in\nthe hands of farmers and communities. SLEEK\nwill provide data that can be used to develop\napps that can help farmers in a wide range of\nways, such as informing decisions about which\ncrop to plant, how many cattle their land can\nsupport, and where trees are most likely to\nsurvive.\n\nTo realise this ambitious agenda, SLEEK is\nbringing together scientists and policy makers\nfrom across the government, strengthening\ntheir capacity to share knowledge and work\nacross academic boundaries. The program is\nbeing delivered by the Ministry of Environment,\nWater and Natural Resources and is supported\nby the Government of Australia through the\nClinton Foundation.\n\nWhat’s MRV?\n Measurement,\nReporting\nand\nVerification\nsystems are used by countries to track their\ncarbon emissions and report changes to the\nUnited National Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC). They play an essential role in helping\ntackle climate change by providing essential\ninformation\nabout\na\ncountry’s\ncarbon\nemissions.\n\nSLEEK is Kenya’s Measurement, Reporting and\nVerification (MRV) system for the land-sector. It\nwill combine weather data, biological growth\nmodels\n(capturing\ncarbon\nemissions\nand\nsequestration from trees, crops and soils), and\nland cover maps to estimate the changes in\nKenya’s land-sector emissions over time. It will\nalso develop scenarios and models to assess\nchanges in carbon emissions in response to land\nuse changes.\n\nWhy does Kenya want a MRV system?\nWithout an accurate assessment of Kenya’s\nemissions it will be difficult to plan effective\npolicies to reduce emissions as well as benefit\nfrom\ninternational\nprograms\nto\nreduce\nemissions through stopping deforestation or\nimplementing clean growth policies. SLEEK will\nposition Kenya as a leader in emissions\nestimation and will provide a basis for other\ncountries in the region and across the world to\nlearn from Kenya.\n\nSLEEK is being delivered by wide range of\ninstitutions\nand\nMinistries\nacross\nthe\nGovernment of Kenya.\n\nThese institutions are working collaboratively\nthrough element working groups, which are\nteams that have been specially convened to\naddress each of the areas needed to build a\nMeasurement,\nReporting\nand\nVerification\n(MRV)\nsystem.\nThese\nteams\nare\nbeing\n\n90\n\ncoordinated by the Ministry of Environment,\nWater and Natural Resources and Natural\nResources.\nx Climate Parameters and Trends: This team is\ncompiling\ncomprehensive\nclimate\ndata\ncovering Kenya and scenarios showing how\nthis could change.\n\nThe Climate Parameters and Trends Element\nWorking Group is responsible for building\ncomprehensive climate maps that will allow\nSLEEK to estimate emissions at any location in\nKenya. These maps will show temperature,\nrainfall, solar radiation, frost and evaporation.\nTo complete this task, the team must\nextrapolate from Kenya’s weather stations\nusing\nnew\nsoftware\nthat\nis\nbeing\nimplemented in Kenya for the first time,\nwhich\nwill\nallow\nKenya\nto\ngenerate\ncomprehensive maps.\n\nThe Climate team will also develop scenarios\nand trends based on IPCC projections. This\nwill improve Kenya’s capacity to plan for the\nimpacts of a changing climate.\n\nA key part of the group’s work is to digitize\nover 1.8 million paper climate records that\nare currently stored in paper format. Once\nthese records are digitised, Kenya’s scientists\nwill have access to a far more complete\nclimate record that will allow them to run\nmore accurate analysis and models. This will\nhelp Kenya’s farmers, communities and land\nmanagers by providing them with more\naccurate weather data to help them make\nessential decisions\n\nx Crop Growth & Plant Parameters: This team\nis building models that will track carbon as\ncrops and plants grow.\n\nThe Crop Growth and Plant Parameters\nElement Working Group is responsible for\nassessing the amount of carbon that is stored\nand emitted in Kenya’s crops and plants as\nthey grow. To do this, the team will undertake\ndetailed assessment of the main crops in\nKenya and will develop models that can track\ncarbon emissions from crops during the\ngrowth process.\n\nMeasuring the emissions from a particular\ncrop is not easy – all leaves, stems and\nbranches need to be measured, and carbon\nneeds to be followed into the soils, deadwood\nand the atmosphere. This work requires the\nscientists involved in SLEEK to set-up a range\nof experimental sites, where they can track\nthe growth of Kenya’s most important plants\nin fine, scientific detail.\n\nThe team is also responsible for identifying\nthe management practices that are used in\nKenya. This is because the level of carbon\nstored by a particular crop can differ\nsignificantly based on the management of\nthat crop. For example, double cropping\nmaize with a second crop will produce a\nsignificantly different response compared\nwith planting maize alone.\n\nx Soil Carbon: This team is assessing the level of\ncarbon stored in Kenya’s soils and using\nmodels to track this change over time.\n\nThe Soil Carbon Element Working Group is\nresponsible for assessing the level of carbon\nstored in Kenya’s soils. Carbon is naturally\nstored in soils and is essential for any type of\ntree growth. As trees grow they draw on\nstores of carbon. Equally, when trees and\nplants die or drop leaves some of this carbon\nis reintroduced into the soil, while the rest\nemitted into the atmosphere.\n\nTo assess the carbon in Kenya’s soils, the Soil\nCarbon team will customize the RothC model\nfor Kenya. RothC is an international model\nthat is used around the world to track the\nflow of carbon dioxide and other gases within\nsoils.\n\nTo undertake this customization the Soil team\n\n91\n\nwill need to set up field trials across Kenya to\nunderstand the different soil types across the\ncountry. To do this, they will need to setup\nintensive field sites that can track changes in\ncarbon over time. They will also need to\nunderstand how soil carbon changes with\ndifferent land-uses.\n\nOnce the team has developed a robust\nunderstanding of different soil types and how\nthey change over time, the team will need to\ndevelop maps that show the distribution of\ndifferent soil types across Kenya\n\nx Forest Biomass and Growth: This team is\ndeveloping models to track how carbon is\nstored and released by trees as they grow.\n\nForests are one of the most important carbon\nsinks in Kenya. The Forest team will be\nresponsible for tracking the changes in\nKenya’s\nforest\ncover\nover\ntime,\nand\nunderstanding how the changes in Kenya’s\nforests effect emissions.\n\nThis is done by measuring the amount of\ncarbon stored in trees as they grow. To do\nthis, scientists must measure the entire tree\nas it grows to understand how much carbon is\nstored in the parts of tree such as the\nbranches, trunk and leaves. This scientific\nprocess must be undertaken for each of the\nkey Kenyan species and models must be\ndeveloped to be able to simulate the process.\n\nThe team also must assess the carbon in the\ndead wood and litter that is shed by the main\nKenyan species.\n\nHaving understood the amount of carbon\ntypically stored in Kenyan species, the team\nwill be responsible for understanding the\ndifferent ways that Kenyan forests are\nmanaged. This will allow the team to use the\nforest models to estimate carbon flows across\nKenya’s forests.\n\nx Land Use Change and Management: This\nteam is responsible for understanding the\ndrivers of change in Kenya’s land sector,\nwhich will help explain change in the future.\n\nThis team will examine the key drivers of\nchange in Kenya’s land-sector. They will look\nat the factors that typically lead to changes\nfrom one use to another. For example, this\nteam will look at the factors which lead to\nconversion of forests to agriculture, such as\nbuilding new roads or the expansions of new\nforests communities.\n\nThis understanding will allow the team to\nunderstand how policy decisions will affect\nKenya’s land-sector. This will provide policymakers and communities with a far more\ndetailed assessment of the implications of\nland-policy decisions.\n\nx Modelling: The modelling team is working to\ncombine the information and data collected\nthrough SLEEK to produce a unified, accurate\nreport of Kenya’s emissions form the landsector.\n\nThe Modelling team is responsible for\ncombining all the data collected through\nSLEEK and using it to estimate Kenya’s\nemissions.\n\nTo do this, the team is working with experts\nto develop and apply cutting-edge tools that\nwill be able to track changes in Kenya’s\nemissions from year to year by combining the\ndata-sets in a way that simulates natural\nprocesses using Kenyan specific data.\n\nx Land Cover Change: This team is responsible\nfor using remote sensing imagery to develop\nmaps that will show the changes in land-cover\nover time.\n\nThe Land Cover Change Element Working\n\n92\n\nGroups is responsible for using remote\nsensing and other satellite imagery to map\nKenya’s lands. These maps will provide as\nmuch information as possible on the land\ncover. For example, the maps will show\nwhether the land is covered by forest,\nbuildings or a particular crop.\n\nUsing historical satellite imagery, this team\nwill then be able to compare maps over time,\nshowing how the land cover has changed in\nKenya. This information will be provided to\nthe modelling team, who will be able to use\nthe maps to estimate how Kenya’s carbon\nemissions have changes as a result of changes\nin land cover.\n\nx Crop Selection App: SLEEK will provide\nweather data & crop data to help farmers\nmake better decisions about how to use their\nland.\n\nx Forest App: This app can use SLEEK weather,\nland-use and forest data to help identify sites\nwhere reforestation is most likely to be\nsuccessful.\nSTATE OF THE ART GIS LAB SET UP AT DRSRS\n\nThe Department of Resource Survey and\nRemote Sensing (DRSRS) has been part of the\nSLEEK program leading the component of data\nprovisioning in the area of Land cover and land\ncover change across the country. Clinton\nFoundation has invested in a state of the art GIS\nlab in the institution to build the country’s\ncapacity to map and track land cover change\nand provide the data during the program and\nfor the long term. The lab has been equipped\nwith 14 desktops and 5 laptops, a server and\nthe latest versions of Geographic Information\nSystem (GIS) and Remote Sensing software that\nwill be used to produce credible land cover\nmaps for monitoring land use changes over\ntime to improve decision making in land use\nmanagement.\n\nRepresentatives from Survey of Kenya, Kenya\nForest Service, DRSRS and Regional Centre for\nMapping of Resources for Development have\nalready started working in the lab and started\nthe land cover mapping work for the country.\nThe lab will continue to produce these maps for\nsustainable flow of data into the SLEEK data\nplatform beyond the program timelines. Over\nthe past 3 weeks, the team has been carrying\nout data preparation and testing of various land\ncover mapping methods to identify the most\nsuitable method that is applicable for Kenya.\n This will set a benchmark of standards for\nsustainability.\n\nProgram Structure\n\n93\n\nSource: MoEWNR; http://www.sleek.environment.go.ke/program-structure/\n\nThe Program Steering Committee develops\npolicy, coordinates inter-ministerial support,\nand approves all workplans and budgets.

This\nimprovement has facilitated a much deeper\nanalysis and understanding of the impacts due\nto climate change on the various sectors.\n\nRecognising that the risks posed by climate\nchange are legitimate but highly unpredictable,\nthe Government of Kenya published in 2010 its\nNCCRS, which investigated climate vulnerability.\nThe NCCAP)116 process included a climate riskbased adaptation analysis through an extensive\nconsultative process which was built on the\nfindings of the NCCRS, with the aim to:\nx Provide evidence of the key climate risks to\nKenya\nx Assess climate change impacts on the sectors\nx Document climate adaptation activities that\nare underway, planned and recommended\nx Develop a set of potential and priority\nadaptation actions to address projected\nclimate impacts per sector that will feed into\nKenya’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP)\nx Support the integration of climate change\nadaptation into relevant new and existing\nsector policies, development, budgetary and\nplanning processes and strategies, and across\ndifferent levels.\n\nThe adaptation analysis conducted during the\nNCCAP is summarised in the Adaptation\nTechnical Analysis Report (ATAR) and detailed\nin a series of reports compiled in the Adaptation\nAnnex to the NCCAP.\n\nA comprehensive National Adaptation Plan\n(NAP) to accompany the NCCAP is at an\nadvanced stage of development. Evidence and\nrecommendations of the ATAR have been\ndrawn on to set adaptation priorities and to\nframe an adaptation strategy that responds to\nKenya’s\ndevelopment\nneeds\nand\nclimate\nvulnerability by proposing initiatives to build\nadaptive capacity and resilience through social\nsectors. A framework is being developed for the\ngovernance of climate adaptation decisionmaking and implementation from local to\nnational levels. The draft NAP addresses the\nintegration of climate change adaptation into\nrelevant new and existing policies, programmes\nand activities; and incorporating adaptation\nplanning in the annual and medium-term\n\n100\n\nplanning processes and strategies, within all\nrelevant sectors and at different levels of\ngovernment.\n\nThis chapter on Assessment of Vulnerabilities\nand Adaptation to Climate Change in Kenya\nassesses past climate trends and briefly\nsummarises\nthe\npossible\nfuture\nclimate\nscenarios in the country, the risks and\nvulnerabilities associated with the trends.\nAdaptation actions are then proposed. The\nchapter draws on existing assessments and\nresearch through desk research, supplemented\nwith expert interviews. The chapter draws\nextensively from prior work including the\nNCCRS, NCCAP, ATAR and Draft NAP, and\nincludes updated research.\n\nBASELINE CLIMATIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND\nSOCI-ECONOMIC SCENARIO\n\nKenya’s baseline climatic, environmental and\nsocio-economic scenarios have been described\nin detail in Chapter 1 of this Second National\nCommunications report.\n\nThe country is situated between 5oN 5oS and\nlongitudes 34oE and 42oE with varied landforms\ntypes\nwhich\nare\ndivided\ninto\nplains,\nescarpments, hills with low and high mountains\nand breaks. What would otherwise be a largely\ntropical climate is moderated by a diverse\ntopography and the influence of the Indian\nOcean and Lake Victoria. This means that Kenya\nexperiences significant geographical climate\nvariations. The Indian Ocean runs along the\ncountry’s south-eastern border, bringing a\ncomparatively wet climate to the narrow\ncoastal zone. This gives way to large areas of\nlow lying semi-arid land that stretch north and\nwest, before rising sharply to the temperate\nhighland plateau, one of Africa’s most fertile\nregions. The plateau is bisected by the East\nAfrica Rift Valley, which separates Lake Victoria\nin the west and the mountainous regions of the\ncentral and northern highlands that include the\nnation’s highest peak of Mount Kenya (at 5,200\nm).\n\nDroughts\nand\nfloods,\noften\nregionally\nconcentrated, occur relatively frequently (on\naverage every three to four years), and are\nlinked to El Niño or La Niña episodes.117 An\nimportant pattern of ocean-influenced climate\nvariability comes from the Indian Ocean Dipole\n(IOD), which can accentuate the effects of El\nNiño episodes and lead to extreme weather in\nthe region. More generally, climate variability of\nboth rainfall and temperature significantly\nimpacts Kenya’s economy. For example, it has\nbeen estimated that flooding costs the country\nin the region of 5.5 per cent of GDP every seven\nyears and drought costs approximately 8 per\ncent of GDP every five years. In total these\nclimatic events cost the country around 2.4 per\ncent of GDP per year.118\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS\n\nPresent Climate Change (Trends and\nbaseline)\n\nObserved Temperature Trends\nTemperatures in Kenya vary dramatically from\nregion to region, with high altitude regions\nexperiencing substantially cooler temperatures\nthan the coastal and lowland zones. Nairobi sits\nin the central highlands at an elevation of\n1,800m and has a mean annual temperature of\n18°C, whereas Mombasa, in the coastal\nlowlands,\nexperiences\nmean\nannual\ntemperatures of 26°C.119 Kenya’s equatorial\nlocation means that there is little temporal\nvariation in temperature, with the coolest\nmonths (June to August) typically being 2°C\ncooler than the warmest.\n\nObserved climate data for Kenya shows a\ndistinct warming trend since the 1960s.120 From\nthe early 1960s, Kenya has experienced\ngenerally increasing temperature trends over\nvast areas. Over the inland areas, the trends in\nboth minimum (night/early morning) and\n\n101\n\nmaximum (daytime) temperatures depict a\ngeneral warming (increasing) trend with time.\nHowever, the increase in the minimum\ntemperatures is steeper than in maximum\ntemperatures. The result of the steeper\nincrease in Tmin and a less steep increase Tmax\nis a reduction in the diurnal temperature range\n(difference\nbetween\nthe\nmaximum\nand\nminimum temperatures) – Figures 33-38 depict\nthese trends for some selected representative\nlocations in the country.\n\nFigure 33: Temperature Trends for Nairobi (Central Kenya).

Annual minimum Temperature.\n\n104\n\nThe minimum temperature depicts a steady increase over the years\nSource: Data and figure from KMD, 2012)\n\nTemperature trends in Kenya since 1960 have\nthe following characteristics:121\n\nx Mean annual temperature has increased by\napproximately 1°C at an average rate of\n0.21°C per decade.\nx The increase in temperature has been most\nrapid in the months from March to May\n(0.29°C per decade) and slowest in June to\nSeptember (0.19°C per decade).\nx The average number of hot days per year\n(defined as daily temperature that is in the\ntop 10% of daytime temperatures for that\nregion and season) has increased by 57 (a\n15.6% increase) between 1960 and 2003. The\nrate of increase is highest in March to May\nwith the average number of hot days\nincreasing by 5.8 days per month.\nx The average number of hot nights per year\n(defined as night-time temperature that is in\nthe top 10% of night-time temperatures for\nthat region and season) increased by 113 (a\n31% increase) between 1960 and 2003. The\nrate of increase is highest from September to\nNovember with the average number of hot\nnights increasing by 12 days per month.\nx The average number of cold days and nights\n(defined as temperatures in the lowest 10%\nfor that region and season) has decreased by\n4.4% and 11.4% respectively. The rate of\ndecrease of cold days is highest in September\nto November (5.7%) and the rate of decrease\nof cold nights is highest from December to\nFebruary (11.5%).\n\nObserved Precipitation Trends\n\nOn an annual basis, rainfall in Kenya is governed\nprimarily by the movement of the Inter-Tropical\nConvergence Zone (ITCZ), a belt of low pressure\nthat forms near the equator and migrates south\nthrough Kenya in October to December and\nreturns, moving northwards in March, April and\nMay. The ITCZ brings wet weather to the region\nand so Kenya experiences two distinct wet\nperiods:\n\nx The ‘long rains’ (March to May)\nx The ‘short rains’ (October to December).122\n\nThe ‘long rains’ bring more than 70% of Kenya’s\n\n105\n\ntotal rainfall with the ‘short rains’ contributing a\nfurther 20%.123 The remaining 6 months of the\nyear are typically dry, contributing just 10% of\nthe country’s total rainfall. There is also\nsignificant geographical variation, with the Arid\nand Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) typically receiving\nless than 250mm compared with up to 2,000\nmm in the high mountain regions (Figures 39 A\nand B).\n\nAs is evident from Figure 39 A, Kenya’s rainfall\nalso varies over longer time periods.124 Annual\nvariation in rainfall is influenced by the\nrelationship between the ITCZ and the surface\ntemperatures of the Indian Ocean. Warmer\nthan average ocean surface temperatures – El\nNiño episodes – usually result in above average\nrainfall in the short rainfall season, whereas\ncolder than average surface temperatures – La\nNiña episodes – bring drier than average\nweather.125 As the ‘short rains’ are most\naffected by the presence of El Niño or La Niña\nconditions, they account for the majority of the\ninter-annual rainfall variability (74%).126\n\nAlthough there is little evidence of an overall\nchange in precipitation, there is a significant\ngeographical diversity in observed rainfall\ntrends. Observed climate trends show mixed\ntrends with some areas having increasing and\nothers decreasing rainfall all over the country\non an annual basis. Whilst considerable\nuncertainty\nremains\nover\nthe\nstatistical\nsignificance of rainfall trends in Kenya, some\nstudies have suggested that the rainfall during\nthe ‘short rains’ can be isolated from the total\nrainfall.127 This would explain the trend for\nnorthern wetting and southern drying.\n\nEven though some studies suggest a generally\nmixed rainfall trends in the country, rainfall\npatterns are highly localised. Rainfall variations\nover Mombasa on Kenya’s coast and Lodwar in\nthe North West of the country demonstrate the\nlocalised nature of rainfall trends over the last\n50 years. (Figures 40 [A, B, and C] and Figure 41\n[A, B and C])\n\n106\n\nFigure 39: Distribution of mean annual rainfall and rainfall variation in Kenya. A: Distribution of mean annual\nrainfall.

They show a\ngenerally increasing trend in the proportion\nof heavy rainfall events (defined as daily\nrainfall total that is in the top 5% of rainfall\nevents for that region and season).\nx\nTrends for 1-day rainfall maxima and 5-day\nrainfall maxima also show inconsistent\ntrends.\nx\nRainfall patterns in the country are highly\nlocalised.\nx\nPeriodic droughts occur in Kenya relatively\nfrequently. Moderate drought events have\nbeen recorded on average every 3-4 years\nand major droughts affect the country\nevery 10 on average. Prolonged droughts\nhave become more common since 2000,\nincreasing the amount of arid and semi-arid\nland area to 80% of the total surface area.11\n\n________________________\n\nFuture Climate Change (Climate Change\nScenarios)\n\nFor Kenya, Regional Climate Models (RCMs)\nthat give greater spatial resolution for Kenya\nhave also been developed.129 130\n\nFuture Temperature Trends\n\nGeneral Circulation Models (GCM)131 data\nindicates that the following trends are\nconsidered likely for temperatures in Kenya.\n132\nStatistics quoted are for medium emissions\nscenario, relative to the baseline period 19611990, unless otherwise stated (see NCCAP and\nATAR for more details):\n\nx Mean annual temperature is projected to\nincrease by between 0.8 and 1.5°C by the\n2030s and 1.6°C to 2.7°C by the 2060s.\nx An increase is projected in the frequency of\n\nx hot days and hot nights. Projections indicate\nthat hot days could occur on 19-45% of days\nby the 2060s and 26-69% of days by the\n2090s. Hot nights are projected to increase\nmore quickly, occurring on 45-75% of nights\nby mid-century and 64-93% of nights by the\nend of the century.\nx Projections suggest a decrease in the number\nof days and nights that are considered ‘cold’\nin the current climate. Cold days and nights\nare expected to become very rare. GCM\nprojections suggest that there will be no cold\ndays or nights by the 2090s.\n\nFigure 42 provides a visualization of the trend\nthat GCMs have suggested for increased\ntemperatures for Kenya.133 Here the size of\nthe pixels indicates the degree of agreement\nover the magnitude of the increase. There is\ngood model agreement of temperature\nincreases of up to 3°C by 2100.\n\n111\n\nFigure 42: Temperature change for Africa by 2100 (from the 1960-1990 baseline) averaged over 21 CMIP3\nmodels\n\nSource: Met Office. (2011). Climate: Observations, projections and impacts. Kenya. Exeter, UK:\nMet Office.\n\nUsing the RCMs, the following temperature\ntrends in Kenya have been projected (See\nFigure 43):134\n\nx The whole of the country could warm by\nbetween 1°C and 5°C (by 2071-2100).\nx The dry seasons (March to May and October\nto December) will experience the greatest\nincrease in temperature, particularly in the\nnorth of the country.\nx The ‘long rains’ from March to May will\n\nexhibit the smallest increase, particularly in\nthe northeast of the country, where negligible\nchanges are projected in comparison to the\nbaseline period.\nx The northwest of the country will be warmer\nby around 1°C more than the rest of the\ncountry.\nx North eastern regions, in particular around\nWajir, will experience relatively less warming\nthan the rest of the country, by approximately\n1 -2°C.\n\n112\n\nFigure 43: RCM (RegCM3) temperature projection results for 2071-2100 (A2 emission scenario; 20km resolution).\n\nSource: GoK; National Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (ATAR)\n\n113\n\nFuture Precipitation Trends\n\nGCM data indicates that the following trends\nmay be seen for rainfall in Kenya.135 The\nfollowing statistics are for an A1B (medium)\nemissions scenario unless otherwise stated\n(see the NCCAP and ATAR for more details).\n\nx GCMs suggest that there may be increases in\naverage annual rainfall in Kenya by the\n2060s. However there is considerable model\ndisagreement with a range of projections\nvarying from a 5% decrease to a 17% increase\nby the 2030s and no change to a 26%\nincrease by 2060s.\nx The increase in total rainfall is projected to\nbe largest from October to December (-6 mm\nto +29 mm per month by 2030s and 0 mm to\n30 mm by the 2060s) and proportional\nchanges largest in January and February (-14\n% to +50 % by 2030s and -6 % to +60 % by\nthe 2060s). Again, the broad span of\nprojections indicates high levels of model\ndisagreement.\nx The GCMs suggest with greater confidence\n(on the basis of good model agreement) that\nthe proportion of annual rainfall that occurs\nin heavy events will increase. The range of\nincrease varies from 2 to 11% by the 2060s\nand 2 to 12% by the end of the century.\nx There\nis\nalso\nrelatively\ngood\nmodel\nagreement that 1 and 5-day rainfall annual\nmaxima will increase. The range of predicted\nincrease for 5-day events is between 2 to\n19mm by the 2060s and 2mm to 24mm by\nthe end of the century.\nx Figure 44 provides a visualisation of the trend\nthat GCMs have suggested for increased\nprecipitation for Kenya. Here the size of the\npixels indicates the degree of agreement\nover the magnitude of the increase. It shows\nthat\nthere\nis relatively\nstrong model\nagreement that precipitation will increase\nover Kenya.\n\nFigure 44: Percentage change in precipitation for Africa by 2100 (from 1960-1990 baseline) averaged over 21\nCMIP3 models.

Exeter, UK: Met Office.\n\n114\n\nThrough RCMs, the following precipitation\ntrends are projected in Kenya by the 2090s:\n\nx During\nthe\n‘long\nrains’,\nKenya\ncould\nexperience a significant increase in rainfall\nwith the largest increase occurring over the\nhighland districts and the coastal region\n(Figure 45 top right).\nx During the ‘short rains’ an increase in rainfall\ncould predominantly affect the region to the\nwest of the Rift Valley. The rest of the country\ncould experience slightly decreased rainfall in\nisolated pockets (Figure 45 bottom right). This\nis in contrast to the GCM average results,\nwhich suggest wetter conditions during the\n‘short rains’.136\nx The northeast of the country is projected by\nthe RCM to become significantly drier on an\nannual basis.

The number of rainfall\n\nmonitoring stations in Kenya has decreased\nfrom 2,000 in 1977, 1,497 in 1990 and 700 in\n2012. Today, Kenya has 62 temperature\nstations and 27 synoptic climate stations\nmeasuring a range of climate variables.138\n\nKey knowledge gaps for climate information\ninclude139:\n\nx Understanding\nrainfall\nseasonality\nand\ngeographical variations by increasing the\nnumber of rainfall monitoring stations to\nimprove regional modelling.\nx The role of ocean patterns on the regional\nclimate is not well understood. Improved\nunderstanding of the relationship between\nthe ENSO (El-Niño Southern Oscillation) and\nIOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) and precipitation\nevents would be advantageous.\nx Further\nresearch\non\nthe\ninfluence\nof\ntopography and of Lake Victoria on local\nclimate patterns is needed.\nx Some of the climate data that has been\ncollected\nis\nyet\nto\nbe\ndigitised\nand\ninformation exchange is limited by poor\ncommunications in some parts of the country.\n\nUncertainty about future climatic conditions\nwill persist, unless there is continued\ninvestment\nin\nseasonal\nforecasts\nand\ndownscaled\nclimate\nprojections.140\nThe\ncommon\napproach\nof\nrepresenting\nuncertainty is to examine output from\ndifferent climate models risks. However, this\nmay result in a gross over-estimation of our\ncurrent ability to predict sectoral responses to\nclimate change, for example in agriculture.141\nAlthough more exhaustive characterisation of\nuncertainty may be scientifically tractable,\nthe prospect of reducing uncertainty\ndepends on further progress being made\nin the underpinning climate science.142, 143\n\nA number of specific actions have been\nidentified and these can be found in\nTable 4 9 .\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND\nVULNERABILITY\nThe increasing variability in climate and the\nprojected incremental changes in air and sea\ntemperatures, precipitation and sea level,\ntogether with changes in the frequency and\nseverity of extreme events will have significant\nimplications\nfor\nsocial,\neconomic\nand\nenvironmental systems. The cumulative impacts\nof climate change over the next two to three\ndecades have the potential to reverse much of\nthe progress made towards the attainment of\nVision 2030. The costs of climate change could\nbe equivalent to 2.6 per cent of Kenya’s GDP\neach year by 2030.\nDroughts\nand\nfloods\nin\nparticular\nhave\ndevastating consequences on the environment,\nsociety and the wider economy. The associated\nspillover to the macro-economy has been\nsignificant. The overall impact of the 2008-2011\ndrought in Kenya is estimated at KSh 968.6\nbillion (USD 12.1 billion), and was predicted to\nhave caused a slowing down in the growth of\nthe country’s economy by an average of 2.8 per\ncent per year during that period. Similarly, the\n1998-2000 drought is estimated to have\nresulted in a 16 per cent reduction in the GDP in\neach of the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 financial\nyears.144 Lost industrial production alone due to\ninadequate power supply during this period\namounted to a loss of approximately KSh 110\nbillion (USD 1.4 billion).145\nFloods have also caused equally devastating\nconsequences in recent years, including loss of\nlives and livelihoods, personal property damage\nand\ndamage\nto\ninfrastructure,\nwith\n\n117\n\nramifications for the economy. For example, the\n1997-98 El Niño floods are estimated to have\ncaused damage equivalent to at least 11 per\ncent of GDP, including KSh 62 billion (USD 777\nmillion) in damage to transport infrastructure\nand KSh3.6 billion (USD 45 million) to water\nsupply infrastructure.\nWhile floods are generally associated with\nhigher damages on public infrastructure assets,\nthe burden of droughts falls more heavily on\npeople, communities and the private sector. In\nparticular, the livestock and agriculture sectors\nwere the most affected by the 2008 and 2011\ndrought events, with respective drops in\nproductivity of 72 per cent and 13 per cent.146\nAlong with these direct impacts, climate-related\nevents affect the overall performance of the\neconomy in the long run. Other macroeconomic trends which have been evident\nduring droughts and which appear to be\nexacerbated by climate related effects include:\n\nx Reduced\nforeign\nexchange\nearnings\n(Kenyan\nbusiness\nand\ninternational\ncompetitiveness)\nx Altered balance of payments (e.g. reduced\nexports, increased imports)\nx Current account deficit (e.g. reduced\ngovernment\nrevenues\nor\nincreased\nexpenses)\nx Price inflation (e.g. increased food or\nenergy prices).\n\nAs detailed in the NCCAP (2013-2017), the\nimpacts and risks identified below are based on\ndesk-based review, utilising peer-review and\ngrey literature, together with Kenya’s First\nNational Communication to the UNFCCC,\nstakeholder\nand\ncounty\nconsultations,\nTechnology Needs Assessment reports and\nother relevant national planning documents. By\nincorporating an assessment of their future\nlikelihood and consequence (the two key\nelements of risk), the assessment prioritised\nand ranked impacts with reference to the\nthemes of the Medium Term Plan. The strength\nof this methodology is that it puts climate\neffects at the centre of the analysis and derives\npriorities to address the most important risks –\noften assessed in terms of expected economic\nlosses where there is adequate information.\n\nRecent UNFCCC decisions have recommended\nnational adaptation planning be based on\nassessments of development needs and climate\nvulnerability. This approach recognises that\nadaptation actions need to address socioeconomic development deficits as well as\nclimate effects. The strength of this approach is\nthat\na\nfuller\nintegration\nwith\nnational\ndevelopment planning and implementation is\npossible than through the climate risks-based\napproaches. In the Draft National Adaptation\nPlan (NAP), the climate risk-based approach of\nthe ATAR and development needs and climate\nvulnerability have been combined to draw the\nstrengths from each. For this reason, this report\nhas heavily borrowed from the work already\ndone in the Draft NAP. Underpinning the Draft\nNAP is a Risk Assessment Report (TR1), which\nbuilds on the review of impacts undertaken for\nthe National Climate Change Response Strategy\n(NCCRS)147,\nand\nprovides\na\nmore\ncomprehensive and systematic assessment of\nhow climate change may exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.\n\nThe climate change impacts and risks to Kenya’s\neconomy have been analysed in detail for each\nsector in the Adaptation Technical Analysis\nReports (ATAR). Impacts for particular sectors\nhave been analysed as follows:\n\nWater Resources\n\nFreshwater\nresources\nare\nalready\nhighly\ninfluenced by inter-and intra-annual rainfall\nvariability, including the extremes of flooding\nand drought and climate change may further\nreduce the availability of this resource through\n\n118\n\naltered rainfall patterns, higher evaporation,\nlower lake levels, accelerated loss of glaciers\nand rising sea level. Water availability is already\na significant problem in cities. For example,\nMombasa receives only half of the water\nrequired to meet its needs, which leads to\nrationing and use of private sources.148\nIncreased temperatures and rainfall variability\nare likely to exacerbate the conditions already\nexperienced and may in the future have a\nsignificant impact on water availability.\n\nIn coastal locations, sea level rise is likely to\nrender more acute the current water supply\nand salinisation problem, as freshwater aquifers\nare contaminated with saline water.\n\nAgriculture, livestock and fishing (food\nsecurity)\n\nClimate change has the potential to significantly\naffect\nagriculture-based\nlivelihoods\nby\nchallenging the sustainability of current arable,\npastoral and fishing practices. Agriculture is\nextremely vulnerable to climate change, due to\nthe natural connections and dependencies that\nexist between climatic conditions and plant\ndevelopment. There are a variety of climate\ndrivers that are likely to directly and indirectly\nimpact agricultural productivity, as outlined\nbelow:\n\nx Higher temperatures are likely to directly\nreduce yields of desirable crops in the longterm. For example, parts of south west Kenya\nhave\nbeen\nhighlighted\nas\npotentially\nexperiencing a flip in the number of reliable\ncrop growing days from more than 90 to less\nthan 90 by the 2050s.149 This will clearly have\nimplications\nfor\nrural\nlivelihoods\nand\n“cropping might become too risky to pursue\nas a major livelihood strategy”.\nx Changes in precipitation patterns are likely to\ndirectly increase the likelihood of short-term\ncrop failures and long-term production\ndeclines. Rain-fed agriculture is and will\nremain the dominant source of staple food\nproduction and the livelihood foundation of\nthe majority of the rural poor in Kenya.150 The\nhigh\ninter-annual\nunpredictability\nin\nprecipitation is already having devastating\nconsequences on rural livelihoods in Kenya,\nwith\ndroughts\nand\nfloods\na\nfrequent\noccurrence in both the arid and semi-arid\nlands (ASALs) and the high potential areas.\nx A number of indirect impacts, such as\nincreased rates of runoff and soil erosion, and\nincreased\ncrop\nlosses\nfrom\nwildlife\nmigrations, insects, diseases and weeds, could\nsignificantly magnify production losses.\n\nDue to the fact that the majority of farmers are\nsmall-scale and subsistence, depending on the\n20% of Kenya’s land that is suitable for\nproducing crops for their own needs, the\nultimate end-point consequences resulting from\na decline in agricultural production are\ndetrimental impacts for food security and\nhuman health.\n\nWith respect to the longer-term implications of\na changing climate on agricultural productivity,\nfor Kenya there will be distinct “winners and\nlosers”, as climate change inevitably favours\nsome crops and regions over others. Equally,\nsome regions, namely the mixed rain-fed\ntemperate and tropical highlands, are projected\nto experience an increase in crop yield, whereas\nothers, namely the ASALs, are projected to\nwitness a significant decline in crop yields and\nlivestock numbers, as water resources become\nincreasingly scarce. These patterns are largely\ndriven\nby\nregional\nvariability\nin\nfuture\nprecipitation and geographic exposure to\nextreme events, particularly drought frequency.\nFor instance, for large parts of the ASALs and\nlowlands, where maize cropping is possible,\nmaize yields are projected to decline by 20 per\ncent by the 2050s.151 These losses are in the\nrange of 200-700 kg/ha, although in some grid\nsquares in the analysis, losses are larger than\nthis.152\nHowever, maize yields are projected to increase\n\n119\n\nin some of the highland areas of the East\nAfrican region, including the central and\nwestern highlands of Kenya, and the Great\nLakes Region by the 2050s. These increases in\nyield equate to between 200-700 kg/ha.153 In a\n\nfurther study,154 maize yield in the mixed rainfed temperate / tropical highland were\nprojected to increase by 33.3% by 2030s and\n46.5% by the 2050s. The possible trends for\nmaize are particularly encouraging, considering\nthe nation’s dependence on this crop and the\nhigh source of calories per capita per day this\ncrop contributes (36%).155\n\nFor the livestock sector, implications of climate\nchange on livestock-based rural livelihoods are\npredicted to be largely negative, with farmers\nexpected to incur heavy losses in the future.\nGrazing and mixed rain-fed livestock systems\nare highly vulnerable to climate, due to their\nheavy dependence on natural resources. A\nchanging climate is likely to have a number of\ndirect and indirect impacts on livestock\nproduction, as outlined below:\n\nx Higher temperatures and reduced water\navailability directly cause heat stress in\nlivestock,\nwhich\naffects\nphysiological\nprocesses, health and mortality. For example,\nheat stress for cattle causes a decrease in\nfood intake and an increase in respiratory\nrate, which affects milk yields.156 In a warmer\nclimate, excessively high temperatures are\npredicted to damage livestock production\n(through losses of herds to drought, which\nfrequently occurs currently in ASALs), as\nfarmers are forced to reduce their stock levels\nor risk losing them altogether.157\nx Livestock systems are directly impacted by\nnatural disasters, specifically flooding. For\nexample, during the El Niño flood of 1997/98,\nlarge numbers of livestock died from\ndrowning in the floodwaters, with several\nregions experiencing losses of over 90%.158\nx Climate\nchange\nmay\nindirectly\ncause\nincreased disease pressure on livestock,\nthrough direct effects on pathogens, hosts,\nvectors and epidemiology, together with a\nnumber of indirect effects, including changes\nin ecosystems and the abundance and/or\ndistribution of the competitors, predators and\nparasites of vectors.159\nx Climate-induced changes in crop resources\nwill have knock-on negative and positive\nconsequences for livestock systems, through\nthe allocation of feedstuffs, such as pasture,\nforage and grain. Changes in the quantity and\nquality of feed will encourage farmers to\neither decrease or increase their stocks.160\n\nPastoralism is the dominant form of livestock\nkeeping in Kenya. Approximately 60% of the\ncountry’s livestock is found in the ASALs, which\nconstitute about 80% of the country’s land mass\nand home of approximately 10% of the\ncountry’s population161. Extreme weather and\nclimate events already greatly impact the\nlivelihoods of pastoralists in Kenya, as the ASALs\nare\nlargely\ncharacterised\nby\nhigh\nevapotranspiration rates, low organic matter\nand poor infrastructure.162 Greater drought\nfrequency, in particular, may inhibit crop and\nanimal system recovery, resulting in long-term\ndegradation of grazing resources, continual\nreduction in herd size, and destabilisation of the\nsocial and economic standing of resource-poor\nlivestock keepers.20163\nAn increased drought frequency to more than\none drought every five years could cause\nsignificant, irreversible decreases in livestock\nnumbers in ASALs.164 Results indicate that a\ndrought\nonce\nevery\nfive\nyears\n(i.e.\nrepresentative of current conditions) keeps\nherd sizes stable in ASALs.165 Increased\nprobability of drought to once every three years\nhas the potential to decrease herd sizes, due to\nincreased mortality and poorer reproductive\nperformance of the animals.166 Recent droughtassociated food insecurity has been highest\namong the pastoralists and small-scale mixed\nfarmers found within these regions.167\n\nFor the fisheries sector, climate change-induced\n\n120\n\ndegradation of both freshwater and marine\nenvironments is likely to have significant\nimplications for associated biodiversity and\nfisheries. Increasing water temperatures and\ndecreasing water levels are likely to negatively\nimpact\nfish\nstocks,\nwith\ndetrimental\nconsequences for the rural communities such\nsystems support. With respect to marine fishing\nactivities, direct effects of climate change on\nmarine capture fisheries include sea level rise,\nsea temperature change, lower ocean pH levels,\nand changes in rainfall that will affect estuarine\nfisheries,\nchanges\nin\nocean\ncirculation,\nincreased storm frequency and intensity. These\ndirect effects will in turn alter fish habitats and\nchange the distribution and composition of\nspecies, which will have a profound impact on\nmarine ecosystems and fisheries.\n\nIn recent times, the fisheries sector has\nexperienced the detrimental consequences of\nclimate variability, specifically droughts. The\n2008-2011 drought impacted Kenya’s fisheries\nsector in a variety of complex and interrelated\nways. Low inflows into the lakes and reservoirs\nas a result of prolonged drought condition\ncoupled with the high evaporative effects have\ncontributed to receding water levels (e.g. Lakes\nTurkana, Naivasha, and Baringo) and the drying\nup of ponds.168 The receding water in the Lakes\nreduced the breeding grounds and also the\nfishing grounds, and some of the streams\nfeeding the lakes dried altogether.169\n\nIn summary, these are the impacts of climate\nvariability and climate change on Agriculture,\nLivestock and Fishing sector:\n\nx Higher temperatures are likely to directly\nreduce yields of desirable crops in the long\nterm. For example, parts of south west\nKenya have been highlighted as potentially\nexperiencing a significant reduction in the\nnumber of reliable crop growing days by\nthe 2050s170.\nx Changes in precipitation patterns are likely\nto directly increase short-term crop\nfailures and long-term production declines\nfor rain-fed agriculture. The high interannual unpredictability in precipitation is\nalready having negative consequences on\nrural livelihoods.\nx A number of indirect impacts, such as\nincreased rates of runoff and soil erosion,\nand increased crop losses from wildlife\nmigrations, insects, diseases and weeds,\ncould significantly magnify production\nlosses.\nx Declines in agricultural production will be\ndetrimental for the food security and\nhuman health of small-scale subsistence\nfarmers and their local communities.\nx Approximately\n60\nper\ncent\nof\nthe\ncountry’s livestock is found in the ASALs,\nwhich constitute about 80 per cent of the\ncountry’s land mass and which are home\nof\n30\nper\ncent\nof\nthe\ncountry’s\npopulation171. Pastoralism is the dominant\nform of livestock-keeping in the ASALs and\ngiven the recourse to mobility to manage\nclimate\nvariability,\npastoralism\nis\ninherently\nadaptive.\nHowever,\nthe\nincreased frequency of extreme weather\nevents, multiply the impact of factors that\nconstrain pastoralists’ livelihoods. Climate\nchange introduces additional uncertainties\ninto existing vulnerabilities, particularly in\nthe ASALs.172\n\nDroughts, being the prime recurrent disaster in\nKenya have occurred in 1991/92, 1995/96,\n1998/2000, 2004/2005, and 2008-11. The cycle\nof drought is becoming shorter, more frequent\nand more intense. Each of these events has\ncaused\nsevere\ncrop\nlosses,\nfamine\nand\npopulation displacement in the country. The\nprolonged drought of 2008 - 2011 resulted in\ncrop production losses of Ksh 69 billion for food\ncrops and Ksh 52 billion for cash crops, with\nmaize, tea and coffee losses being the highest.\n\nThe livestock sector experienced the worst\n\n121\n\nimpacts, losing approximately Ksh 699 billion,\nwith Ksh 56 billion in damages due to costs\nfrom veterinary care, water, feeds and\nproduction decline and Ksh 643 billion in losses\ndue to animal deaths.173\n\nDuring the 2008-2011 drought, the fisheries\nsector experienced effects with estimated value\nof Ksh 4.2 billion, comprising Ksh 3.6 billion in\nlosses and Ksh 0.5 billion in damages.\n\nImpacts on coastal zones\n\nClimate change impacts, including increases in\nsea surface temperature, sea level rise and\ncoastal erosion, are likely to put additional\npressure on coastal ecosystems174, including\nislands, estuaries, beaches, coral reefs and\nmarine\nbiodiversity.\nSea\nlevel\nrise\nin\ncombination with extreme weather events is\nlikely to intensify flooding as the majority of the\ncoastland is low-lying. Coral reef ecosystems\nare particularly vulnerable to climate change\nimpacts, with associated consequences for the\nlivelihoods of millions of people depending on\nthose ecosystems for food, income and\nshoreline protection. In the Western Indian\nOcean region, corals are already experiencing\nsubstantial\nstress\nfrom\nincreasing\nwater\ntemperatures and ocean acidity, with several\nsignificant coral bleaching and mortality events\nin recent decades (e.g. 1998). Climate change is\nvery likely to lead to more of such events and\nlower the recovery rate of pre-bleaching coral\ncover,\nfollowing\nincreasing\nsea\nsurface\ntemperatures. Furthermore, marine biological\ninvasions are increasingly recognised as a threat\nto biodiversity. Invasive alien species and\nHarmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are a current and\nsignificant threat to the health of coastal\necosystems\nthat\nmay\nbe\nclimate-change\nrelated. A number of medium to large-scale\nHABs impacted the northern coasts of East\nAfrica between December 2001–February 2002)\nand led to extensive fish mortality in Kenya (e.g.\nsurgeon fish, snapper, triggerfish).175\n\nIn coastal locations, ports and transport\ninfrastructure is particularly exposed, together\nwith tourism assets and settlements situated\nclose to the coast.\n\nHuman health\n\nClimate change is expected to put at risk\nhuman health by exacerbating the magnitude\nand occurrence of existing impacts, such as\nheat stress, air pollution, asthma, vector-borne\ndiseases\n(such\nas\nmalaria,\ndengue,\nschistosomiasis\n–\nalso\nreferred\nto\nas\nswimmer’s itch or snail fever – and tick-borne\ndiseases),\nwater-borne\nand\nfood-borne\ndiseases\n(such\nas\ndiarrhoeal\ndiseases).\nAccording to the World Health Organisation,\nincreasing temperatures and precipitation\npatterns arising from a changing climate in the\npast 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives\nannually,176 among which 88% of the disease\nburden afflicts children under the age of 5. The\ncurrent burden of climate-sensitive disease is\nhigh in Kenya and future climate change is\nexpected to “exacerbate the occurrence and\nintensity of future disease outbreaks and may\nincrease the spread of diseases in some\nareas”.177 For Kenya, the potential implications\nof a changing climate on health are as follows:\n\nx Geographic exposure to malaria, which is\none of the most physically and economically\ndebilitating diseases in Kenya, is predicted to\nshift due to increasing temperatures and\nchanging\ndistribution\nof\nprecipitation.\nReports indicate that the Kenyan Highlands,\nwhich were initially free of malaria, will be\nexposed to the risk of malaria following\nincreasing temperatures and precipitation.178\n179 180 In contrast, exposure will likely be\nreduced in lower altitudes.181 A recent\nmodelling study has projected that by 2055,\nas a result of the central average climate\nwarming (2.3°C) across the projections, the\n\n122\n\npopulation annually affected by malaria in\nrural areas over 1,000 metres (which\ncomprises 63.5% of the population of Kenya)\nwould increase by up to 74%. However,\nthere is controversy over the spread of\nmalaria to the Highlands because most of\nthe studies fail to integrate non-climate\nfactors, such as the decline in the control\nand treatment of the disease.182\nx Increasing annual temperature is likely to be\nresponsible for increasing prevalence of\ndiarrheal\ndisease,\nparticularly\namong\nchildren\nunder\n5\nyears.\nFurthermore,\nextreme events, especially extreme rainfall,\nwill further threaten the health of the\nincreasing population without basic sanitary\ninfrastructure and reliable waste collection\ninfrastructures.\nx Extreme events and El Niño floods are also\nlikely to lead to increasing outbreaks of\nother diseases such as cholera and rift valley\nfever.\nFor\nexample,\nrift\nvalley\nfever\noutbreaks\nin\nEast\nAfrica\nare\nclosely\nassociated with the heavy rainfall that occurs\nduring the warm phase of the ENSO\nphenomenon.183\nx In coastal areas, toxins from HABs can create\nsignificant health risks for humans and wideranging impacts on marine ecosystems. The\nmost potent HABs produce neurotoxins that\nmay be responsible for human illness or\ndeath via consumption of contaminated\nseafood, particularly bivalve molluscs (e.g.\noysters, mussels), commonly referred to as\nshellfish poisoning. During recent years there\nhas been an apparent increase in the\noccurrence of HABs in many marine and\ncoastal regions184 and a number of cases are\nreported in Kenya. This may be due to\nincreased stratification of the upper water\ncolumn, changes in ocean circulation altering\nphytoplankton assemblages and increased\nfreshwater\nrun-off\nfrom\nland\nwith\nconsequent\nnutrient\nenrichment\n(eutrophication).\n\nForestry and wildlife\n\nAnticipated impacts of climate change on\nbiodiversity\ninclude\nshift\nof\necosystem\nboundaries, change in natural habitats and\nsharp increases in extinction rates for some\nspecies.\n\nDuring the 2008-2011 drought, drought and\nindirect\nimpacts\nfrom\nwildfires\nincluded\nenvironmental losses as a result of damages to\nplant and animal species, habitats, reduced\nforest\nproductivity,\nlower\nwater\nlevels,\nincreased livestock and wildlife mortality rates.\n\nKenya’s natural resources, in particular its rich\nflora and fauna, are among the country’s most\nvaluable\nnatural\nassets.\nThe\nnatural\nenvironment is exceptionally diverse and as a\nconsequence climate-related risks will vary\ndepending on the setting.\n\nDrought, in particular, already threatens\nKenya’s rich biodiversity and species loss has\nbeen observed, while in other places, the\nnumber of indigenous and important species\nhas dwindled significantly.185 Drought also\ncauses poorer habitat suitability in terms of\nfood, water, cover and useable space, leading\nto\nwildlife\nmigration,\nmortality\nthrough\nstarvation, predation, reduced production and\nrecruitment (survival of young ones) and\nbroader\nenvironmental\ndegradation.\nIn\naddition to these extreme events, the slow\ncreeping\nchange\nin\ntemperature\nand\nprecipitation patterns over the longer-term are\nlikely to negatively impact vegetation and\nwetlands, with associated consequences for\nbirds and animals higher up the food chain.\nThe distribution of forests in Kenya is largely\ndetermined by precipitation, which means\nclimate change has the potential to cause\nsignificant forest dieback and biodiversity loss.\nThis\nwould\nhave\nassociate\ndetrimental\nconsequence for rural livelihoods that are\n\n123\n\ndependent on forest goods and services.\nForest fires are an additional hazard that is\ninfluenced by climatic conditions. Since about\n1990, Kenya has lost an average of >5,700\nhectares of forested land per year due to\nforest\nfires.186\nThe\nprojected\nrise\nin\ntemperatures and long periods of drought are\npredicted to lead to more frequent and more\nintense fires. Forest fires have in the recent\npast affected Kenya’s major forests, including\nthe Mount Kenya forest fire in February/March\n2012.\n\nUrban and housing\n\nClimate change is likely to make rural livelihood\nstrategies and living conditions increasingly\nchallenging and as a result is likely to\nexaggerate the rural-to-urban migration trend\nKenya is currently experiencing. Specific risks\nand challenges for communities, especially\nthose living in urban environments and\nparticularly the most vulnerable, include river\nand flash flooding, with flood related fatalities\nconstituting 60 per cent of disaster victims in\nKenya. Extreme events and particularly El Niño\nrains are likely to undermine the health of\nKenya’s inhabitants directly through increasing\nnumbers of injuries and deaths and indirectly\nthrough\nwater\nquality\nissues\nand\nfood\ninsecurity. Drought and associated water\nscarcity, in particular, have the potential to\nexacerbate existing inequalities. Women in\nKenya\nhave\nbeen\nobserved\nto\nbe\ndisproportionately affected by drought because\npre-existing gender discrimination exposes\nthem to higher rates of poverty and insecurity\nand because of the extra socio-economic\nburden they have meeting the needs of\nhouseholds, children, the vulnerable and the\nelderly.\n\nArid and semi-arid lands\n\nThe influx of civil strife and drought-driven\nrefugees to northern Kenya creates challenges\nfor the ASAL economy and natural resource\nbase. According to UNHCR, Kenya hosted\n650,000 refugees located in three camps in\n2012. KFS reported that 11.3 million tonnes of\nfuelwood were cut by the refugees from an\narea of 80-km radius over three years. The\nrecovery of these resources will take a long\ntime in the pastoral areas.\n\nOver the past few decades, transformations in\nthe ASALs have impacted on the livelihoods of\nthe pastoralists. Migration of rural communities\nfrom the congested high-potential areas and\nthe dry arid areas to cities has contributed to\noverpopulated slums and settlements that lack\nbasic services. The dwellers of the slums in turn\ncontinue to migrate to the semi-arid areas and\npursue non-pastoral activities such as cropping\nin grazing lands not well suited for agriculture.\n\nThe 2008-2011 drought in Kenya had profound\nimpacts on many communities, destroying\nlivelihoods and increasing vulnerability. In\npastoralist areas where men are traditionally\nresponsible for livestock, reduced herd sizes\nforced men to migrate to urban centres for\nwage employment. This had implications for\nwomen and children due to the additional\nburden of sustaining household food, water and\nhuman security. School attendance rates\ndecreased, child labour increased and conflicts\nover resources were observed to intensify.\n\nTourism\n\nWith its close connections to the environment\nand climate itself, tourism is considered to be a\nhighly climate-sensitive industry.187 A wide\nrange\nof\nclimate-induced\nenvironmental\nchanges will have profound effects on tourism\nat the local and regional destination level.\n\nChanges in water availability, biodiversity loss\nand reduced landscape aesthetics, increased\nnatural\nhazards,\ncoastal\nerosion\nand\ninundation and the increasing incidence of\n\n124\n\nvector-borne diseases will all impact the\ntourism industry to varying degrees. However\nlimited research has been undertaken on the\nimpacts of climate change on tourism in Kenya.\n\nManufacturing, Transport and Trade\n\nClimate change has the potential to impact\nmanufacturing, retail and trade sectors across a\nrange of economic scales, from individual\nbusinesses\noperating\nin\nmanufacturing,\nwholesale and retail through to the national\neconomy and international trade. Impacts to\ncritical supporting infrastructure, such as\nenergy, water, communications and transport,\nhave the potential to reverberate into the\nprivate sector, with consequences for business\ncontinuity, revenue, workforce and associated\nsupply chains.\nClimate induced changes in productivity in the\ntea, coffee and vegetables subsectors have\nimplications for exports and imports. For\nexample, recent crop failure in maize resulted in\nthe importation of 2.6 million bags between\n2008 and 2009, worth Ksh 6.7 billion.188\n\nReduced output of hydropower that resulted\nfrom 2008-2011 drought reduced revenue for\nthe electricity utility, Kenya Power Company by\nKsh 2.6 billion. Likewise, the Kenyan electricity\nproducer KenGen also reported a downward\ntrend in their revenue in late 2010, totalling Ksh\n1.25 billion.189 Reduced hydropower production\nwas accompanied by an increased share of\nthermal power generation at a higher cost of\ngeneration. The losses due to higher production\ncosts are estimated to be about Ksh 29.8 billion\ncontributing to total cumulative losses of\napproximately Ksh 32.4 billion.\n\nClimate change is a potential “external\nshock” to the financial services sector for\nexample through exposure to indirect risks\nto\ninvestment\nportfolios,\nand\nretail\ncustomers defaulting on loans, and to\ninsurance through increased risks leading to\nhigh claim ratios and lower uptake of\ninsurance cover.\n\nInfrastructure (for energy and transport)\n\nA range of climate drivers have the potential\nto\ncompromise\ninfrastructure\ndesign,\nfunction and performance across a range of\nsettings. In coastal locations, ports and\ntransport\ninfrastructure\nis\nparticularly\nexposed, together with tourism assets and\nsettlements situated close to the coast.\nRiverine flooding and landslides have the\npotential to cause significant damage to\nphysical\ninfrastructure\nsuch\nas\nroads,\nbridges, water pipelines and power lines,\nresulting\nin\nwidespread\ndisruption,\na\nrequirement\nfor\nadditional\ncapital\nexpenditure\nand\nwider\nenvironmental\ndamage. Droughts cause underperformance\nof hydroelectric power infrastructure, with\npower generation in periods of drought\nreduced by almost 40 per cent of normal\nyears.190\n\nPRIORITY ADAPTATION OPTIONS\n\nThe development of the draft National\nAdaptation\nPlan\n(NAP)\nincluded\nthe\nidentification of criteria, which were used to\nselect priority actions under each Medium Term\nPlan theme. The criteria were weighted to\nensure\nactions\naddressing\nexisting\nvulnerabilities scored highly. Projected changes\nwere addressed through the selection of no and\nlow\nregrets\nmeasures,\nincorporation\nof\nknowledge of future climate change into\ndecisions on long-lived fixed assets and policies,\nand identifying where a long lead-in decision\ntimeline is required before an action can take\neffect. Adaptation priorities identified and\nelaborated in the NAP are listed below in Table\n\n48. These priorities are based on risk and\nvulnerability assessments across the MTP II\nsectors, and build on NCCAP priority actions in a\n\n125\n\nwide range of sectors. For details, reference is\nmade to the NCCAP and the ATAR.\n\n126\n\nTable 39: Adaptation priorities identified and elaborated in the NAP\nx MTP SECTOR\nx PRIORITY ADAPTATION ACTIONS\nx Energy\nx Increase the resilience of current and future energy systems*\nx Science, Technology and\ninnovations\nx Support innovation and development of appropriate technologies that\npromote climate resilient development*\nPublic sector reforms\nIntegrate climate change adaptation into the public sector reforms\nx Human\nResource\nDevelopment, Labour and\nEmployment\nx Enhance adaptive capacity and resilience of the informal private sector\nx Infrastructure\nx Climate proofing of infrastructure (energy, roads, buildings, ICT)*\nx Land Reforms\nx Mainstream climate change adaptation in land reforms*\nEducation and training\nEnhance awareness, education and training in climate change adaptation across\npublic and private sectors\nHealth\nStrengthen integration of climate change adaptation into the health sector*\nEnvironment\nEnhance climate information services\nEnhance the resilience of ecosystems to climate variability and change*\nWater and irrigation\nMainstream of climate change adaptation in the water sector by implementing the\nNational Water Master Plan (2014)*\nPopulation, urbanisation and\nhousing\nEnhance the adaptive capacity of the population, urbanisation and housing sector*\nGender, Vulnerable Groups and\nYouth\nStrengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups (lactating women, children\nunder 5, elderly, sick, physically challenged) through social safety nets and insurance\nschemes\nTourism\nEnhance the resilience of the tourism value chain\nAgriculture, livestock\ndevelopment and fisheries\nEnhance the resilience of the agriculture, livestock and fisheries value chains by\npromoting climate smart agriculture and livestock development*\nPrivate Sector/ Trade;\nManufacturing; Business\nProcess Outsourcing, Financial\nservices\nCreate enabling environment for the resilience of private sector investment,\ndemonstrate an operational business case*\nOil and mineral resources\nIntegrate climate change adaptation into the extractive sector, including climate\nproofing of infrastructure*\nDevolution\nMainstream climate change adaptation into county integrated development plans\n* Denotes adaptation actions that have mitigation co-benefits.\n\nADAPTATION GOVERNANCE\n\nThe following organisations constitute part of\nthe governance framework for adaptation in\nKenya:\n\nx The Climate Change Secretariat, MENRRDA\nleads the work on adaptation, including the\ndevelopment of the NAP and implementation\nof the NCCAP.\nx NEMA is the National Designated Authority\nfor the CDM and the National Implementing\nEntity\nmanaging\nactivities\nunder\nthe\nAdaptation Fund.\nx The Vision 2030 Secretariat, Ministry of\n\n127\n\nPlanning and Devolution, is undertaking work\nto assess adaptation and mitigation in flagship\nprojects.\nx The Ministry of Planning and Devolution is\ndeveloping climate change indicators in its\nHandbook to measure progress under the\nMTP2.\nx County government are developing climate\nchange indicators to track progress under\ntheir County Integrated Development Plans.\nx The National Drought Management Authority\nundertakes activities on drought management\nand emergency preparedness that improve\nadaptive capacity.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nStockholm Environment Institute (SEI) (2009).\nThe Economics of Climate Change in Kenya.\nDFID, DANIDA.\nDowning, C., Preston, F., Parusheva, D.,\nHorrocks, L., Edberg, O., Samazzi, F.,\nWashington, R., Muteti, M., Watkiss, P. and\nNyangena,\nW.\n(2008).\nKenya:\nClimate\nScreening and Information Exchange.

Such measures may either reduce\nthe increase in greenhouse gas emissions\n(abatement) or increase terrestrial storage of\ncarbon (sequestration). All the measures have to\nbe in compliance with the applicable national and\ninternational agreements, policies and legislation.\n\nAlthough developing countries are not required to\ntake on emission reduction commitments, Kenya\nviews undertaking climate change mitigation and\nassessment\nas\na\nmeans\nto\nsustainable\ndevelopment. For the country, undertaking\nmitigation evaluation analysis also facilitates the\nimplementation\nof\nmitigation\nprojects,\nstrengthening of institutional and human capacitybuilding and the prioritisation and evaluation of\nsocial, economic and environmental programmes.\n\nThis\nchapter\npresents\nKenya’s\nmitigation\nevaluation analysis, describing the low-carbon\nassessment undertaken in the six mitigation\nsectors: energy, transport, industry, agriculture,\nforestry and waste management. The assessment\npresented in this report is based on the Mitigation\nchapter of the NCCAP, but with updated data and\ninformation. Detailed analysis of the development\nscenarios were carried out during the NCCAP\nprocess in 2012. Therefore, this report does not\nattempt to conduct assessment of the country’s\nlow carbon development pathway with new\ndevelopment scenarios. It however updates the\ndetailed assessment carried out during the NCCAP\n\nprocess by applying the latest available data and\ninformation, some of which were not available at\nthe time of developing the NCCAP.\n\nAs per the NCCAP, the assessment – which\nincludes a bottom-up assessment of mitigation\nopportunities and a top-down economy-wide\neconomic, energy and emissions model – provides\nthe evidence base for prioritising low-carbon\ndevelopment\nopportunities\nand,\nultimately,\ndeveloping investment proposals to attract\ninternational climate finance through nationally\nappropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) and\nreducing emissions from deforestation and forest\ndegradation plus the role of conservation,\nsustainable\nmanagement\nof\nforests\nand\nenhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+).\n\nMETHODOLOGY FOR THE MITIGATION\nASSESSMENT\n\nWithin the framework of Kenya’s national\ncircumstances and the country’s sustainable\ndevelopment objectives, Kenya has used available\nand appropriate methods in order to formulate\nand prioritise programmes containing measures to\nmitigate climate change. The measures applied\ninclude social, economic and environmental\nfactors.\n\nThe mitigation assessments conducted by Kenya\nentail the generation of information on the\nnational analysis of the potential costs and\nimpacts of the various technologies and practices\nto mitigate climate change, which are relevant for\nsustainable development and useful for policy\nmaking\nwith\nregard\nto\nformulation\nand\nprioritisation of mitigation programmes.\n\nUnder Subcomponent 4 of the NCCAP, a detailed\ntechnical analysis was undertaken to identify the\nmain elements of a low-carbon development\n\n135\n\npathway, recognising that the pathway needs to\nemphasise sustainable development and climate\nresilience co-benefits. This view was supported by\nstakeholders and experts through an extensive\nconsultation and validation process. The NCCAP’s\nlow carbon analysis carried out under the NCCAP\nprocess, and updated in this Second National\nCommunications, demonstrate that mitigation\nactions can contribute to low-carbon pathways in\nthe six sectors set out in the UNFCCC: energy,\ntransport, industry, agriculture, forestry and\nwaste. However, some of the sector baseline\nemissions are different as the Second National\nCommunications has applied the latest available\ndata. The emission reduction options and their\npotential however remain the same as those\ndetermined in the NCCAP. The general\nmethodology used to develop the low-carbon\nscenario assessment for the NCAPP is outlined in\nFigure 46. A detailed description of the\nmethodology is provided in Chapter 6 of the\nNCCAP.\n\nFigure 46: General methodology used to develop the low-carbon scenario assessment for the NCAPP\nThe mitigation assessment presented in this\nsection deviates from the NCCAP work identified\nin Figure 45 in only a few small ways. A new\nemissions reference case or business as usual\n\n136\n\nscenario is developed using the historical GHG\nemissions developed and presented in Chapter 2\nas well as from new available historical data from\n2011, 2012 and 2013. As a result emissions\nprojected for each sector to 2030 vary from the\nNCCAP work. In some cases this changes expected\nenergy demand or economic activity which affects\nthe emission reduction potential of the mitigation\noptions investigated under the NCCAP. Out of the\n31 mitigation actions considered under the NCCAP\napproximately 11 mitigation actions in the\nelectricity generation and energy demand sectors\nrequired significant updates due to baseline\nchanges.\n\nThe NCCAP provides full details of a range of\nadaptation and mitigation actions in the context\nof a low carbon climate resilient development\npathway. The actions have not been affected by\nthe updated data and the potentials are exactly as\nspecified in the NCCAP. The big wins identified will\nmake a significant impact on sustainable socioeconomic\ndevelopment,\nadaptation\nand\nmitigation in Kenya. They include:\nx Geothermal power generation\nx Restoration of forests on degraded lands and\nreforestation of degraded forests\nx Climate smart agriculture and agroforestry\nx Improved cookstoves\nx Mass rapid transit system in Nairobi, including\nbus rapid transit with light rail transit corridors\n\nAll these ‘big win’ opportunities combine climate\nresilience and mitigation benefits and capture\nover two-thirds of the mitigation potential\nidentified in the NCCAP low carbon assessment.\nMore specific mitigation actions proposed for\neach national planning sector are presented in this\nreport.\n\nEMISSION BASELINE PROJECTION\n\nAn assessment of mitigation options to be\nundertaken as Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\n\nActions (NAMAs) or other appropriate mitigation\nprogrammes requires that there is a projection of\nexpected baseline or business as usual emissions\ninto the future that accounts for existing\ngovernment policies from which to consider the\nimpact of individual NAMAs. It is important that\nthis projection reflects only existing policies,\nregulations and financial commitments and does\nnot account for potential new policies or account\nfor financing that is speculative in nature. For this\nreason, targets and goals expressed by the GoK in\nVision 2030 and elsewhere, have not been\nconsidered as constituting the baseline, unless\nappropriate policies have been put in place and\nfunds committed to reach them.\n\nThis section describes the methods used to\nproject baseline emissions for Kenya out to 2030\nfor the entire Kenyan economy and by sector and\nthen presents the results. The method applied is\nin line with the assessment done in the NCCAP.\nHowever, the data and information used for this\nchapter\nof\nKenya’s\nSecond\nNational\nCommunications has been updated to reflect new\ninformation and data that has been generated\nsince the NCCAP was prepared in 2012. The\ninformation is organised by the following seven\nsectors used for analysis in the low-carbon\nscenario analysis of the NCCAP:\n\nx Energy demand\nx Electricity generation\nx Transportation\nx Industrial processes\nx Agriculture\n\n137\n\nx Forestry\nx Waste.\n\nFinal projections of the baseline emissions for\neach sector out to 2030 are illustrated in Figure\n47.\n\nFigure 47: Emission Baseline Projection for Kenya (MtCO2e)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nIndustrial Processes\nEnergy Demand\nTransportation\nLULUCF\nElectricity Generation\nAgriculture\n\nSector\nBaseline Emissions (MtCO2e)\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nAgriculture\n30\n23\n26\n30\n32\n34\n36\n39\nElectricity Generation\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n12\n24\n40\nLULUCF\n12\n21\n18\n21\n26\n25\n23\n20\nTransportation\n4\n4\n4\n7\n9\n12\n16\n17\nEnergy Demand\n4\n5\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nIndustrial Processes\n1\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nWaste\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\nTOTAL\n52\n55\n57\n70\n80\n96\n115\n138\n\nIn the reference case, emissions increase up until\n2030 in all sectors except LULUCF:\n\nx Electricity emissions grow the most, increasing\nfrom 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide\nequivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010 to 40 MtCO2e in\n2030. Much of this increase is attributed to new\ncoal and natural gas coming online to meet\nincreasing energy demand.\n\n138\n\nx Forestry sector emissions are likely to decline\nafter 2020 due to the reduced clearing of forests\nand increases in the number and size of trees, a\nresult of tree planting programmes and a\nreduced projection in wood harvesting.\nx Agriculture and forestry sectors are the largest\nemitters, accounting for approximately 75 per\ncent of emissions in 2010 and 45 per cent in\n2030, mainly due to emissions from livestock\nand deforestation.\nx Emissions in other sectors grow significantly,\nwith transport emissions increasing by about\nthree times between 2010 and 2030, and\nemissions from the waste sector and energy\ndemand doubling in the same time period.\n\nEnergy Demand\n\nThe Energy demand sector includes all fuel\ncombustion emission sources that are not related\nto the electricity generation sector and the\ntransport sector. This includes fossil and biomass\n fuels consumed by residential, commercial,\nindustrial, agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors.\nFuture growth in petroleum product consumption\nin the Energy Demand Sector was estimated based\non the overall historic growth of all fossil fuels\nbetween 2000 and 2009. This total growth was\nestimated to be 3.4% per year. The growth rate in\ncoal consumption was based on the demand for\nenergy to meet future cement production,\nestimated to increase by 5% annually. Future\nbiomass consumption data were available from a\nUNEP study and these were used to estimate the\nbiomass growth rates.191 Table 49 summarises the\nassumptions that are used to develop the\nprojections of the inventory emissions between\n2011 and 2030.

Historical information on the total\nconsumption of different energy consumers\n(urban households, rural households, commercial\nand industry) is available from the data on\npetroleum fuels sales and a number of reports.\nHowever,\nthere\nis\nlittle\ncomprehensive\ninformation available on the end-use demand\nwhere these fuels are ultimately consumed, such\nas for cooking, lighting and heating water. A large\nnumber of reports provide details on usage\npatterns of households and ownership of\nappliances but this data only indirectly indicates\nactual energy consumption. Other data, especially\nfor biomass consumption, was often found to be\ncontradictory and therefore not reliable.\n\nEnd-use allocation is based on estimates from\nexperts and from the literature. There is no\ncomprehensive source of information in Kenya on\nthe historical end-use consumption patterns of\ndifferent consumers of biomass and fossil fuels. A\nlarge number of documents were reviewed that\nprovided some evidence of end-use consumption\npatterns or ownership of appliances specific to\ncertain fuels but this data was seldom aggregated\nto the national level or only indirectly indicated\nactual energy consumption.\n\nFor example, there was detailed data on the\ndistribution of cooking devices used by urban and\nrural households, but this data only indirectly\nindicated fuel consumption. Additional data or\nassumptions were required in order to estimate\nhow much fuel and what type of fuel was\nconsumed. Expert opinion or detailed end-use fuel\nconsumption patterns from other countries were\nin some cases used to identify the share of fuel\nused by different end-uses. As a result, there is a\nfair degree of uncertainty associated with the enduse allocation and a number of the estimates are\nnot Kenyan specific. However, the uncertainty in\nend-use allocation does not affect overall\nestimates of emissions, but it does impact the\nuncertainty associated with estimates of the\npotential for mitigation where specific end-uses\nare targeted.\n\nTable 51 summarises the allocation of different\nfuels to both consumers and specific end-uses.\nThe cement industrial sector is separated from the\nenergy consumption of all other industry.\n\nAdditives\n3,308\n4,613\n6,116\n8,108\n10,752\nFuelwood\n434,691\n457,966\n482,543\n508,495\n535,905\nCharcoal\n56,488\n60,176\n64,105\n68,291\n72,749\nAgricultural Residues\n82,630\n94,984\n109,186\n125,511\n144,277\n\n141\n\n142\n\nTable 42: Estimate of end-use consumption by fuel and consumer (%)\n\nEnd-Use Consumption by Fuel and Consumer (%)\nFuel\nConsumer\nTotal Fuel Share by\nConsumer\nCooking\nHot Water\nIndustrial\nProcess\nLighting\nKerosene\nUrban\n58%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n58%\nRural\n25%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n25%\nCommercial\n11%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n11%\nOther Industrial\n6%\n0%\n0%\n6%\n0%\nFuel Oil\nCommercial\n46%\n0%\n37%\n0%\n9%\nCement\n22%\n0%\n0%\n22%\n0%\nIndustrial\n32.2%\n0%\n0%\n54%\n0%\nHeavy Diesel\nOil\nCommercial\n70.7%\n0%\n57%\n0%\n14%\nIndustrial\n29.3%\n0%\n0%\n29%\n0%\nLubricants\nIndustrial\n100%\n0%\n0%\n100%\n0%\nLPG\nUrban\n44.7%\n45%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nRural\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nCommercial\n44.7%\n45%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n10.7%\n0%\n0%\n11%\n0%\nCoal\nCement\n100%\n0%\n0%\n100%\n0%\nAgricultural\nResidues\nUrban\n20%\n17%\n1%\n0%\n2%\nRural\n60%\n51%\n3%\n0%\n6%\nCommercial\n10%\n8%\n2%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n10%\n0%\n0%\n10%\n0%\nFuelwood\nUrban\n5%\n4%\n0%\n0%\n1%\nRural\n80%\n68%\n4%\n0%\n8%\nCommercial\n10%\n8%\n2%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n5%\n0%\n0%\n5%\n0%\nCharcoal\nUrban\n75%\n75%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nRural\n20%\n20%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nCommercial\n5%\n5%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n\n143\n\nElectricity Generation\n\nDeveloping a baseline projection for Kenya’s\nelectricity sector is challenging because there is\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding how the sector\nmay grow to meet a large suppressed demand for\nelectricity. Specific plans are in place but they\nassume very high growth rates. The Updated\nLeast Cost Power Development Plan (ULCPDP)\npresumes a 14% per annum growth rate in\nelectricity supply between 2010 and 2030 in their\nreference case.192 This compares to historical\ngrowth in electricity supply of about 7% between\n2000 and 2010. The cost to achieve this dramatic\ngrowth is estimated at U.S$ 41.4 billion (excluding\ncommitted\nprojects)\nwhile\ngeneration\ntechnologies that are expected to make up the\nvast majority of new supply still face considerable\nbarriers to implementation.193 Technologies such\nas nuclear, coal and wind have either not been\nproven in Kenya or have limited current\npenetration. Geothermal, which is expected to\ncomprise the largest portion of generation, has\nhigh initial costs, long lead times and risk of\nresource exploration that must be overcome.\n\nThe baselines outlined in the NCAPP and in this\nsection are in line with each other but they are not\nidentical to the reference case in the Updated\nLeast Cost Power Development Plan.194 This is\nbecause the objective of the baseline emissions\nforecast is to consider a scenario based on existing\npolicies and regulations and assume no growth in\ninternational\naid\nand\nrelated\ninternational\ninvestments.\nSpecifically,\nany\nadditional\ninternational\nsupport\nand\ninvestment\nfor\nelectricity generation projects that may be tied to\nlow-carbon development are not included in the\nemissions reference case, unless the international\nsupport and related investments have already\nbeen committed. Including such international\nsupport would mean that\nthe\nsubstantial\nrenewable generation investment in geothermal,\nwind and small hydro in the aspiration of Vision\n2030 reference case could not be part of a NAMA,\nfor\nexample.\nConsequently,\nincluding\nthis\npotential investment in the baseline would mean\nthat billions of dollars in investment opportunity\nthrough the development of NAMAs and other\nmitigation projects could not be considered in the\nmitigation\nscenario.\n\nFigure 48\nFigure 48 compares the total installed capacity between 2010\nand 2030 presented in the reference case adopted in this\nlow-carbon analysis to the reference case in the Updated\nLeast Cost Power Development Plan.195\n\n144\n\nFigure 48: Comparison of installed capacity between 2010 and 2030\n0\n2,000\n4,000\n6,000\n8,000\n10,000\n12,000\n14,000\n16,000\n18,000\n20,000\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nInstalled Capacity (MW)\nULCDP\nReference\nCase\nReference\nCase\n\nRevised projections of short-term generating\ncapacity installations were provided by the then\nMinistry of Energy (now Ministry of Energy and\nPetroleum).196 Table 52 outlines the new\ngeneration capacity that is included in the\nbaseline for the years between 2012 and 2017.\n\n145\n\nTable 43: Information provided from the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum on new capacity additions\nNew Additions to Capacity Between 2012 and 2017\nNew power plants and generating\ncapacity that will come online in the\nnext five years\n2012\nHYDRO 21MW – Sang\nGeothermal 2.3 MW – Eburru\nGeothermal 75 MW – Olkaria\n2013\nWind 60MW - Aeolus\nMSD 81MW - Triumph\nMSD 84MW - Gulf\nMSD 87MW - Melec\nMSD 80MW – Muhoroni\nWind 6.8 MW - Ngong\n2014\nGeothermal 140 MW – Olk4\nWind 300 MW - Turkana\nGeothermal 36 MW - Olk3\nWind 50 MW - Osiwo\nHydro 32 MW- Kindaruma\nGeothermal 140 MW - Olk 1 – 4&5\n2015\nGeothermal 280MW\nHydro 6 MW – small hydro\n2016\nIMPORT 400MW\nCoal 600MW - Mombasa\n2017\nGeothermal 140MW\nGeothermal 45MW\n\nFor years beyond 2017, the baseline projection\ndeviates from the Updated Least Cost Power\nDevelopment Plan 2011 reference case in order to\nreflect a baseline that is based on existing policies\nand regulations and assumes no growth in\ninternational\naid\nand\nrelated\ninternational\ninvestments, specifically assuming no additional\ninternational support that would be tied to\nNAMAs or similar mitigation activities. Since there\nis no gas generation in the medium term, the\nanalysis adopts the trend identified in the ULCDP.\nImports also assumed follow the same trend as\nthe ULCDP. All other technologies including coal,\nmedium-speed diesel (MSD), wind, hydro and\ngeothermal are based on the same rate of growth\ngeneration capacity that is installed in the medium\nterm plan (2012 to 2017). In the baseline it is\nassumed that no nuclear energy will be added\nbefore 2030. Figure 49 compares the installed\ncapacity of different technologies in 2030 in the\nreference case adopted in the low-carbon analysis\nto the reference case that is presented in the\nUpdated Least Cost Power Development Plan.197\n\n146\n\nFigure 49: Comparison of installed capacity in 2030 (MW)\n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCapacity in 2030 (MW)\nBaseline Projection\nULCDP Reference\n\nTotal generation capacity under the GHG\nemissions reference case is 11,191 MW in 2030\nversus from 17,220 MW under the Updated Least\nCost Power Development Plan.

The summarised\ninvestment costs for implementing the six low\ncarbon options to 2030 are shown on Table 66.\nThe details of these costs are provided in the\nNCCAP.\n\nThe methodology used for calculating these primary\ncosts is detailed in the Low Carbon – Mitigation\nAnnexes of the NCCAP. It is estimated that KSh839\n– 1,110 billion of these investment costs would\nhave to be borne by the public sector, with the\nremaining costs covered by private sector and\nhousehold investments. Kenya sees clear potential\nto make effective use of bilateral and multilateral\nfunding, as well as international climate finance\nmechanisms – such as the Green Climate Fund\nand emerging NAMAs and REDD+ mechanisms– in\nmoving forward with the implementation of these\nactions.\n\nTable 57: Projected investment costs for priority mitigation actions\n\n153\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\n\n154\n\nSUMMARY OF MITIGATION ACTIONS\n\nBased\non\nthe\ncomprehensive\nbottom-up\nassessment in the NCCAP and the update\nconducted during the preparation of the Second\nNational Communication, six proposed priority\nareas for low carbon development and proposals\nfor their implementation are described in Table 67\nbelow. These six priority areas cover about threequarters of total abatement potentials found in\nthis study. Their full deployment would almost\nhalve GHG emissions by 2030 compared to the\nreference\ncase\nscenario\n(cross-sectoral\ninteractions not taken into account). Investment\ncosts would vary, but significant reductions can be\nobtained at marginal costs of less than US$15 per\ntonne of carbon. Some of these options also\ndeliver fuel savings, which may result in overall\nsocial cost savings relative to high emitting\noptions.\n\nSignificant investments will be required and a\nseries of barriers will need to be addressed before\nthe low-carbon opportunities can be realised.\nImplementing the six priority low carbon actions\nwould require investments of KSh 1,371 – 1,773\nbillion (USD 16.12 – 20.84 billion) until 2030\n(equivalent to a Net Present Value of KSh600 –\n770 billion at a real discount rate of 10 per cent).\nOut of these investment costs, it is estimated that\nKSh839 – 1,110 billion would have to be borne by\nthe public sector, with the remaining costs\ncovered\nby\nprivate\nsector\nand\nhousehold\ninvestments. A large challenge is financing the\nhigher upfront costs of low carbon investments.\nKenya sees clear potential to make effective use of\nbilateral and multilateral funding, as well as\ninternational climate finance mechanisms – such\nas the Green Climate Fund and the international\nsupport likely to be mobilised to support the\nemerging NAMA and REDD+ mechanisms– in\nmoving forward on the Action Plan, in addition to\nsystematic domestic support.\n\n155\n\n156\n\n157\n\nTable 60: Summary of Mitigation Actions\nNumber\nAction\nEstimated Cost\nKSh to 2030\nMITI-1\n\nRestoration of Forests on Degraded Lands -Undertake a programme of\nwork to restore forests on 960,000 hectares up to 2030 including: inter alia\ndryland forest restoration activities; awareness raising, consultation and\ndemonstration; capacity building; development, testing and application of\ncompensation and benefits-sharing mechanisms; measuring, monitoring and\nti\nd\nh\n186-290billion\n\nMITI-2\n\nGeothermal - Develop an additional 2,275 MW of geothermal capacity by\n2030 through a support programme aimed at encouraging private sector\ninvestment.

While strong growth will likely continue due to high\ndemand projected average growth between 2010 and 2030 is\nestimated to be somewhat lower than this historical growth rate.\nGrowth in 2010 was approximately 6%.\nGrowth in Service\nDemand (vehicle\nkm travelled)\n+1% per year\nIncreased travel per vehicle is likely as this is a trend that has been\nobserved in most countries where road networks are being expanded\nas is the case in Kenya; however, this growth rate is expected to be\nvery small due to the limited capacity of current roadways to handle\nboth new vehicle stock and additional traffic.\nChange in fuel\nefficiency of\npassenger\nvehicles\n+1.8% per year\nHistoric improvements between 2000 and 2010 in average fleet wide\nfuel efficiency are low. This may be explained by the fact that average\ncar size, and proportion of trucks and SUV vehicles increased over the\nlast decade. We assume that fuel efficiency will improve at an\nincreased rate going forward. New fuel efficiency is based on a fleet\nturnover rate of 4% (average lifetime of vehicle 25 years) and an\naverage improvement in fuel economy of new vehicles compared to\non-road vehicles determined from fuel economy data for Japanese\nvehicles. The average improvements in fuel economy for new vehicles\nis 33% for passenger vehicles,\n\n160\n\nChange in fuel\nefficiency of\nfreight vehicles\n+1.2% per year\nHistoric improvements between 2000 and 2010 in average fleet wide\nfuel efficiency are low. This may be explained by the fact that average\ncar size, and proportion of trucks and SUV vehicles increased over the\nlast decade. We assume that fuel efficiency will improve at an\nincreased rate going forward. New fuel efficiency is based on a fleet\nturnover rate of 4% (average lifetime of vehicle 25 years) and an\naverage improvement in fuel economy of new vehicles compared to\non-road vehicles determined from fuel economy data for Japanese\nvehicles. The average improvements in fuel economy is 25% for freight\nvehicles.\n\nRail, marine and domestic aviation sub-sectors\nwere assumed to have an average demand growth\nof 4.4%. This growth rate is in line with current\nprojections for the economy and business as usual\nestimates in the growth rate of transport\npetroleum demand in a UNEP study.198 An average\nimprovement in fuel efficiency of 1% was\nassumed.\nThis\nefficiency\nimprovement\nis\nconsistent with an increase in rail fuel efficiency of\n1.1% per year in the United States between 1990\nand 2006.199\n\nIn order to look at low-carbon options that\ndifferentiate between personal passenger, bus\nand freight vehicles it is necessary to divide the\ntotal consumption of on-road transportation fuels\nindicated in Table 98 into these end-uses. This is\nchallenging because there is limited information\non the fuel usage by end-use in Kenya. The basis\nfor the on-road allocation by end-use was vehicle\nregistration data between 2000 and 2006200 and\ndetailed vehicle registration data on new vehicles\navailable for 2005 and 2008.201 Table 60 below\nindicates the distribution by on-road vehicle type.\nPassenger vehicles include all personal passenger\nvehicles including motorcycles.\n\nTable 51: Distribution of vehicle types in Kenya based on historic data\nType\nHistoric Fleet (2006)\nPassenger Vehicles\n85.8%\nBuses\n5.3%\nFreight Vehicles\n8.9%\nTOTAL\n100%\n\nNew vehicle registration data between 2005 and\n2008202 indicates that approximately 22% of the\nnewly registered vehicles in this period were\ndiesel and 78% were gasoline. There are several\n\n161\n\nreasons why this historic share is likely not\nindicative of the average share in the on-road fleet\nof vehicles.\n\nTable 52: Share of vehicles by fuel type for passenger, buses and freight vehicles\nVehicle Type\nFuel\n% Share\nVehicles in 2010\nPersonal Passenger\nVehicles\nDiesel\n32%\n329,475\nPetrol\n68%\n700,135\nALL\n100%\n1,029,610\nBuses\nDiesel\n90.0%\n57,169\nPetrol\n10.0%\n6,352\nALL\n100.0%\n63,521\nFreight Vehicles\nDiesel\n90.0%\n96,182\nPetrol\n10.0%\n10,687\nALL\n100.0%\n106,869\nTOTAL\nDiesel\n40%\n482,826\nTOTAL\nPetrol\n60%\n717,174\nTOTAL\nTOTAL\n100%\n1,200,000\n\nFirst, is the rising share of gasoline vehicles in\nrecent years and second, is that vehicle lifetime\nfor diesel vehicles is on average longer. Based on\nthese factors, the share of passenger diesel\nvehicles was adjusted to 32% of the total, and the\nshare of diesel buses and freight vehicles was\nadjusted to 90%. Table 61 indicates the vehicle\ntype and fuel shares used in the model.\n\nTotal projections of on-road vehicle population by\nfuel and vehicle type are shown in Figure 51\nrelative to the total Kenyan population (black\n\nline). This figure illustrates that the number of\nvehicles is expected to increase significantly faster\nthan for overall population. In 2010 vehicle\n\nownership was approximately 30.7 vehicles per\nthousand population. This level of ownership\nmore than doubles in 2030 to 69.9 vehicles per\nthousand population.\n\nFigure 51: On-road vehicle population growth in Kenya (millions)\n\n162\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nKenya Population (millions)\nOn-Road Vehicle Population (millions)\nFreight Vehicles\nPetrol\nFreight Vehicles\nDiesel\nBuses Petrol\nBuses Diesel\nPassenger Vehicles\nPetrol\nPassenger Vehicles\nDiesel\nPopulation Millions\n\nBaseline projections of transportation emissions\nbroken down by fuel type and major end-use is\nindicated in Figure 52.\n\nFigure 52: Baseline greenhouse gas emission projections for the transportation sector\n\n163\n\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nHeavy diesel oil Navigation\nGasoline - Freight\nVehicles\nJet Kerosene Aviation\nLight diesel oil Freight Vehicles\nGasoline - Passenger\nVehicles\nLight diesel oil Passenger Vehicles\n\nIndustrial Processes\nIn Kenya the main industrial processes emission\nsources\nare\nreleases\nfrom\nprocesses\nthat\nchemically or physically transform materials (for\nexample, cement, lime and soda ash are notable\nexamples where there are processes that release\na significant amount of CO2).

The\nprobability of transitioning a parcel of land from\none state (a particular land-use classification) to\nanother is defined in the model based on available\ndata on land-use change, management activities\nand disturbances.\nProjections of land-use changes and biomass\nremovals (e.g., wood, charcoal, timber) that\nimpact emissions and removals from LULUCF\nbetween 2011 and 2030 are based on a number of\ndifferent assumptions which are summarised in\nTable 64.\nTable 55: Projection assumptions for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry\nEmission /\nRemoval\nCategory\nMetric\nAssumption\nNotes\nConversion of\nForest Land to\nFarm lands\nHa converted\nper year\nbetween 1990\nand 2010\nReduced by\n50% between\n2010 and 2030\nIncreased protection and forest management under the\nForest Conservation And Management Bill, 2014 is expected\nto reduce the rate of deforestation.

The breakdown of\nhuman sewage can also lead to significant\namounts of indirect N2O emissions.\nHistoric solid waste data disposal was estimated\nfrom Environmental Impact Assessments for four\nsolid waste disposal sites in Kenya (Dandora,\nMombasa, Kisumu and Nakuru).

In addition, there has been a strong focus\non expanding geothermal power, which is\nconsidered a key enabler for Kenya’s economic\ngrowth. Although geothermal is the most\npromising renewable energy source, Kenya also\nhas excellent bioenergy, solar, wind and hydro\nresources for the supply of electricity.\n\nThe analysis of six low carbon development\noptions for electricity supply (Figure 58) shows\nthat geothermal power has by far the largest\nabatement potential (14 MtCO2e per year) in\n2030, with other technologies varying between\n0.5 and 1.4 MtCO2e. Increasing the share of\nrenewable electricity can have benefits in terms of\nenergy security (through decreased energy\nimports) and reduced costs of generation. In\nparticular, geothermal power can provide low-cost\nbase load generation, facilitating economic\n\nactivity and development. It would also reduce\nthe current reliance on hydropower thereby\nimproving climate resilience.\n\nAs part of the NCCAP implementation, the Kenya\nhas\nalready\ndeveloped\na\nNAMA\nfor\nthe\nacceleration of geothermal development in Kenya.\nThis NAMA has been posted in the NAMA registry.\n\nEnergy Demand\n\nEnergy demand includes the final use of electricity\nand other sources of energy, such as biomass\ncombustion. At present, roughly 25 per cent of the\npopulation is connected to the electricity grid.\nAbout 60 per cent of electricity is consumed by\nthe commercial and industrial sectors, while\napproximately 25 per cent is used by households.\nDirect fuel combustion of biomass from wood\nsources, such as fuelwood and charcoal, is the\ndominant fuel source in Kenya, accounting for\nalmost 70 per cent of primary, non-electricity,\nnon-transport energy demand. This has placed the\nforests under pressure and has led to widespread\nscarcity of biomass. Direct fuel use in the\nindustrial and commercial sectors is relatively low.\nMoreover, the energy sector may be an important\ntransition point. The exploitation of indigenous\ncoal resources is beginning and domestic oil\nresources were discovered in early 2012.\n\nElectricity\ndemand,\nparticularly\nhousehold\ndemand, is expected to rise sharply with\ncontinued economic development and a growing\nshare of the population gaining access to\nelectricity. Even when using a conservative\napproach to estimate future energy demand,\nenergy-related GHG emissions are expected to\nincrease from 8 MtCO2e in 2010 to 50 MtCO2e in\n2030.\n\nEight low carbon development options were\nanalysed in the energy demand sector (Figure 58).\nImproved cookstoves that reduce the volume of\nbiomass required for cooking have the largest\n\n174\n\npotential for GHG emission reductions, 5.6 Mt\nCO2e a year in 2030. Replacing kerosene lamps\nwith renewable lighting technologies, using\nliquefied petroleum gas (LPG) instead of fuelwood\nfor cooking, and cogeneration of heat and power\nin agriculture were also found to have significant\nabatement potentials of over 1.5 MtCO2e a year in\n2030. The opportunities for promoting energy\nefficiency are captured under energy efficiency\nacross\nindustry,\nenergy\nefficient\nelectrical\nappliances and energy efficient light bulbs.\n\nSustainable development benefits associated with\nthe use of improved fuelwood or charcoal-based\nand LPG-based cookstoves include significant\nhealth benefits as a result of reduced indoor air\npollution. Health benefits are also expected with\nthe\nreplacement\nof\nkerosene\nlamps\nwith\ndistributed renewable energy (such as solar)\nlanterns. These technologies can also bring cost\nsavings to consumers, depending on the price of\nalternatives. Improved cookstoves and the use of\nLPG for cooking contribute to increased climate\nresilience as they lower fuelwood demand and\nreduce pressure on forests.\n\nFigure 58: Low carbon development wedge for energy demand\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nCogeneration in Agriculture\nCement Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\nIndustrial Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\nEnergy Efficient Light Bulbs\nSolar Thermal Water Heating\nRenewable Lamps\nLPG Stove Substitution\nImproved Cookstoves\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n\n175\n\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nImproved Cookstoves\n1.49\n2.35\n3.30\n5.22\nLPG Stove Substitution\n0.45\n0.71\n0.99\n1.30\nRenewable Lamps\n0.46\n0.70\n1.02\n1.51\nSolar Thermal Water Heating\n0.00\n0.02\n0.06\n0.14\nEnergy Efficient Light Bulbs\n0.01\n0.12\n0.39\n1.00\nIndustrial Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\n0.16\n0.48\n0.77\n1.15\nCement Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\n0.05\n0.07\n0.17\n0.21\nCogeneration in Agriculture\n0.13\n0.72\n1.23\n1.64\n\nElectricity Generation\n\nFigure 59: Low carbon development wedge for electricity supply\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nClean Coal (USC)\nLandfill gas generation\nSolar PV -distributed gridconnected\nHydro generation expansion\nWind generation expansion\nWind generation baseline\nGeothermal generation\nexpansion\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n\n176\n\n201\n5\n202\n0\n202\n5\n2030\nGeothermal generation\nexpansion\n0.00\n1.01\n6.37\n14.07\nWind generation baseline\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nWind generation expansion\n0.00\n0.20\n0.33\n1.36\nHydro generation expansion\n0.25\n0.42\n0.76\n1.10\nSolar PV - distributed gridconnected\n0.00\n0.11\n0.29\n0.65\nLandfill gas generation\n0.02\n0.14\n0.21\n0.34\nClean Coal (USC)\n0.00\n0.36\n0.65\n1.11\n\nNote: The methodological approach for the\nelectricity sector analysis deviates from a\ntraditional analysis of climate mitigation options.\nUsually, mitigation options are assumed to replace\na business as usual alternative or reference mix\n(Figure 59). However, for this analysis, the\nambitious electricity expansion plans needed to\nsatisfy Vision 2030 were assumed to be supply\nconstrained in the absence of external support.\nInternational climate finance for low-carbon\ndevelopment opportunities provides the funding\nfor additional capacity expansion that would not\nbe installed in the reference case.\n\nTransportation\n\nKenya’s transport sector is dominated by road\ntransport. The total vehicle population (excluding\nmotorcycles) is estimated to have doubled from\n600,000 vehicles in 2000 to 1,200,000 vehicles in\n2010. Public transport is relatively underdeveloped and is dominated by minibuses\n(matatus). The vast majority of freight transport,\nincluding transit freight headed to other countries,\nis served by trucks. At the same time, increasing\nurbanisation and the growth of major cities have\nput pressure on urban transport systems and\ninfrastructure. In Nairobi and other major cities,\nsevere traffic congestion, especially during the\nextended peak hours, contributes to local air\npollution and leads to significant economic losses\nin time and fuel. That said, the majority of\nindividual trips in cities are still by foot because\npublic transport services are comparatively\nexpensive and private cars are out of the financial\nreach of the majority of Kenyans.\n\nWith the sector experiencing strong growth, GHG\nemissions from transport are projected to grow\nsignificantly from 7 MtCO2e in 2010 to almost 20\nMtCO2e in 2030 (Figure 60). Improved traffic\nconditions and access to modern transport\nservices are required, along with increased\nefficiency\nthrough\nimproved\ntechnologies,\nalternative (including non-motorised) modes of\ntransport and fuel substitution.\n\nSeven low carbon development options were\nanalysed for the transport sector (Figure 5.4). The\noption with the largest mitigation potential is the\ndevelopment of an extensive mass transit system\nfor greater Nairobi in the form of bus rapid transit\n(BRT) corridors, complemented by light rail transit\n(LRT) in very high thorough fare corridors. This\n\n177\n\npublic transport system has an abatement\npotential of approximately 2.8 MtCO2e a year in\ntotal. The second largest mitigation potential is\nthe introduction of biodiesel, with a 10 per cent\nblend\nrequirement\nhaving\na\npotential\nof\napproximately 1.2 MtCO2e a year in 2030. The\nabatement potentials for the other low-carbon\ndevelopment options vary between 0.5 and 0.8\nMtCO2e a year in 2030.\n\nAccording to the Nairobi County Government, the\nBRT system implementation programme has been\nstarted in early 2015. A BRT system NAMA is also\nunderway as part of the implementation of the\nNCCAP.\nIn\naddition,\nKenya\nhas\nalready\ncommissioned the construction of a standard\ngauge railway from the Port of Mombasa all the\nway to the City of Kisumu. This will facilitate high\nspeed train transport and is expected to shift a\nsignificant passenger and freight transport from\nroad to rail.\n\nIntroducing\nlarge-scale\nbus\nrapid\ntransit\n(potentially complemented with some light rail\ntransit) has significant associated benefits in terms\nof reduced traffic congestion, improved local air\nquality and improved road safety. These options\nare in line with the priorities of the Government of\nKenya, which has started to secure funding for\nthese actions. A shift of freight transport from\nroad to rail through modernising and extending\nthe existing rail network would facilitate regional\ntrade, as well as improve traffic safety and road\ninfrastructure lifetimes. While the use of biofuels\nwould lower GHG emissions and the need for\nfossil fuel imports, large-scale production of\nbiofuels could compete for land with food\nproduction if poorly planned; any move towards\ncommercial growing of biofuel crops should be\npursued in a well-regulated manner.\n\nFigure 60: Low carbon development wedge for transportation\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nFreight from Road to Rail\nLRT Nairobi\nBRT Nairobi\nBioethanol\nBiodiesel\nImproved Heavy-Duty Vehicle\nStock Efficiency\nImproved Passenger Vehicle\nStock Efficiency\n\n178\n\nIndustrial Processes\n\nThe industrial sector is relatively small in Kenya,\nboth in terms of its share of GDP and contribution\nto total GHG emissions (in terms of process\nemissions). 95 per cent of industrial process\nemissions in Kenya are created by two industries:\ncement manufacturing (1.9 MtCO2e in 2010) and\ncharcoal manufacturing (0.8 MtCO2e in 2010). The\nfigures for charcoal production assume that the\nfeedstock used is completely carbon neutral. If 35\nper cent unsustainable biomass usage is assumed,\nemissions from charcoal production increase to\n4.3 MtCO2e.\n\nIn the reference scenario, emissions from charcoal\nproduction are projected to remain relatively\nstable, while emissions from cement production\nincrease to 4.4 MtCO2e in 2030. Process emissions\nfrom cement manufacturing can be reduced by\nreplacing clinker in the cement mix with\nalternative materials. Although some Kenyan\ncement companies are already implementing this\napproach to varying degrees, this was not\nconsidered in this low carbon analysis. The most\nsignificant low carbon development opportunity is\nthe introduction of more efficient kilns for\ncharcoal production, with an abatement potential\nof 1.6 MtCO2e per year in 2030 (see Figure 61).\nSustainable development benefits include reduced\nfuelwood demand leading to lower levels of\ndeforestation.\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nImproved Passenger Vehicle Stock\nEfficiency\n0.10\n0.22\n0.42\n0.64\nImproved Heavy-Duty Vehicle Stock\nEfficiency\n0.03\n0.11\n0.55\n0.84\nBiodiesel\n0.10\n0.65\n0.88\n1.21\nBioethanol\n0.23\n0.30\n0.40\n0.55\nBRT Nairobi\n0.82\n1.64\n1.98\n2.28\nLRT Nairobi\n0.21\n0.41\n0.50\n0.57\nFreight from Road to Rail\n0.05\n0.18\n0.40\n0.83\n\n179\n\nFigure 61: Low carbon development wedge for industrial processes\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nImproved Charcoal Production\nSystem\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nImproved Charcoal Production\nSystem\n0.26\n0.69\n1.03\n1.56\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture is the largest source of GHG emissions;\nit was responsible for more than one-third of\nKenya’s total emissions in 2010. Agricultural\nemissions are likely to increase from 30 MtCO2e in\n2010 to 35 MtCO2e in 2030 (Figure 61), largely\ndriven by livestock methane emissions and land\nuse change , which account for 90 per cent of\nagriculture emissions and about 30 per cent of\noverall national emissions. The sector also plays\nan important role in sequestering carbon in soil\nand trees on farms.\n\nAgricultural low carbon development options have\nthe potential to abate in the order of 6 MtCO2e\nper year in 2030 (Figure 62). The most significant\nreduction can be achieved through agroforestry,\nwhich has an abatement potential of 4 MtCO2e\n\n180\n\nper year in 2030. Other low carbon development\noptions include conservation tillage and limiting\nthe\nuse\nof\nfire\nin\nrange\nand\ncropland\nmanagement, with abatement potentials of over\n1.1 and 1.2 MtCO2e per year in 2030, respectively.\nThese three options are elements of a climatesmart agriculture approach, and a framework to\nencourage investment in climate-smart agriculture\nwill be an important action.\n\nLow\ncarbon\ndevelopment\nactions\nin\nthe\nagricultural sector have important sustainable\ndevelopment\nbenefits,\nincluding\nimproved\nretention of water and nutrients in the soil, and\nreduced soil erosion. These actions increase soil\nfertility and crop yields, improving food security\nand the livelihoods of farmers. Such efforts are\nimportant in arid and semi-arid lands where\nclimate conditions are expected to become more\nextreme. Efforts to increase agroforestry will help\nmeet Kenya’s goal of increasing tree cover on\nfarmland to 10 per cent as a means to preserving\nand maintaining the environment and combating\nclimate change.\n\nImportant actions related to the livestock sector\ninclude manure management through biogas\npromotion, and rangeland pasture rehabilitation,\nmanagement and conservation. In addition,\nactions to help farmers and pastoralists adapt to\nclimate change, discussed in Adaptation chapter\nof this Second National Communication , should\nbe undertaken in a manner that is as low-carbon\nas possible, complemented by awareness raising\nand education.\n\nFigure 62: Low carbon development wedge for agriculture\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nLimiting use of Fire in\nRange and Cropland\nManagement\nAgroforestry\nConservation Tillage\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\n181\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nConservation Tillage\n0.11\n0.65\n1.09\n1.09\nAgroforestry\n0.28\n1.66\n3.05\n4.16\nLimiting use of Fire in Range and Cropland\nManagement\n0.24\n0.26\n0.27\n0.29\n\nLULUCF\n\nForestry and other land use related emissions\naccounted for 23 MtCO2e in 2010, or about 32 per\ncent of national emissions. Emissions primarily\noriginate from deforestation, where forests are\ncleared for fuelwood and charcoal production or\nto create agricultural land. The Government of\nKenya is working to increase tree cover to 10 per\ncent of total land area – a goal stated in the 2010\nconstitution.\n\nEmissions are expected to increase to 26 MtCO2e\nin 2015 and then decline to 22 MtCO2e by 2030,\n(See Figure 63). Reduced deforestation and\nincreases in the carbon stock of trees contribute\nto the decline in emissions. On-going GoK REDD+\nactivities are taken into account in the reference\ncase. Low carbon development actions in the\nforestry sector have the potential to abate an\nadditional 40 MtCO2e per year in 2030 compared\nto the baseline (Figure 63).\n\nThe most significant abatement potential can be\nachieved through restoration of forests on\ndegraded lands. Abatement potential of 32.6\nMtCO2e per year by 2030 is likely through\nconservation and sustainable forest management\ninterventions. Restoration of degraded forests has\nan abatement potential of 6.1 MtCO2e per year by\n2030, and reducing deforestation and forest\ndegradation potentially can abate 1.6 MtCO2e per\nyear by 2030.\n\nKenya’s forest resources provide important\nenvironmental and ecosystem services, and\ncontribute to economic development, rural\nlivelihoods,\nwater\navailability\nand\nclimate\nresilience (adaptation benefits). Maintenance of\nand increased forest cover in water catchments is\ncritical for sustaining water availability and the\ngeneration of hydropower.\n\n182\n\nFigure 63: Low carbon development wedge for the LULUCF\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nReducing Deforestation\nand Forest Degradation\nReforestation of\nDegraded Forests\nRestoration of Forests\non Degraded Lands\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nRestoration of Forests on Degraded Lands\n2.17\n13.03\n23.88\n32.56\nReforestation of Degraded Forests\n0.40\n2.42\n4.44\n6.06\nReducing Deforestation and Forest\nDegradation\n0.13\n0.79\n1.44\n1.57\n\nWaste\n\nLandfills and sewage treatment plants generate\nGHG emissions through the production of\nmethane.

The summarised\ninvestment costs for implementing the six low\ncarbon options to 2030 are shown on Table 66.\nThe details of these costs are provided in the\nNCCAP.\n\nThe methodology used for calculating these\nprimary costs is detailed in the Low Carbon –\nMitigation Annexes of the NCCAP. It is estimated\nthat KSh839 – 1,110 billion of these investment\ncosts would have to be borne by the public sector,\nwith the remaining costs covered by private sector\nand household investments. Kenya sees clear\npotential to make effective use of bilateral and\nmultilateral funding, as well as international\nclimate finance mechanisms – such as the Green\nClimate Fund and emerging NAMAs and REDD+\nmechanisms– in moving forward with the\nimplementation of these actions.\n\nTable 57: Projected investment costs for priority mitigation actions\n\n185\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\n\n186\n\nSUMMARY OF MITIGATION ACTIONS\n\nBased\non\nthe\ncomprehensive\nbottom-up\nassessment in the NCCAP and the update\nconducted during the preparation of the Second\nNational Communication, six proposed priority\nareas for low carbon development and proposals\nfor their implementation are described in Table 67\nbelow. These six priority areas cover about threequarters of total abatement potentials found in\nthis study. Their full deployment would almost\nhalve GHG emissions by 2030 compared to the\nreference\ncase\nscenario\n(cross-sectoral\ninteractions not taken into account). Investment\ncosts would vary, but significant reductions can be\nobtained at marginal costs of less than US$15 per\ntonne of carbon. Some of these options also\ndeliver fuel savings, which may result in overall\nsocial cost savings relative to high emitting\noptions.\n\nSignificant investments will be required and a\nseries of barriers will need to be addressed before\nthe low-carbon opportunities can be realised.\nImplementing the six priority low carbon actions\nwould require investments of KSh 1,371 – 1,773\nbillion (USD 16.12 – 20.84 billion) until 2030\n(equivalent to a Net Present Value of KSh600 –\n770 billion at a real discount rate of 10 per cent).\nOut of these investment costs, it is estimated that\nKSh839 – 1,110 billion would have to be borne by\nthe public sector, with the remaining costs\ncovered\nby\nprivate\nsector\nand\nhousehold\ninvestments. A large challenge is financing the\nhigher upfront costs of low carbon investments.\nKenya sees clear potential to make effective use of\nbilateral and multilateral funding, as well as\ninternational climate finance mechanisms – such\nas the Green Climate Fund and the international\nsupport likely to be mobilised to support the\nemerging NAMA and REDD+ mechanisms– in\nmoving forward on the Action Plan, in addition to\nsystematic domestic support.\n\n187\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\nTable 58: Suggested priority low-carbon development opportunities up to 2030\n\n188\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\nTable 59: Suggested priority low-carbon development opportunities up to 2030 (continued)\n\n189\n\nTable 60: Summary of Mitigation Actions\nNumber\nAction\nEstimated Cost\nKSh to 2030\nMITI-1\n\nRestoration of Forests on Degraded Lands -Undertake a programme of work\nto restore forests on 960,000 hectares up to 2030 including: inter alia\ndryland forest restoration activities; awareness raising, consultation and\ndemonstration; capacity building; development, testing and application of\ncompensation and benefits-sharing mechanisms; measuring, monitoring and\nti\nd\nh\n186-290billion\n\nMITI-2\n\nGeothermal - Develop an additional 2,275 MW of geothermal capacity by\n2030 through a support programme aimed at encouraging private sector\ninvestment.

The report is structured as follows:\nSection 2 covers the steps taken to integrate\nclimate change into relevant social, economic\nand environmental policies and the relevant\nnational, social, economic and environmental\npolicies and activities geared towards the\nimplementation of the Convention.\n\nSection 3 briefly describes the activities related\nto technology transfer, including the country’s\ntechnology needs assessments. It covers the\npriority needs on transfer of know-how and\naccess to ESTs, including measures relating to\nenhancing the enabling environment for their\ndevelopment. Also illustrated are the country’s\ncurrent and planned technology transfer\nmechanisms, development and enhancement of\nthe country’s endogenous capacities and knowhow, especially as relates to the grid connected\nenergy.\n\nSection 4 provides a description of the country’s\nclimate change observation and research\nsystems, including research to adapt to and\nmitigate climate change and the country’s\nparticipation in, and contribution to, activities\nand programmes, as appropriate to its national,\nregional and global research networks.\n\nSection 5 provides information on climate\nchange\neducation,\ntraining\nand\npublic\nawareness in the country. This includes plans of\nthe country in strengthening the mainstreaming\nof climate change in education, training and\npublic awareness.\n\nSection 6 provides a brief description of the\ncountry status on capacity-building activities at\nthe national, regional and sub-regional levels.\nThis\nincludes\nplans\nof\nthe\ncountry\nin\nstrengthening the coordination, dissemination\nand sustainability of capacity-building activities\nin the country. The section includes information\non Kenya’s efforts to promote information\nsharing.\n\nSection 7 describes the country’s constraints\nand gaps, and related financial, technical and\ncapacity\nneeds.\nAs\nassociated\nwith\nthe\nimplementation of activities, measures and\nprogrammes envisaged under the Convention,\nand with the preparation and improvement of\nnational communications on a continuous basis.\n\nSTEPS TAKEN TO INTEGRATE CLIMATE\nCHANGE INTO RELEVANT POLICIES\n\nKenya is highly vulnerable to climate change\nand therefore faces challenges in economic\ndevelopment. Kenya Vision 2030 – the longterm development blueprint for the country –\naims to transform Kenya into “a newly\nindustrialising,\nmiddle-income\ncountry\nproviding a high quality of life to all its citizens\nin a clean and secure environment.” As Kenya\nstrives to achieve middle income status,\nnational development is challenged by the\nenvironmental\nconsequences\nof\neconomic\ngrowth and the presence of climate change. In\nrecognition of the serious threats posed by\nclimate change and in adhering towards the\nimplementation\nof\nthe\nConvention\nthe\nGovernment as discussed below has taken and\ncontinues to take bold measures to secure the\ncountry’s development against the risks and\nimpacts of climate change.\n\n194\n\nKEY POLICIES CONTAINING MEASURES TO\nMAINSTREAM CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nIn recognition of the serious threats posed by\nclimate change and the need to implement the\nConvention, the Government has taken and\ncontinues to take measures to secure the\ncountry’s development against the risks and\nimpacts of climate change. The main strategies\nand policies, as well as other relevant sectoral\npolicies are described below.\n\nKenya’s National Climate Change Response\nStrategy (NCCRS)\n\nIn 2010, the Government launched a National\nClimate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS). The\nStrategy was the country’s first national policy\ndocument to fully recognize the reality of\nclimate change. It provided evidence of climate\nimpacts on different economic sectors and\nproposed adaptation and mitigation strategies.\nIt presented a series of observed climatic trends\nin Kenya, including a general warming over land\nlocations. The Strategy not only improved\nunderstanding of the global climate change\nregime and the impacts of climate change in the\ncountry but also been guiding policy decisions\nsince its launch.\n\nKenya’s National Climate Change Action\nPlan (NCCAP)\n\nA comprehensive NCCAP was launched in 2013.\nIt takes adaptation and mitigation efforts to the\nnext stage of implementation and guides action\nto respond to climate change challenges. The\nNCCAP\nencourages\npeople\ncentred\ndevelopment, ensuring that climate change\nactions\nsupport\nachievement\nof\nKenya’s\ndevelopment goals and Vision 2030.\n\nThe NCCAP was developed, through an\nextensive\nconsultative\nprocess,\nand\nhas\nreceived support from a wide range of\nstakeholders including development partners.\n\nEight subcomponents form the core of the\nNCCAP and represent long-term and integrated\nstrategies for achieving key climate change\ngoals. The eight subcomponents are;\n\nSubcomponent 1: Long-term National Low\nCarbon\nClimate\nResilient\nDevelopment\nPathway facilitates mainstreaming of climate\nchange aspects in the country’s long term\ndevelopment planning and budgeting. The\nMinistry responsible for planning has used this\nas a platform to integrate climate change into\nthe Vision 2030 Medium Term Plan (20132017).\nSubcomponent\n2:\nEnabling",

    "extracted_text": "Institutional Framework\nKenya has clear coordination structures for\nclimate change matters under the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Climate Change and Forestry,\nwith the overarching policy, coordination\nand oversight of climate change affairs\nbeing performed by the National Climate\nChange Council, chaired by the President.\nThe Act establishes the Climate Change\nDirectorate (CCD) as the lead government\nagency responsible for coordinating climate\nchange plans and actions and related\nmeasurement, monitoring, and reporting.\nTo ensure coherence, the Act designates the\nCCD as the Secretariat for the NCCC with the\nresponsibility of coordinating the technical\naspects of the implementation of climate\nchange functions. Such functions, include:\nproviding analytical support and technical\nassistance on climate change and coordinating\nthe implementation of and reporting on the\nNCCAPs as well as capacity building support\nat the two levels of government – National\nand County Governments.\nThe Act obligates, at the sectoral level, state\ndepartments and agencies to establish Climate\nChange Units (CCUs) to integrate NCCAP actions\ninto their strategies and implementation plans.\nThe Directorate performs coordination work\nthrough the Climate Change Units established\nin all ministries, counties, departments and\nagencies. At the sub-national level, county\ngovernments are required to designate a\nCounty Executive Committee member to\ncoordinate climate change in each county\nthrough the establishment of a Climate Change\nUnit (CCU).\nThe Act designates the National Environment\nManagement Authority (NEMA) as the body\nresponsible for enforcing climate change\nduties for state and non-state actors. With\nthe amendment of the Act in 2023, NEMA was\nalso appointed as the Designated National\nAuthority (DNA) for market mechanisms and\nother mechanisms stemming from Article 6\nof the Paris Agreement.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n6\n7\n\n2\nThe NDC\nDevelopment Process\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n9\n\nThe process for preparing Kenya’s New\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC 20312035) was characterised by significant time\nconstraints and the need to respond to new\ngovernment priorities, including strengthening\nimplementation of the NDC and boosting\nprivate sector interest. The New NDC has\nbeen developed in the context of the country’s\nnational circumstances and development\nagenda with a strong focus on gender equity.\nIt builds on existing national policies and legal\nframeworks, including the Constitution of\nKenya (2010), the Climate Change Act (2016),\nthe First Nationally Determined Contribution\n(2021 – 2030), the Third National Climate\nChange Action Plan (2023 – 2027), the National\nAdaptation Plan (2015 – 2030) and the Draft\nKenya’s Long-Term Low-Emission Development\nStrategy (LT-LEDS).\nThe Climate Change Directorate of the Ministry\nof Environment, Climate Change and Forestry,\nand in consultation with relevant departments\nand agencies across the government,\nconducted a detailed analysis to underpin the\nadaptation and mitigation targets upto 2035,\nreviewing a range of pathways for each sector\nof the economy that contributes significant\ngreenhouse gas emissions in line with the\nnational circumstances, the latest National\nInventory Report and the IPCC guidelines.\nThis was enriched by a comprehensive gender\nanalysis. Technology availability, potential cost\nimplications were considered, as well as the\nrole of enabling infrastructure. Incentives, and\nsupport for innovation are to be considered at\nthe detailed action design phase. Additionally,\nthere were youth specific consultation meetings\nto ensure intergenerational equity and inclusion\nof youth in the development of the NDC.\nIn order to ensure alignment and coherence\nwith Kenya’s national circumstances, sustainable\ndevelopment agenda, government objectives\nand plans, the process started with a review\nof the relevant national plans, policies and\nlegislation at both national and sector levels.\nRelevant data was collected from different\nsectors and analysed to understand and\nupdate both climate impacts and the extent\nof implementation of climate actions to date,\nand to identify potential NDC priority actions.\nVarious adaptation and mitigation actions\nwere proposed based on inputs from both\ngovernment and other stakeholders. The\nactions were then analysed to determine\npotential impacts and to identify potential\npriority actions for further analysis and\nconsultations. Comprehensive gender analysis\ninformed the revision throughout the process.\nThe NDC development process was\ngovernment-led through the Climate Change\nDirectorate of the Ministry of Environment,\nClimate Change and Forestry. The process,\nwhich entailed planning, review of official\ngovernment documents, public consultations\nand engagements, together with approvals\nat different stages, was not only consultative\nand inclusive, but was also based on clear\ncommunication using the best available\nnational data. A key objective of the process\napplied was to facilitate stakeholder ownership\nand effective implementation using both topdown and bottom-up approaches.\nDuring the NDC 2031-2035 development\nprocess, the consultants worked closely\nwith the stakeholders in an inclusive and\nconsultative manner to update and enhance\nKenya’s contributions. Stakeholders were\nidentified from various national and county\ngovernment sectors, civil society, academia\nand private sector. To ensure inputs went\nbeyond technical analysis and considered\nother aspects of Kenyan life, a range of other\nstakeholders representing the distinctive\nperspectives of the Kenyan people were\nconsulted, including the private sector, the\nlabour movement, environmental justice\norganisations, youth organisations, subnational (county) governments, and others.\nUsing both individual and group approaches,\nconsultations were conducted at different\nstages of the process as physical or virtual\nworkshops.\nIn line with paragraph 22-35 of decision 1/\nCP.21 and Decision 4/CMA .1 and its annex,\nthe process was structured to support\nenhancement of mitigation, adaptation and\ntransparent communication, together with\nthe alignment of the NDC with the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). The data and\ninformation collected from the document\nreview and various consultations were used for\nthe simultaneous determination and design\nof the New NDC, including mitigation and\nadaptation enhancements. The enhancements\nhave not only targeted mitigation ambitions\nof the NDC, but also the strengthening of\nthe NDC’s implementation. The adaptation\ncomponent of the NDC draws from the National\nAdaptation Plan (NAP). 3\nThe NDC Ambition\nThis bold\nstrategy\npositions Kenya\nas a regional\nleader in\ngreen energy\ntransition.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n10\n11\n\nKenya’s New NDC includes both mitigation\nand adaptation components based on\nher national circumstances, noting that\nclimate action must lead to socio-economic\ndevelopment. Kenya aims to achieve her longterm development objectives through a low\ncarbon, climate resilient pathway in inclusive\nand equitable ways that foster just transition\nfor sustainability. The mitigation and adaptation\ninterventions outlined in this NDC are designed\nto maximize co-benefits (between mitigation\nand adaptation), enhancing resilience in Kenya’s\nclimate-vulnerable socio-economic sectors\nwhile contributing to emission reductions.\nThese measures address projected climate\nimpacts for 2031–2035 and integrate genderresponsive approaches to account for differing\nvulnerabilities across population groups. Kenya\nwill implement its NDC through the National\nClimate Change Action Plans (NCCAPs) which\nwill be periodically reviewed.\nCognisant that there exists gender\ndifferentiated vulnerabilities due to climate\nchange impacts, and that men and women\ncontribute differently to the same due to their\nrespective gender roles, Kenya will implement\nthe outlined adaptation and mitigation priorities\nin a gender responsive manner in order to\npromote inclusivity in climate action. To do this,\nKenya will advance meaningful participation\nand representation of vulnerable populations\nin climate action through capacity building and\nskills development, technology and innovations\nas well as targeted inclusive access to climate\nfinance, among other initiatives.\n3.1\nMitigation\nKenya’s ambitious mitigation target is economywide, designed to lead to emission reductions\nacross all sectors without compromising socioeconomic development. Priority mitigation\nactions will be achieved through policies,\nprograms and measures, with additional\nemission reductions being realized through\ncarbon markets, while promoting sustainable\ndevelopment and environmental integrity.\nKenya will develop and periodically review\nher whitelist for 2031 to 2035 to support her\nparticipation in carbon markets and other\nmechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris\nAgreement. Additionally, Kenya will set annual\ntargets for the NDC implementation period to\nguide her participation in these mechanisms.\nAs part of the mitigation approach, Kenya will\nleverage carbon markets to attract investment\nand enhance its mitigation ambition.

effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of\npolicies, projects and programmes to ensure\naccountability, and inform decision-making.\nMonitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)\nsystem is crucial for tracking Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (NDCs) as it ensures\ntransparency, accountability, and credibility in\nclimate commitments.\nKenya continues to strengthen its MRV\nsystem, including an integrated MRV tool for\nmonitoring and reporting both mitigation and\nadaptation actions, together with their results.\nTo facilitate tracking of climate change actions\nand reporting, Kenya will review and develop\nM&E Framework to align with this NDC. The\nMRV system is designed to be interoperable\nwith existing systems that includes National\nIntegrated Monitoring and Evaluation System\n(NIMES) and County Integrated Monitoring\nand Evaluation System (CIMES).\nIn line with the Climate Change Act, Monitoring,\nReporting and Verification of the NDC will be\ncoordinated by the Climate Change Directorate.\nDuring the NDC implementation period\n(2031-2035) Climate Change Directorate will\ncoordinate State and Non-State actors in\ndeveloping annual, mid-term and end-term\nreports. The reports generated through the\nIntegrated MRV System will provide input\nfor both national and international reporting\nobligations and help to foster global progress\ntowards the shared goal of combating climate\nchange and securing a sustainable future.\n5\nFairness in the\nAmbition\nThe sequenced\nripple effect of\naffordable and\nreliable energy\nis poised to\ndrive the NDC\nmitigation goal.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n26\n27\n\nKenya’s 2031 – 2035 NDC represents a level\nof sacrifice which is far beyond Kenya’s fair\nshare of ambition towards the achievement of\nglobal climate goals. Kenya’s contribution to\nboth current and historical global emissions\nis negligible (less than 0.1%). By October\n2021, it was estimated that cumulative\nglobal anthropogenic emissions since 1850\nwas around 2,500Gt CO2, specifically from\ndeveloped countries, leaving less than\n500Gt CO2 of remaining carbon budget\nto stay below 1.5°C of warming. Like most\nof Africa, Kenya has historically been a net\nsink, till late 1980s when negligible emissions\ncould be estimated, mainly due to population\ngrowth and pursuit of basic development.\nKenya’s per-capita emissions were less than\n2.09tCO2eq compared to the global average\nof 6.76tCO2eq in 2022.\nKenya’s emission sources are mainly from the\n“hard to abate” sectors, creating the dilemma\nof choosing between the vital climate action\nand the needed socio-economic development.\nKenya is also endowed with fossil fuel natural\nresources while still faced with developmental\nchallenges such as high poverty rates which\ndisproportionately affect the vulnerable\ngender groups, high rates of unemployment\nespecially among the youthful population, and\na huge debt burden. Kenya has demonstrated\nleadership in climate action, by sacrificing (for\nglobal good) the exploitation of brown natural\nresources that could quickly jumpstart the\nGDP, address the debt burden and trigger\neconomic growth, create jobs and trigger\nrapid development, just like other peers whose\neconomies have been transformed due to\ntheir exploitation of fossil fuels.\nThis NDC builds on the Updated First NDC\n(2020) in which Kenya undertook to make a\ncontribution that targeted a high proportion\nof its mitigation potential and was dependent\non the level of international support available.\nThe contributions set through this New NDC\nreflects an enhancement of ambition in the\nfollowing areas:\n\tꞏ\nAn increase in emission reduction\ntargets from 32% in the Updated First\nNDC to 35% in this New NDC.\n\tꞏ\nEnhanced domestic contribution from\n13% to 19% of the NDC cost.\nThis represents a high level of fairness\nand ambition in light of Kenya’s national\ncircumstances. 6\nPlanning Process\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n28\n29\n\nKenya’s planning process on mitigation and\nadaptation is based on her development\nplanning processes. It is worth noting that\nby 1st January, 2031, the Kenya Vision 2030\nimplementation period will have ended, and\na New Long Term Development Vision will\nbe commencing. This NDC will be updated\nbefore the implementation period to comply\nwith the Medium Term Plans (MTPs) of the\nnew national long term vision, which will also\nbe in sync with NCCAP IV and V as well as the\nnew version of the National Adaptation Plan.\nThe NCCAPs are reviewed every five years\nto inform the Medium Term Planning of the\nNational Long Term Vision.\nMitigation and adaptation actions are\nimplemented across the various sectors and\nat national and county government levels. The\nMinistry of Environment, Clim)ate Change and\nForestry coordinates the country’s climate\nchange affairs through the National Climate\nChange Council and the Climate Change\nDirectorate.\n7\nMeans of\nImplementation\nKenya’s NDC\n(2031–2035)\nadopts a\ncoherent\nstrategy of\nwhole-ofgovernment,\nwhole-of-society\napproach to\nclimate action.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n30\n31\n\nKenya’s contribution will be implemented\nthrough both domestic and international\nsupport. It is estimated that USD 56 Billion\nis required for mitigation and adaptation\nactions across sectors from 1st January 2031\ntill 31st December 2035. Of the estimated total\nbudget, 40% (USD 22.5 Billion) is required\nfor mitigation efforts that will also catalyse\nKenya’s rapid socio-economic development\nin a low carbon climate resilient development\npathway. Approximately 32% (USD 17.7 Billion)\nof the budget will support adaptation activities\ndesigned to make Kenya resilient to the\nincreasing magnitude and frequency of the\nclimate change impacts. The remaining 28%\n(USD 15.8 Billion) comprises of projects\ndesigned to dually deliver mitigation and\nadaptation benefits. Subject to national\ncircumstances, Kenya will endeavour to mobilize\ndomestic resources to meet approximately\n19% (USD 10.5 Billion, at USD 2.1 Billion\nper year) of this budget. Approximately USD\n45.36 Billion (81%) will require international\nsupport. Since all loans have a repayment\nconsequence to the Kenyan taxpayer, Kenya\nwill consider climate finance support received\nin loan instruments as part of her domestic\ncontribution. Kenya will develop an elaborate\ninvestment plan for the actions outlined in\nthis NDC.\nIt is estimated\nthat USD\n56 Billion is\nrequired for\nmitigation and\nadaptation\nactions across\nsectors\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n32\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF KENYA\nMinistry of Environment,\nClimate Change and Forestry\nDesign and Layout by:",
