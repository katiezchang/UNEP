For example, evidence now shows\nthat climate change increased the intensity of rainfall in the\nshort rainy season in the Horn of Africa in 2023, leading to\nsevere flash flooding in eastern which caused more than\n300 deaths and displaced over a million people.\n\n▶\nThe three most significant climatic hazards in Kenya are\nanalysed in latest draft AdCom (2024) for the country and\nsummarised below, these include increasing temperatures,\nchanging rainfall patterns, and sea level rise along the coast.\n\n▶\nCurrent data shows that Kenya is ranked 145th out of 187\ncountries in the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative\n(ND-GAIN) index, which ranks countries on their level of\nvulnerability to climate change and readiness to implement\nadaptation solutions.\n\n▶\nKenya’s rapidly increasing population and subsequent\nmigration to urban areas has also been identified as a\nfactor that increases vulnerability to climate change; this\nis significantly attributable to low coping adaptive capacity\nas over 51 percent of the urban population in Kenya in\n2020 was considered poor and living in unplanned informal\nsettlements without basic infrastructure and services.\n\n▶\nOverall, across the country, evidence suggests that frequent\ncycles of floods and droughts have significant socio-economic\nimpacts; these often cause high economic costs as scarce\ngovernment resources are re-allocated to respond to climate\nemergencies.\n\n▶\nIn monetary terms, the socio-economic losses associated\nwith climate change in Kenya over the past decade were\nestimated to amount to between 3 percent and 5 percent\nof the country’s GDP per year.\nD. Implementation Progress\nThe government has made progress in implementing adaptation\nactions towards the target of a climate-resilient society by 2030.\nSome areas of progress have been highlighted below.\n\n▶\nThe government effectively coordinated more than Ksh. 70\nbillion drought response interventions during the 2021 –\n2023 drought. The government contributed KSh. 22 billion,\nwhile non-state actors contributed KSh. 48 billion.\n\n▶\nOver 3,000 water tanks, dams, boreholes, pans, or earth\ndams were constructed or installed for water harvesting\nand storage across ASAL counties with high drought risk.\n\n▶\nThe Asset Creation Programme constructed rainwater\nharvesting structures in 1,000 sites across 14 ASAL counties.\nThe government operationalized the National Drought\nEmergency Fund (NDEF) and gazetted and sensitized\nthe members of the County Drought and Food Security\nCommittees (CDFSC) for county-level coordination in the\n23 ASAL counties. So far, the Fund has received a total of\nKsh. 345 million in funding from the National Treasury for\ndifferent components.\n\n▶\nAs part of the plan to increase flood resilience, the government,\nthrough the Kenya Meteorology Department (KMD), has\nincreased the amount and timeliness of flood early warnings\nand weather forecasts during rain seasons.\n\n▶\nThe National Drought Management Authority (NDMA)\ndisbursed over KES 3.3 billion under the HSNP through more\nthan 100,000 households, out of which 60% of recipients\nwere women in arid counties.\n\n▶\nAround 200,000 actors in the agriculture sector are now\nharvesting and storing water for irrigation.\n\n▶\nThe area under irrigation in Kenya has increased by over\n5,000 Hectares.\n\n▶\nClose to 400,000 farmers have access to climate-oriented\ncrop insurance\n\n▶\nThe number of farmers accessing climate-oriented livestock\ninsurance increased marginally as new farmer households\ninsured over 90,000 cattle by the end of 2022.\n\n▶\nOver 55 hydrogeological surveys were undertaken across\nseveral counties in Kenya as efforts towards sustainable\ngroundwater abstraction.\n\n▶\nDe-siltation of existing dams, extending water pipelines,\nand protecting water catchment areas and sources such as\nsprings enhanced the availability of safe water and reduced\ndistances travelled to access water.\n\n▶\nThe annual ASALs water harvesting and storage capacity\nimproved by 1,130,000 M3 from the 38 water pans, 6\nsubsurface dams constructed, and 73 boreholes and shallow\nwells in 11 ASAL counties\n\n▶\nThe annual ASALs water harvesting and storage capacity\nimproved by 1,130,000 M3 from the 38 water pans, 6\nsubsurface dams constructed and 73 bore holes and\nshallow wells in 11 ASAL counties\n\n▶\nThe government has also supported close to 300,000 new\nhouseholds in Kenya to adopt diversified adaptive enterprises\nfor sustained livelihoods and nutrition security. Examples\nof such enterprises include indigenous poultry, dairy goats,\ndairy intensification, tissue culture in banana production,\nand pasture seeds, among others.\n| x Biennial Transparency Report\n\n▶\nThe Kenya Integrated Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Project\n(KIWASH, 2015-2020) enabled nearly 900,000 Kenyans across\nnine counties to gain access to improved water security,\nsanitation, and hygiene services and assisted households\nin gaining access to irrigation and nutrition services.\n\n▶\nTo increase water harvesting and water storage infrastructure,\nover 600 boreholes have been constructed to tap into\ngroundwater resources in response to increased water\nscarcity resulting mainly from drought in the most vulnerable\ncounties.\n\n▶\nIn the coast of Kenya, over 600 Ha of mangrove forests were\neither planted or rehabilitated to protect the coastline and\nsustain ecosystem services for the coastal communities;\nthis is key for their livelihood resilience and adaptation.\n\n▶\nThe World Agroforestry Centre established the Kenya\nRangelands Ecosystem Services Productivity Programme to\nimprove the livelihoods of communities and their landscapes\nby enhancing the productivity of ecosystem services provided\nby rangelands for food, feed, and human and wildlife security\nin Laikipia, Samburu, Isiolo, and Baringo.\n\n▶\nKenya Breweries developed a low-cost beer made from\nsorghum. This has created new market opportunities for\nthe brewer as well supported over 47,000 farmers from\nmarginal areas to transition from subsistence to sustainable\ncommercial farming.\nE. Support Needed and Received\n\n▶\nKenya requires USD 62 billion until 2030 to support the\nimplementation of NDC targets.\n\n▶\nKenya has received a total of about USD 508 Million in\nthis BTR period. This constitutes both on-budget and offbudget support.\n\n▶\nThe on-budget support accounts for 89% of the total sum\nwhich is USD 457 Million.\n\n▶\nOff-budget support amounted to USD 51 Million.\n\n▶\nUSD 53 Million was delivered as grants, USD 365 million\nwas in loans.\nBiennial Transparency Report xi |\n\nChapter One\n01\nNational Inventory Report of Anthropogenic\nEmissions by Sources and Removals by Sinks\nof Greenhouse Gases\n1.1.\tOverview\nKenya has developed a stand-alone inventory report that includes\na national inventory document and common reporting tables.\nThe inventory document has been annexed to the Biennial\nTransparency Report (BTR), while the common reporting tables\nhave been submitted electronically using the UNFCCC CRT tools.\nThe inventory report has been prepared in line with the modalities,\nprocedures, and guidelines for the enhanced transparency\nframework provided in the annex to decision 18/CMA.1.\nAccording to the estimations, Kenya’s total greenhouse gas\nemissions were equivalent to 113,366 GgCO2eq, including the\nLULUCF Sector in 2022. Total CO2 emissions for the year 2022\nare estimated to be 66,519.7 GgCO2eq without contribution\nfrom LULUCF. For details, please refer to the national inventory\ndocument.\n1.2. Description of GHG emissions and removals\n1.2.1. Overview of greenhouse gas inventory\nBackground information on Kenya’s greenhouse gas inventory\nKenya has developed a stand-alone GHG inventory document that\ncontains information on emissions and removals of GHGs. The\ninventory document has been developed in line with the provisions\nof the modalities, procedures and guidelines for the enhanced\ntransparency framework provided in the annex to decision 18/\nCMA.1. Therefore, this chapter provides only a summary of the\ninformation in the report.\nKenya’s emissions for the GHG inventory have been estimated in\nline with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for the National Greenhouse Gas\nInventories (2006 IPCC Guidelines), which were developed by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Kenya used\nthe IPCC software to estimate the emissions for all the sectors.\n1.2.2. Description of emission and removal trends for aggregated GHG\nemissions and removals\nKenya’s total greenhouse gas emissions were equivalent to\n113,366 GgCO2eq including the LULUCF Sector in 2022. The\ntotal greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 343 percent\nsince 1990 (Table 1.1). Total CO2 emissions for the year 2022 are\nestimated to be 66,519.7 GgCO2eq without contribution from\nLULUCF. Trends in total emissions for the time series 1990 to\n2022 are shown in figures 1.1 and 1.2. In general emission have\nbeen increasing since 1990 rising to 69,399.5 GgCO2eq in 2021\nwithout LULUCF and then dropping slightly in 2022.\nBiennial Transparency Report 1 |\n\nTable 1.1: Total National Emissions without and with LULUCF\nTotal National\nemissions (GgCO2eq)\nYear\nAnnual\ngrowth\nrate\n~% Change\n1990 - 2022\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2020\n2022\nWithout LULUCF\n25,593.70\n25,045.00\n40,886.20\n67,873.60\n66,519.70\n5%\n160%\nWith LULUCF\n25,593.70\n25,045.00\n55,861.10\n108,330.40\n113,366.00\n10%\n343%\n\nFigure 1.1: Kenya total greenhouse gas emissions trends 1990 – 2022 with the LULUCF sector\n\nFigure 1.2: Kenya total greenhouse gas emissions trends 1990–2022 without LULUCF\nEmission growth is primarily driven by Energy and AFOLU sectors\nwhich have remained net emitters, showing deforestation and\nforest degradation have been exceeding the reforestation rates\nthroughout the period and together with increased consumption of\nfossil fuels. Other drivers of emissions are; increased agricultural\nactivities, and demand for fossil fuels in the energy sector.\nOver the period 1990 to 2022, the average annual growth in overall\nemissions has been 4 percent per year including the LULUCF sector.\nGreenhouse gas emission contributions by sector and by type of\ngreenhouse gas are summarized in section 2.2 below.\n1.2.3.\nDescription of emission and removal trends by sector and by\ngas\nEmission trends by Source-Sector\nKenya is amongst developing nations in which Agriculture and\nLULUCF sectors dominates the share of its total greenhouse\ngas emissions. Tables 1.2 provides a summary of sectoral\ngreenhouse gas emissions results for all sectors, and figure 1.3\n| 2 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nshows Emissions trends by sectors without LULUCF, while figure\n1.4 shows emissions trends by sector including LULUCF.\nTable 1.2: Kenya’s sectoral greenhouse gas emissions Summary 1990-2022\nCategories\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2020\n2022\nAnnual\ngrowth\nrate\n~% Change\n1990 – 2022\n3A/C - Agriculture\n15,639.70\n13,732.70\n19,941.10\n40,211.60\n36,102.20\n4%\n131%\n1 - Energy\n7,018.60\n7,767.70\n15,185.00\n20,625.90\n21,503.20\n6%\n206%\n4 - Waste\n2,171.50\n2,953.30\n4,113.40\n5,009.30\n5,237.00\n4%\n141%\n2 - IPPU\n764\n591.2\n1,646.70\n2,026.90\n3,677.20\n12%\n381%\n3B - LULUCF\n -\n14,974.90\n40,456.80\n46,846.30\n20%\n653%\nFigure 1.3: GHG emission trend by sector in GgCO2eq, excluding LULUCF\nFigure 1.4: GHG emission trend by sector in GgCO2eq., including LULUCF\nThe LULUCF sector emitted 46,846.3 GgCO2eq in 2022 (41% of\nthe national emissions). The Agriculture sector was a net emitter\nin 2022 contributing approximately 36,102.2 GgCO2eq or 32% of\nthe national emissions. Thus AFOLU (combined agriculture, land\nuse change and forestry) is the largest contributor to the total\nemissions in Kenya having 73% share. (Tables 1.2 and figure 1.5).\nThe energy sector emitted 21,503.2 GgCO2eq., contributing 20\npercent of the total GHG emissions in 2022. The waste sector\nemitted 5,237.0 Gg CO2eq in 2022, which was 5 percent of the\ntotal GHG emission. The Industrial Processes and Product Use\nemitted 3,677.2 Gg CO2eq or about 3% of total GHG emissions.\n(Tables 1.2 and figure 1.5).\nThe LULUCF emissions grew at average rate of 20% per annum\nwhich is the highest annual rate by sector, followed by Industrial\nprocess emissions at an average rate of 12 % per year. The Energy\nemissions grew at an average rate of 6% per year between 1990\nand 2022. Waste process and Agriculture emissions grew much\nslower at an average rate of 4% per year. (Table 1.2).\nEmissions from the AFOLU sector have been increasing steadily\nsince 1990 to 2022 due steady demand for agricultural land,\ndeforestation activities and use of synthetic fertilizers, and\nincreasing number of livestock. IPPU Emissions have continued\nto grow primarily due to increased CO2 emissions from cement\nproduction (more factories became operational). Emissions\nBiennial Transparency Report 3 |\n\nfrom the Energy Sector had increased over the years largely due\nto increased importation of fossil consuming vehicles in the\ntransport sector.\nFigure 1.5: Kenya`s Sectoral greenhouse gas emissions percentage share of national total emissions in 2022 including LULUCF\nThe current level of emissions from LULUCF is 653 percent\nabove the 1990 level, while IPPU is 381% above that of the\n1990, agriculture sector is 131 percent, and energy sector is\n206% (table 1.2). Detailed results by sector and\nsource categories for each of the inventory period 1990 to 2022\nare provided in chapters 3-6.\nEmission trends by gas\nMethane (CH4) and Carbon dioxide (CO2) dominate Kenya’s\nincrease in greenhouse gas emissions (table 1.3 and figure\n1.6). In 2022, CH4 comprised 51 percent of total CO2 equivalent\n(CO2eq) emissions, whereas CO2 contributed 44 percent and N2O,\n5 percent. Therefore, CO2 and CH4 remain the major greenhouse\ngases in Kenya’s historical emissions profile. Figure 2.6 illustrates\nthe share of emission by gas type.\nFigure 1.6: Kenya’s emissions share by gas in 2022\nTable 1.3: Kenya`s emissions by gas 1990 - 2022 (Gg CO2 Eq)\nGHG Type\n1990\n2000\n2010\n2020\n2022\n% change\n1990 - 2022\nCO2\n6,622.4\n7,136.2\n29,334.8\n58,674.7\n67,114.2\n913%\nCH4\n17,036.2\n15,865.0\n23,843.3\n45,599.8\n42,127.5\n147%\nN2O\n1,935.2\n2,043.8\n2,682.9\n4,055.9\n4,124.4\n113%\nTotal Emissions\n(Gg CO2eq)\n25,593.7\n25,045.0\n55,861.1\n108,330.4\n113,366.0\n343%\nThe growth in CH4 emissions can be associated with increased\nnumber of livestock population. The growth in CO2 represents\nthe increased emissions from the LULUCF and energy sectors,\nin particular transport sub-sector.

In 2010, the Government of Kenya (GoK) enacted a\nnew constitution which created a devolved, two-tier government\nconsisting of a National government and County governments. The\nconstitution and the new government structure have established\n47 constitutionally distinct County Governments that have defined\nspheres of power and functions.\nThe Government of Kenya has established a structure that assigns\nthe coordination of climate change affairs to the Ministry of\nEnvironment, Climate Change and Forestry, State Department for\nEnvironment and Climate Change. Overarching policy, coordination\nand oversight of climate change affairs is performed by the\nNational Climate Change Council, chaired by the President.\nThe Climate Change Directorate, established by the Climate\nChange Act, 20161 , is the lead agency of the government on\nnational climate change plans and actions to deliver operational\ncoordination. The Directorate performs coordination work through\nthe Climate Change Units established in all ministries, counties,\ndepartments and agencies.\nPopulation Profile\nKenya is a middle-income developing country in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica with a stable democratic government. Kenya has a 2022\nprojected population of 50,622,914 based on the Kenya population\nand housing census conducted in 20192 . As highlighted above,\nthere are 47 county governments with different population\nprojections. Population is projected to increase during the entire\nforecast period, with an estimated population of 70,179,943 by\n2045. The six top counties expected to experience the highest\npercentage of the population are Samburu, Tana River, Narok,\nLamu, Wajir and Turkana. In terms of numbers, Nairobi, Kiambu,\nNakuru, Narok and Kakamega counties are expected to have the\nhighest increase.\nData from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) on\nhousehold projections show that there were approximately\n13,478,733 households in 2022 and are expected to increase to\n15,908,968 by 2030.\nGeographical Profile\nKenya is a tropical, water-scarce country located on the equator\nin East Africa. It shares international borders with Ethiopia to\nthe North, South Sudan to the North-West, Uganda to the West,\nTanzania to the South and Somalia to the East.\nThe total surface area is about 610,000 square kilometres\ncomprising of land area of approximately 580,609 sq.km, water\narea of approximately 11,362 sq.km and terrestrial water area\nof approximately 18,029 sq.km.\n| 6 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nClimate Profile\nKenya has a number of distinct climatic and ecological zones, linked\nin part to its widely varying topography. The coastal region in the\nEast, bordering the Indian Ocean, is characterized by predominantly\nflat plains with warm, humid weather. The plains give way to vast\nsprawling savannah in the South-East lowlands, dominated by\ngrassy ecosystems with an arid and semi-arid climate3.\n3 https://www.climateimpacts.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/KE_FINAL_12-Apr_ONLINE.pdf \nKenya has two main wet seasons: March to May is referred to\nas the “long rains”, and October to December as the “short rains”.\nParts of the country experience a third wet season between June\nand August.\nKenya’s landscape can be categorized into three major climatological\nzones, distinguished primarily by the distribution of rainfall: arid\nand semi-arid, tropical, and temperate (see figure 2.1).\n\nFigure 2.1: Kenya’s topography and climate are highly diverse. Situated between 5° N and 5° S latitude and 34° E and 42° E longitude, Kenya’s geography spans low-lying\ncoastal regions up to the towering peaks of Mount Kenya in the central highlands.\nThe arid and semi-arid lands are characterized by low and erratic\nrainfall, strong winds and intense sunlight for most of the year.\nThey provide generally hostile environmental conditions and\nfrequently experience drought. Kenya’s temperate zones are\ntypically highland areas, such as the Lake Victoria basin and\nMount Kenya regions.\nThese zones are characterized by cool temperatures and relatively\nhigh rainfall. The tropical zones, predominantly the plateaus,\nreceive moderate rain during the two main wet seasons and\nserve as transition zones between temperate and arid areas\n(see figure 2.2).\n\nFigure 2.2: Kenya has three main climatic zones, according to the Köppen–Geiger classification. Arid and semi-arid regions (orange) cover most of the land area, with the\ntropical (red) and temperate (green) climates less dominant.\nKenya is exposed to climate hazards or the actual biophysical\nevents that are driven by climate change. Slow onset climate\nhazards, such as temperature increase, drought, changes in\nprecipitation patterns, and sea level rise have intensified.\nBiennial Transparency Report 7 |\n\nAcute climate hazards, such as extreme precipitation, floods,\nlandslides, and wildfires, are expected to increase in frequency\nand severity in Kenya.\nClimate change is, therefore, causing an increase in average global\ntemperatures, increasing temperatures, changing precipitation\npatterns, and rising sea levels, creating significant environmental\nand economic disruption and adversely affecting Kenyans. The\nimpacts of climate change and climate-related disasters are felt at\nthe household level through food insecurity, damage to property,\nincreased prices of food and fuel, and declining access to water\nand other environmental services.\nEconomy\nThe Kenya Vision 2030 aimed to achieve a 10% annual GDP\ngrowth rate by 2012 and sustain it up to the year 2030. However,\nbetween 2012 and 2022, annual GDP growth rate averaged 4.8%.\nThis performance fell short of the target of 10 percent annual\ngrowth due to various factors, including: the adverse effects of\nclimate change, which has resulted to recurring drought and\ninvasion of pests and diseases; rising oil prices; exchange rate\nvolatility; the COVID-19 pandemic; geo-political conflicts, terrorist\nattacks and piracy incidents. Kenya’s annual GDP growth rate in\ncomparison to lower middle-income and upper middle-income\ncategories between 2007 and 2022 is presented in Figure 2.3.\n\nFigure 2.3: Kenya’s annual GDP growth in comparison to Lower Middle-income and Upper Middle-income categories, 2007-2022\nKenya made progress towards the attainment of a middle-income\ncounty status as envisaged in the Kenya Vision 2030. The country\ntransitioned from a low-income status to a lower middle-income\nstatus upon attaining a GDP per capita of US$ 1,430 in 2014.\nThe GDP per capita improved to US$ 2,240 in 2022. However,\nKenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita performance\nhas been lower than the average for lower middle-income and\nupper middle-income categories between 2007 and 2022, as\nshown in Figure 2.4\n\nFigure 2.4: Kenya’s GDP per capita (USD) in comparison to Lower Middle-Income and Upper Middle-income categories, 2007 - 2022\nSectors with significant contribution to economic growth in Kenya\ninclude Agriculture and livestock; Manufacturing; Tourism; Trade;\nBusiness process outsourcing; and Financial services.\nAgriculture and livestock sector aims to promote an innovative,\ncommercially oriented and modern agriculture. The sector majorly\ncontributed towards the attainment of food and nutrition security,\nincome generation, employment creation, and enhancing export\nearnings. Agriculture contribution to GDP marginally decreased from\n21.7 % in 2007 to 21.2% in 2022. The performance was attributed\nto adverse weather conditions in some years and increasing costs\nof farm inputs. The share contribution of agriculture, forestry and\nfishing to GDP in Kenya compared to lower-middle-income and\nupper middle-income countries between 2007 and 2022 was\nhigher, indicating that the country is still heavily dependent on\nagriculture (See figure 2.5).\n| 8 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nFigure 2.5: Share contribution of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing to GDP in Kenya compared to Lower Middle-Income and Upper Middle-Income categories, 2007 - 2022\nKenya aims to have a robust, diversified and competitive\nmanufacturing sector. The sector supports the country’s socioeconomic development agenda through job creation, foreign\nexchange generation and foreign direct investment attraction.\nThe contribution of the manufacturing sector to GDP declined\nfrom 10.4% in 2007 to 7.8 per cent in 2022 against a target of\n15%. The decline was due to high cost of production, competition\nfrom counterfeit goods, low technology adoption and recurring\ndrought. The sector facilitated export-oriented investment by\ndeveloping Athi River textile hub; modernizing Rivatex Textile\nFactory; and initiating the establishment of Special Economic\nZones in Dongo Kundu and Naivasha. The share contribution of\nmanufacturing to GDP in Kenya in comparison to lower middleincome and upper middle-income countries between 2007 and\n2022 (see figure 2.6).\n\nFigure 2.6: Share contribution of Manufacturing to GDP in Kenya compared to Lower Middle-Income and Upper Middle-Income categories, 2007 - 2022\n2.1.2.\nInstitutional Arrangements\nDue to these impacts which continue to disrupt the country’s\neconomy, Kenya has prioritized climate change response and\nput in place an elaborate policy, legal and institutional framework\non climate change. Kenya communicated an ambitious updated\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the secretariat of\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC) in December 2020 to demonstrate its global commitment\nto addressing the adverse effects of climate change in the context\nof sustainable development and eradication of poverty.\nKenya has established an elaborate institutional arrangement\nfor addressing the adverse impacts of climate change and\nimplementing the NDC. The institutional arrangement takes a\nmulti-stakeholder approach recognizing the role of state and\nnon-state actors at both the national and county levels.\na) Climate Change Act 2016 (Revised Edition 2023)\nKenya enacted its climate change law, the Climate Change Act, in\n2016, which it revised in 2023 to integrate carbon markets. The Act\nis applied for the development, management, implementation and\nregulation of mechanisms to enhance climate change resilience\nand low carbon development for the sustainable development\nof Kenya.\nThe 2023 revised edition of the Climate Change Act 2016 provides\nan elaborate institutional arrangement for implementing and\ntracking the Kenya Nationally Determined Contributions. The Act\nestablished the National Climate Change Council, which provides\noverarching national climate change coordination mechanisms.\nThe Council is comprised of members drawn from both state and\nnon-state actors, including the youth, marginalised communities,\nand academia, to facilitate stakeholder engagement in policy,\ncoordination and oversight of climate change response in Kenya.\nThe Act further establishes the Climate Change Directorate as\nBiennial Transparency Report 9 |\n\nthe lead agency of the government on national climate change\nplans and actions to deliver operational coordination of climate\nchange response.

The Least Cost Power Development Plan is a rolling\n20-year plan prepared biennially (since 2011), and five-year\nmedium-term plans compiled to guide particularly the expansion\nof the electricity sector.\nIn 2020, the plan was updated with emphasis on the prioritization\nof renewable energy options for generation of electricity. The\nexpansion of the grid (electricity network) has enabled the\ndispatch of more renewable electricity and improved the grid’s\nrobustness to take up more renewable energy sources especially\nwith regards to the instantaneous, daily and seasonal variability.\nSubsequent updates of the plan have sustained this trajectory\nachieving 89.8% and 87.7% electricity generated from renewable\nenergy sources in the years 2021 and 2022 respectively.\nBiennial Transparency Report 31 |\n\nTable 2.7: Overview of the mitigation policies and actions in the Energy Sector..\n Mitigation policies and measures, actions and plans, including those with mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification plans,\nrelated to implementing and achieving a nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement\nName\nDescription\nObjectives\nType of\nInstrument\n(Regulatory,\nEconomic,\nVoluntary,\nother)\nStatus\n(Planned,\nadopted,\nImplemented)\nSector(s)\naffected\nGases\naffected\nStart year of\nimplementation\nImplementing\nentity or\nentities\nEstimates of GHG emission\nreductions (kt CO2 eq) (j, k)\nAchieved | Expected\nLeast Cost\nPower\nDevelopment\nPlan\nThe Government through\nthe Ministry responsible\nfor Energy has over the\nyears been undertaking\npower development\nplanning for the country\nthrough the Least Cost\nPower Development Plan\n(LCPDP).\nUpdates of the Least\nCost Power Development\nPlan are prepared\nbiennially (since 2011)\ncovering 20-year periods,\nand five-year mediumterm plans compiled in\nalternate years.\nThe 20202022 plan\nemphasized\nthe\nprioritization\nof renewable\nenergy options\nfor generation\nof electricity.\nThe expansion\nof the grid\n(electricity\nnetwork)\nhas enabled\nthe dispatch\nof more\nrenewable\nelectricity and\nimproved its\nrobustness\nsources\nespecially with\nrelation to the\nvariability of\nthe RE to take\nup more of\nthe renewable\nenergy.\nEconomic\nRegulatory\nAdopted\nEnergy\nCO2\n2011\nMinistry of\nEnergy and\nPetroleum\nEnergy and\nPetroleum\nRegulatory\nAuthority\n(EPRA)\nKenya Power\nand Lighting\nCompany\n(KPLC)\nKenya\nElectricity\nGenerating\nCompany\n(KENGEN)\nGeothermal\nDevelopment\nCompany\n(GDC)\nKenya\nElectricity\nTransmission\nCompany\n(KETRACO)\n18,000\n904.316\n| 32 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n2.4.3.\nTransport Sector\nGHG emissions from the transport sector have always constituted\na significant share of the total emissions, consistently being\nthe most significant source of emissions in the energy sector,\nparticularly due to its reliance on fossil fuels. With population\ngrowth, modernization of society and increasing economic\nprosperity, there has been a sustained surge in motor vehicle\nownership and use, which is a significant contributor to GHG\nemissions, primarily due to the reliance on petrol and diesel\nvehicles. Increased economic activities mean more goods and\npeople need to be transported, further raising emissions. As one\nof the main contributors to emissions in the country, the transport\nsector is at the heart of achieving the NDC target.\nThe Government’s Bottom-Up Economic Transformation Agenda,\nwhich is currently being implemented through the Fourth Medium\nTerm Plan 2023 – 2027 of the Kenya Vision 2030 Agenda,\nrecognizes the role e-mobility could play in the attainment of\nnational development and environmental goals. With the objective\nof achieving a low carbon and efficient transportation system in\nthe NDC, the transport sector aims to promote several identified\nmitigation measures such as: Transfer of freight from road to\nrail; Transition to e-mobility; Electrification of the Standard gauge\nrailway between Nairobi and Mombasa by 2022, among others.\nThe total length of the rail network in the country is 2,778 km\ncomprising both the meter-gauge track and the standard-gauge\ntrack. In 2017, the construction of Phase I of the Standard Gauge\nRailway spanning 472 km of track from the port city of Mombasa\nto Nairobi was completed, this has significantly reduced freight\nand passenger tariffs and travel time and led to a significant shift\nof freight and passengers from road to rail. The cargo transported\nusing the railway system increased from 1,380,000 tonnes in 2016\nto 6,090,000 tonnes in 2022. The passenger per km increased\nfrom 113 million in 2016 to 2,392 million in 2022. (source KNBS\nEconomic Survey 2018 and 2023). This is observed in the trend\nof emissions for heavy-duty vehicles which declined in 2017.\nThe National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (2020)\nenvisions that by 2025, 5 % of all registered vehicles in Kenya will\nbe electric powered.\nAs of 2022, the sector was not able to implement most of the\nplanned actions for the achievement of the NDC, due to inadequate\nfinancial support.\nBiennial Transparency Report 33 |\n\nTable 2.8: Overview of the mitigation policies and actions in the Transport Sector.\n Mitigation policies and measures, actions and plans, including those with mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification plans,\nrelated to implementing and achieving a nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement\nName\nDescription\nObjectives\nType of\nInstrument\n(Regulatory,\nEconomic,\nVoluntary,\nother)\nStatus\n(Planned,\nadopted,\nImplemented)\nSector(s)\naffected\nGases\naffected\nStart year of\nimplementation\nImplementing\nentity or\nentities\nEstimates of GHG emission\nreductions (kt CO2 eq) (j, k)\nAchieved | Expected\nTransfer of\nfreight from\nroad to rail\nbetween\nNairobi and\nMombasa\n30% of freight from\nMombasa to Nairobi\nshifted from road to rail.\nThe transfer of freight\nfrom road to rail between\nNairobi and Mombasa\nin Kenya is part of the\nKenya Railway Expansion\nproject, which aims to\nreduce road damage and\nprovide a faster and safer\nintercity transportation\nsystem.\nThe project includes\nthe Mombasa-NairobiMalaba Corridor, which\nconnects the Port of\nMombasa to Nairobi and\nMalaba, Uganda.\nReduce fuel\nconsumption\nand fuel\noverhead costs\nEconomic\nAdopted\nTransport\nCrosscutting\nCO2\n2018\nMinistry of\nRoads and\nTransport\nKenya Railways\nNE\nNE\n| 34 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n2.4.4.\nLand Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Sector\nThe Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) sector plays\na critical role in achieving the NDC. The sector is central to Kenya’s\nclimate action, providing significant mitigation potential through\nsustainable forest management, afforestation, reforestation, and\nlandscape restoration initiatives. These actions are complemented\nby policies and measures that prioritize climate-smart agriculture,\nagroforestry, and nature-based solutions, ensuring the integration\nof adaptation co-benefits. Additionally, economic diversification\nplans focusing on green jobs and sustainable livelihoods enhance\nthe sector’s contribution to emissions reductions while fostering\ncommunity resilience and environmental sustainability.\nThis section outlines the key mitigation policies, actions, and plans\nfor the sector, designed to advance Kenya’s NDC commitments\nwhile addressing broader socio-economic and environmental\nobjectives. These include the commitment to progressively\nachieve a minimum of 10% tree cover across the total land area;\nefforts towards achieving land degradation neutrality; scaling up\nnature-based solutions (NBS) for mitigation and enhancement\nof REDD+ activities.\nIn its efforts to achieve 10% tree cover, Kenya implemented the\nstrategy for increasing tree cover to at least 10% of the total land\narea by 2022. As a result, approximately 80,398.5 hectares were\nsuccessfully planted with trees through afforestation, reforestation,\nand agroforestry initiatives. On-the-ground initiatives that were\nimplemented, such as the Green Zones Support Project Phase II\nand the Adopt a Forest Initiative, actively engage stakeholders to\nrestore degraded landscapes, enhance forest cover, and integrate\ntree planting with agricultural practices.\nKenya, in its efforts to enhance REDD+ activities, finalized its\nREDD+ Strategy in 2021, which outlines an ambitious framework\nfor implementing national REDD+ activities to reduce emissions\nfrom deforestation and forest degradation while promoting\nconservation, sustainable forest management, and enhancement\nof forest carbon stocks. The strategy identifies key areas of\nfocus to address deforestation and forest degradation, including\nscaling up afforestation, reforestation, and landscape restoration\nprograms. It also emphasizes improving governance and policy\nimplementation to curb the conversion of forests to other land\nuses and increasing the productivity of public plantation forests.\nIn addition, the strategy seeks to enhance efficiency, effectiveness,\nand skill development across forest-related value chains, ensuring\nsustainable utilization of forest resources.\nRecognizing the importance of financial resources, the strategy\nprioritizes the mobilization of funding to support the implementation\nof REDD+ initiatives in Kenya. It is worth noting that Kenya has\nnot implemented REDD+ at the national level. As of 2022, Kenya\nwas at the REDD+ readiness phase. However, several site-level\nREDD+ activities, such as the Kasigau Corridor REDD project\n(phases I and II), Mikoko Pamoja Mangrove Restoration in Gazi\nBay and the Chyulu Hills REDD+ Project, are being implemented\nin the voluntary carbon markets.\nAdditionally, Kenya has operationalized other policies and measures,\nactions and plans related to implementing and achieving her NDC\nwithin the forestry sector. The National Forestry Programme\n(2016-2030) aims to enhance forest restoration, agroforestry and\nsustainable land use, contributing to socio-economic growth and\nclimate resilience. Community involvement is also paramount\nin enhancing forest conservation and management efforts and\nis encouraged through legislative measures like the Forests\n(Participation in Sustainable Forest Management) Rules, 2009,\nwhich promote collaborative forest management between local\ncommunities and the Kenya Forest Service (KFS). This has borne\nfruits in the management of existing forests reducing conversions\nto other uses and reforesting degraded areas.\nAll these, and many other efforts within the sector, collectively\ntarget greenhouse gas reductions, particularly carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), and increasing\nof sinks across the land-use, land-use change, and forestry\n(LULUCF) sectors.\nBiennial Transparency Report 35 |\n\nTable 2.9: Overview of the mitigation policies and actions in the LULUCF sector.\n Mitigation policies and measures, actions and plans, including those with mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation actions and economic diversification plans,\nrelated to implementing and achieving a nationally determined contribution under Article 4 of the Paris Agreement\nName\nDescription\nObjectives\nType of\nInstrument\n(Regulatory,\nEconomic,\nVoluntary,\nother)\nStatus\n(Planned,\nadopted,\nImplemented)\nSector(s)\naffected\nGases\naffected\nStart year of\nimplementation\nImplementing\nentity or\nentities\nEstimates of GHG emission\nreductions (kt CO2 eq) (j, k)\nAchieved | Expected\nStrategy\ntowards the\nattainment\nof 10% tree\ncover by 2022\nA comprehensive\napproach to expand\nforest and tree\ncover across public\nand private lands\nthrough afforestation,\nreforestation and\nlandscape restoration\nTo increase the\ncountry’s tree\ncover to 10% by\n2022\nRegulatory\nEconomic\nImplemented\nForestry\nAgriculture\nCO2\n2018\nMinistry of\nEnvironment,\nClimate\nChange and\nForestry\nKenya Forest\nService\nNE\nNE\nNational\nREDD+\nStrategy 2021\nStrategy for REDD+\nimplementation in Kenya\nTo Scale-up\nreforestation\nand enhance\ngovernance\nand policy;\nand mobilize\nfinance for\nREDD+\nRegulatory\nEconomic\nPlanned\nForestry\nCO2\n2021\nMinistry of\nEnvironment,\nClimate\nChange and\nForestry\nKenya Forest\nService (KFS)\nDevelopment\npartners\nNE\nNE\n| 36 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n2.4.5.\nIndustrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) Sector\nThe Government initiated the development of policies and\nmeasures in industrial processes and product use to enhance\nmanufacturing sector resource efficiency and introduce a circular\neconomy to reduce material extraction used in production.\nFurther setting up structures for extended producer responsibility\nimplementing the Sustainable Waste Management Policy 2021\nand National Sustainable Waste Management Act 2022.

(2024). Kenya’s Adaptation Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and Forestry,\nNairobi, Kenya.\nKenya is a signatory to both the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement\nthat it adopted in 2015. The country recognizes the challenge\nassociated with addressing the causes and impacts of climate\nchange globally and locally. As such, Kenya through its Nationally\nDetermined Contributions on adaptation (NDC) is committed to\ntaking action to contribute to the implementation of the Global\nGoal on Adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening\nresilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change. This\nchapter aims to communicate the country’s progress towards all\nsubstantive aspects of the Paris Agreement regarding adaptation\n(under Article 7) and loss and damage (under Article 8).\nPreparation of this chapter was guided by Decision 18/CMA.1\nchapter IV of the UNFCCC as well as Kenya’s National Adaptation\nPlan 2015-2030 (NAP) whose vision is “enhanced climate resilience\ntowards vision 2030”.4 The communication in this chapter builds\non Kenya’s updated NDC, 2020 and draws on the recent adaptation\ntechnical analysis report (ATAR) for the National Climate Change\nAction Plan (NCCAP) III 2023-2027, NCCAP progress reports,\nand Kenya’s draft Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC.5\nThis chapter provides information on Kenya’s national context,\nrisk and vulnerability profile; national adaptation priorities and\nbarriers; adaptation strategies, policies, goals and plans to integrate\nadaptation into Kenya’s Climate Action; implementation progress,\nresults evaluation and learning; and averting, minimizing and\naddressing loss and damage associated with climate change\nimpacts.\n3.2.\tNational Context, Risk, and Vulnerability Profile\n3.2.1.\nNational Circumstances relevant to adaptation actions\nGeographic Profile\nKenya is located in the East African region between latitude 5°\nNorth and 5° South and is bisected by the equator, and between\nlongitudes 34°E and 42° East. It borders South Sudan, Ethiopia, and\nSomalia to the north; Uganda to the west; Tanzania to the south;\nand the Indian Ocean to the east. The total land area is 569,137\nsquare kilometres. Mount Kenya is the highest point in Kenya at\n5,199 metres above sea level and the lowest point is at sea level\non the Indian Ocean. The country is situated within the Greater\nHorn of Africa which is a generally dry region characterised by\nfrequent droughts that are punctuated by heavy rainfall events\nthat often result in flash floods.

The urban population was about 28 percent. The census\ndetermined that Kenya had a population density of 82 persons\nper km2. In 2019, Kenya youths under the age of 35 years made\nup 75 percent of the population and were comprised of children\n(0-14 years) - 18,541,982 (39.0 percent), adolescents (10-19 years)\n- 11,631,929 (24.5 percent), and youths (18-34 years) - 13,777,600\n(29.0 percent).

The working age population (15-64 years)\nwas 27,151,134 (57.1 percent) persons in 2019.6\nWeather and Climate\nKenya is made up of seven agro-ecological zones which experience\nvarying climates and weather patterns.7 The arid regions of the\ncountry receive annual average rainfall of between 200 and 500\nmm and annual temperatures range from 23°C to 34°C. The semiarid areas experience an average annual rainfall of 600 to 1,000\nmm and are slightly cooler in temperature. The arid and semi-arid\nlands are characterized by low and erratic rainfall, strong winds\nand intense sunlight for most of the year.8 The coastal climatic\nzone, a band approximately 16 kilometres wide, is humid all year\nround with an average annual temperature range of 22°C to 30°C\nand an average rainfall of between 1,000 and 1,250 mm. The\nmost temperate zones are the Central and Western highlands and\nparts of the central Rift Valley with annual rainfall levels averaging\nbetween 950 and 3,000 mm and average annual temperatures\nranging between 14°C to 28°C.\nKenya Meteorological Department (KMD) data indicates that\nKenya’s temperatures vary, with the highlands experiencing\nconsiderably cooler temperatures than the coastal and lowland\nregions. The months of June to August are characterised by\ncooler temperatures while the highest temperatures are typically\nexperienced during the month of March. Kenya’s annual rainfall\nfollows a bimodal seasonal pattern, commonly referred to as\nthe “long rains” season occurring in March, April, and May, and\nthe “short rains” season, occurring in October, November, and\nDecember. Another season takes place from June to August\nover the coastal region and the Highlands West of the Rift Valley.\nAverage annual precipitation in Kenya is typically 680 mm, ranging\nfrom less than 250 mm in parts of the northern arid and semi-arid\nland (ASAL) areas to about 2,000 mm in the high rainfall zone\nin the Western region, that includes the country’s productive\nagricultural land.9\nFigure 3.1: Observed Annual Precipitation in Kenya 1991 - 2020 (Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)2\n| 42 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nFigure 3.2: Observed Annual Average Mean Surface Air Temperature in Kenya 1991 – 2020 (Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)3\n10 Rathore, V.

Kenya: IMF Country Report No. 22/382. https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/ Publications/CR/2022/English/1KENEA2022003.ashx\nKenya’s ASALs generally experience hostile weather and\nenvironmental conditions and frequently experience drought,\n10while the country’s temperate zones are characterized by cool\ntemperatures and relatively high rainfall. The tropical zones,\npredominantly the plateaus, receive moderate rain during the\ntwo main wet seasons and serve as transition zones between\ntemperate and arid areas.11 According to the World Bank’s climate\nprofile analysis for Kenya, the high rainfall temperate zone, which\nreceives more than 1,000 mm of annual rainfall, is the productive\nagricultural land. It occupies less than 20% of the country’s land\narea and carries approximately 80% of the population.12\nThe Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (ATAR 2023-2027)\n13reported that Kenya experienced below average rainfall in most\nareas and drought in the ASALs between 2014 and 2023. In early\n2023, Kenya, like other countries in the Horn of Africa, experienced\nthe longest and most severe drought on record, the result of a\nculmination of five consecutive failed rain seasons in most parts,\nthe longest such sequence in 40 years.14\nThe severity of the drought was lessened with the onset of\nthe 2024 long rains (March–May), which were heavier than\naverage and caused loss of life and significant damage to\nproperty. Communities with high levels of climate vulnerability\nare particularly impacted by sequential climate events; where a\nsubsequent climate hazard (i.e., extreme rainfall) impacts the\nsocio-ecological system before full recovery from the previous\nhazard (i.e., drought). Compound drought-extreme rainfall events\nare occurring with greater frequency and intensity, reducing the\navailable recovery time and eroding the capacity for resilience.\n\nFigure 3.3: Observed Annual Precipitation of Kenya for 1901 -2022(Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)\nEconomic Profile\nKenya is a lower-middle-income economy and among the fastestgrowing economies in Africa. Kenya’s gross domestic product\n(GDP) was USD 115.08 billion and GDP per capita was USD 2,220\nin October 2024.15 The World Bank reported that Kenya’s GDP\nincreased by 4.8 percent in 2022 and 5.4 percent in 2023; but is\nexpected to slow down to 5.0 percent in 2024. The poverty rate\n($2.15 international poverty rate) is projected to decline from 35.1\npercent in 2023 to 34.3 percent in 2024. Kenya has a favourable\nmedium-term economic outlook with projected GDP growth of\n5.2 percent for 2024-2026, although the economy is susceptible\nto climate-related risks, such as extreme weather conditions.16\nThe agricultural sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting\nfor approximately 20% of Kenya’s GDP.17 The country’s highlands\nhost significant farmlands as well as the majority of the population.\nThe highlands are relatively cool and agriculturally rich, and\nare largely dominated by commercial and small-holder farms.\nPrincipal cash crops include tea, coffee, flowers, vegetables,\nBiennial Transparency Report 43 |\n\npyrethrum.

The country experiences\nfrequent droughts that are punctuated by heavy rainfall events\nthat often result in flash floods. More than 70% of disasters\nfrom natural hazards are estimated to be attributable to extreme\nclimatic events.20These disasters include major droughts that\noccur every 10 years, and moderate droughts or floods every\nthree to four years. The repeating cycles of floods and droughts\nhave had devastating socioeconomic impacts and high economic\ncosts, have eroded the adaptive capacity of communities and\necosystems, and have negatively impacted livelihoods and the\noverall economy of the country. The 2008 – 2011 drought is\nestimated to have cost Kenya USD12.1 billion, including USD\n805.6 million for the destruction of physical and durable assets.21\nDroughts have affected more people than floods and have had\nthe greatest economic impact (averaging 8% of GDP every five\nyears).22Although droughts often affect the whole country, the\nmost severe impacts are felt in the country’s highly arid zones,\nwhich include many of the poorest counties. The local economies\nin these counties depend heavily on pastoralism and the resulting\nrangeland degradation and loss of livestock erodes their capacity\nto cope and adapt to further climate impacts.\nIn Kenya, agriculture is the main productive sector and is critical\nfor food security and economic stability. The sector accounts for\napproximately 20% of Kenya’s GDP and employs more than 40%\nof the total population and more than 70% of the rural population.\nIt largely remains rainfed making it exposed and vulnerable to\nthe changing climate. Drought and floods cause significant\nloss of livestock, crops, and harvest resulting to loss of income\nand livelihoods at household level, and episodes of acute food\ninsecurity, particularly in the arid counties. Climate impacts on\nthe agriculture sector heavily affect young people by reducing\nincomes and limiting their transformation towards climate-smart\nor modernized agriculture which is capital-intensive.\nSocio-economic losses associated with climate change in Kenya\nover the past decade amounted to between 3% and 5% of GDP\nper annum.23Modelling estimates in the LTLED strategy suggest\nthat Kenya’s losses could rise to between 6.5% and 8.5% of GDP\nper annum between 2021-2050.24Kenya could lose up to USD 11\nbillion each year because of climate change, however the modelling\nindicates that about one-third of this loss can be averted through\nadaptation action.25 As such, adaptation is a primary concern\nwith respect to climate change.5\n3.2.2.\tInstitutional Arrangements and Governance\nIInclusion of diverse actors in climate change action, and particularly\nin adaptation supports compliance with the Constitution of\nKenya 2010, the Climate Change Act, 2016, and other subsidiary\nlegislation that provides for public participation in such matters.\nBelow is a summary of key institutions and actors responsible\nfor adaptation in Kenya and their roles.\nThe National Climate Change Council\nThe National Climate Change Council, established under the\nClimate Change Act, 2016 and chaired by the President, guides\nthe implementation of adaptation action and receives at least biannual reports on the implementation of NCCAPs. The council’s\nmandate is to provide legislative and policy direction, supervision,\noversight and guidance on climate change across all levels of\ngovernment. The Council will administer the climate finance\nmechanism (Climate Change Fund), including approving requests\nfor funding, making funding allocation decisions, and improving\nthe tracking and coordination of climate finance.26\nThe Climate Change Directorate\nIn Kenya, climate action is coordinated by the Climate Change\nDirectorate (CCD), State Department of Environment and Climate\nChange, in the Ministry of Environment, Climate Change and\nForestry. The CCD is the National Focal Point for the UNFCCC and\nworks under the guidance of various climate change policies and\nlegislative frameworks including the Climate Change Act, 2016.\nThe Act designates CCD the lead agency of the government on\nnational climate change planning and action, including coordination\nof adaptation planning.\nThe CCD has the central responsibility for coordination of\nreporting on adaptation, which requires coordination with other\ninstitutions with various mandates on reporting; expertise on\ndata collection, processing and reporting; data flows; systems\nand tools for adaptation action monitoring and reporting; and\nstakeholder engagement.\n| 44 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nSector Ministries\n27 Republic of Kenya (2016).

The National Treasury, in the Ministry of Finance and Planning\nis host to the Climate Change and Green Finance unit, and plays\na key role in climate financing, including adaptation finance. The\nNational Treasury coordinates and facilitates activities related to\nclimate finance, including leading the implementation of activities\nunder the Financing Locally-led Climate Action program that has\nestablished county climate change funds in all 47 countries. The\nNational Treasury is Kenya’s Nationally Designated Authority for\nthe Green Climate Fund.27\nNational Government Sector Agencies\nThese are tasked to integrate the National Climate Change\nAction Plan into their sectoral strategies, action plans and other\nimplementation projects; and designate a unit with adequate\nstaff and financial resources to coordinate the mainstreaming\nof the NCCAP and other climate change statutory functions\nand mandates into sectoral strategies for implementation.\nFor example, the NDMA coordinates the Kenya Food Security\nSteering Group, a multi-agency team that carries out biannual\nassessments of the impacts of short and long rains on food and\nnutrition security with a view of informing drought response and\nresilience building activities including adaptation to drought risk\nacross 23 ASAL counties.28The Authority is expected to report\nannually to the National Climate Change Council through the\nClimate Change Directorate on the status and progress of climate\nchange adaptation and resilience in the ASALs.6\nCounty Governments\nAt the sub-national level, the 47 county governments are responsible\nfor operationalising climate change planning and budgeting\nwithin their jurisdictions. All counties have designated a County\nExecutive Committee member responsible for climate change\nand created a Climate Change Unit (CCU) to coordinate climate\nchange action. Many counties also have county and ward climate\nchange planning committees supporting locally-led planning\nand implementation of climate adaptation actions. The Ward\nClimate Change Planning Committees help communities to\nwork in a participatory manner to analyse their resilience to\npresent and future climate risks and use the findings to prioritise\ninvestments that the County Climate Change Funds (CCCFs) can\nsupport. County level committees help to refine the investment\nplans from Wards and support prioritization based on available\nresources; membership of the County Climate Change Planning\nCommittees is drawn from county government departments,\nnational government institutional offices in the counties (e.g.,\nKenya Meteorological Department and National Environmental\nManagement Authority); non-governmental organisations (NGOs),\ncommunity-based organisations, the private sector, and local\ncommunities.\nPrivate sector\nThe private sector continues to engage and complement government\nefforts on climate change and have been an invaluable partner for\nadaptation action. Through the NAP Readiness Support Project\n(2018 – 2020) that was funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF)\nand implemented through the Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO), the Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) created the\nClimate Business Information Network-Kenya (CBIN-K) and the\nPrivate Sector Strategy on Climate Change Solutions in Kenya\n(2022-2030). 29\nPublic Benefit Organizations (NGOs, INGOs, CBOs)\nIn Kenya, the civil society is known to be a powerful agent of\nchange through public awareness creation, policy research and\nanalysis, and advocacy on key socio-economic issues including\nclimate change. They also undertake vulnerability assessments,\nbaseline studies and research; advocacy, capacity building and\nawareness creation; policy development and promotion of good\ngovernance; information sharing; gender mainstreaming in\nclimate change; monitoring and early warning systems; livelihood\nsupport; promotion of improved technologies and efficient use of\nenergy; humanitarian support; and promotion of use of indigenous\nknowledge. They play similar roles in the implementation of\nadaptation actions.7\nResearch and Academia\nThis group of actors plays a key role in building the country’s\nadaptive capacity. They help to provide the evidence for knowledgebased decision making by the national and county governments,\nprivate sector, development partners and civil society amongst\nothers. This is done through research conducted on different\naspects of climate change adaptation and resilience, including\nimproving the understanding of climate change attribution in Kenya\nand providing information on the appropriate mix of adaptation\nactions in order to avoid maladaptation.\nBiennial Transparency Report 45 |\n\nThe Media\nThe media in Kenya provides vital information at times of emergency\n— from warning of imminent floods to explaining how to deal\nwith drought emergencies and disease outbreaks. Media houses\nare actively involved in the dissemination of climate information,\nincluding progress on the implementation of adaptation activities.\nStrategic actions that improve climate change journalism can\nthemselves be forms of adaptation because accurate, timely\nand relevant information is a critical component of resilience.\nDuring the Africa Climate Change Week and Summit in Nairobi\nin 2023, the media played a great role educating the public and\ndisseminating progress and outcomes from the meeting.\n\nFigure 3.4: Climate Change Institutional Coordination Structures in Climate Change Act 2016 (Source: National Adaptation Plan, 2015)\n3.2.3.\nLegal and Policy Frameworks, Strategies and Plans\nKenya has a strong history of climate change governance beginning\nwith the enactment of the new constitution and development of\nthe National Climate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS) in 2010.\nThe policy and legal framework for adaptation includes three\nNational Climate Change Action Plans (2013 - 2017, 2018 - 2022,\n2023 - 2027), NAP (2015 - 2030), and Climate Change Act 2016.\nKenya submitted her first Nationally Determined Contribution\n(NDC) in 2016 and an updated version in 2020. The NDC responds\nto both domestic needs and international obligations under the\nUNFCCC and Paris Agreement and includes a section on adaptation\npriorities that are aligned with the NAP and NCCAPs. As stated in\nthe NCCAPs, NAP, and NDC, adaptation is the priority for Kenya.\nIn Kenya, climate change issues are given a high priority, as such\nthe Ministry of Environment and Forestry was re-designated in\nOctober 2022 to include climate change, and is now referred to\nas the Ministry of Environment Climate Change and Forestry\n(MoECCF).\n| 46 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nLaws and Policies\nTable 3.1: Summary of the key legal and policy documents related to climate adaptation\nLaw\nDescription\nThe Constitution of Kenya, 2010\nThe mother law in Kenya. Article 42 establishes Kenyans’\nright to a clean and healthy environment including the right\nto have the environment protected for the benefit of present\nand future generations. A healthy environment calls for the\nsustainable use of ecosystems and consequently continued\naccess to ecosystem goods and the services they provide\nwhich are critical for adaptation.\nClimate Change Act, 2016\nThe Climate Change Act enacted in 2016 was the first\ncomprehensive legal framework for climate change\ngovernance in Kenya with the objective of enhancing climate\nresilient development through among others promoting the\nuptake of technologies that support low carbon and climate\nresilient development; facilitating capacity development\nfor public participation in climate change responses\nthrough awareness creation, consultation, representation\nand access to information; and providing incentives and\nobligations for private sector contributions towards climate\nresilient development. Additionally, the Act provides for and\nsupports mainstreaming of climate adaptation actions into\ndevelopment planning, decision-making, and implementation.\nIt sets out principles for climate change planning and\nimplementation of measures, and recognises the\ncomplementary role of national and county governments. The\nlatter is critical considering the local nature of adaptation. The\n2023 amendment provided for the introduction and regulation\nof carbon markets in Kenya, which provide a potential source\nof finance for adaptation actions.\nUrban Areas and Cities (Amendment) Act, 2019\nThe urban development legislation provides for the\nestablishment and governance of urban areas (i.e., cities,\nmunicipalities, towns, and market centres). The legislation\nprovides the legal mandate for planning and development in\nurban areas, and the implementation of key actions in these\nareas, which contributes to the balance between urbanisation\nand sustainable development. These bodies play a key role in\nintegrating climate resilience considerations and adaptation\nactions in urban centres.\nThe National Drought Management Authority Act, 2016\nCreates the National Drought Management Authority\n(NDMA) as a permanent institution with a specific mandate\nof managing drought in a more pro-active and sustainable\nmanner. It recognises drought as the most important climaterelated hazard for Kenya and the need to sustainably invest\nin building resilience to drought in a coordinated manner. The\nAct also establishes the National Drought Emergency Fund to\nfinance timely responses to drought and to support capacity\nstrengthening in drought management.\nEnvironmental Management and Coordination (Amendment)\nAct, 2015\nEmphasises maximum participation by stakeholders in the\ndevelopment and implementation of policies, plans, and\nprocesses for the management of the environment and\nprovides for the relevant institutional framework for the\ncoordination of environmental management including the\nNCCAPs. The Act provides for environmental protection\nthrough environmental impact assessment; environmental\naudit and monitoring; and environmental restoration orders,\nconservation orders, and easements.\nBiennial Transparency Report 47 |\n\nPolicy\nDescription\nNationally Determined Contribution, 2020\nThe updated NDC communicated the country’s adaptation\npriorities and needs to the international community.

The goal is to promote climate resilient\ndevelopment through pursuing several objectives including\nproviding an effective and efficient institutional framework\nfor mainstreaming climate change; reducing vulnerability and\ncatalysing the transition to climate-resilient development;\nincentivising private sector involvement; and providing a\nframework for resource mobilisation in support of adaptation\nNational Climate Finance Policy, 2018\nEstablishes the legal, institutional, and reporting frameworks\nto access and manage climate finance, consistent with\nthe institutional structures and framework set out in the\nClimate Change Act, 2016. Interventions with respect to this\npolicy include establishing a national Climate Change Fund,\nidentifying climate financing sources, and creating a national\nsystem for tracking climate finance. Its operationalisation\nis meant to address the issue of inadequate finance for\nadaptation interventions.\nNational Urban Development Policy, 2016\nThe urban development policy, together with the Urban Areas\nand Cities (Amendment) Act, 2019, provide a framework\nfor the establishment and governance of urban areas (i.e.,\ncities, municipalities, towns, and market centres). The\npolicy guides planning and development in urban areas,\nand the implementation of key actions in these areas,\nwhich contributes to the balance between urbanisation and\nsustainable development. These bodies play a key role in\nintegrating climate resilience considerations and adaptation\nactions in urban centres.\nStrategies and Plans\nTable 3.2: Summary of national and sectoral strategy and planning documents related to climate adaptation\nStrategy/Plan\nDescription\nNationally Determined Contribution, 2020\nThe updated NDC communicated the country’s adaptation\npriorities and needs to the international community.

Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate\nchange in priority sectors include the policies and strategies,\ncoordination structures, planning cycles (guidelines and\ntemplates), investments, and financing. It is used for\nimplementing both the NDC and NAP and most of the actions\nare adaptation. The NCCAP was updated in 2023. Updating\nand/or revision of the NCCAP is an inclusive process involving\nboth levels of governments, private sector, research and\nacademia, communities, CSOs, media, and other actors in\nclimate adaptation.\nGuidance on Climate-related Risk Management, 2021\nThis guidance, issued by the Central Bank of Kenya, aims\nto guide institutions licensed under the Banking Act on\nclimate-related risk management. The guidance sets out\nbasic requirements for financial institutions in regard to the\nidentification, management, and reporting of climate-related\nrisks, including physical risks that result from the impacts of\nclimate- and weather-related events.\nNational Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, 2019 - 2030\nGuides strategies aimed at addressing declining biodiversity\nand related challenges. It aims to reduce the loss of\nbiodiversity, promote the value of biodiversity, and improve\ncommunity livelihoods. Highlighted adaptation interventions\ninclude conservation of agricultural biodiversity through\nincreased support to local communities in the production and\nsustainable utilisation of indigenous and/or traditional species\nfor food and other uses; strengthening institutional and\ncommunity capacity and linkages; promotion of gender equity\nin biodiversity management; and supporting and promoting\nthe utilisation of indigenous knowledge, innovations, and\npractices among others.\nKenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Implementation\nFramework, 2018 - 2027\nProvides guidelines for the implementation of the CSA\nstrategy at national and county levels in support of food\nsecurity and economic development. The national government\nis largely expected to lead on policy development and\nsupport capacity building, while county governments lead on\nimplementation since agriculture is a devolved function.\nKenya Climate-Smart Agriculture Strategy, 2017 - 2026\nAims to improve productivity and build the resilience of\nagricultural systems while minimising greenhouse gas\nemissions. Recognises the high vulnerability of the agriculture\nsector and identifies priority interventions for building\nresilience of the sector through the implementation of Climate\nSmart Agriculture (CSA) practices in the crop, livestock, and\nfisheries sectors in support of food and nutrition security and\npoverty reduction.\nBiennial Transparency Report 49 |\n\nStrategy/Plan\nDescription\nClimate Risk Management Framework, 2017\nThe framework bridges climate change adaptation, disaster\nrisk management, and sustainable development at national\nand county levels. The framework ensures that the three\ndistinct entities are pursued as mutually supportive rather\nthan stand-alone goals and that an integrated approach to\nclimate risk management becomes a key component of\npolicy and strategy for resilience building. The adaptation\nactions under this framework include analysing exposure and\nvulnerability to disasters, and capacity to respond; mobilising\nfinancial resources for climate risk management; designing\nand implementing pilot projects for climate risk management\nat county and national levels; enhancing research and\ndissemination of information about climate risk management;\nand building capacity at national and county levels for\nintegrated climate risk management.\nNational Adaptation Plan 2015 - 2030\nThe long-term plan aims at consolidating the country’s vision\non adaptation by supporting macro-level adaptation actions\nthat are aligned with the economic sectors and addressing\ncounty-level vulnerabilities to enhance long-term resilience\nand adaptive capacity. It is implemented through the fiveyear NCCAPs. The NAP highlights climate vulnerabilities\nand priority areas for building climate resilience. It presents\nadaptation actions that cover the time frame 2015 - 2030 and\nbuilds on the foundation laid by the National Climate Change\nResponse Strategy (NCCRS) and the NCCAP 2013-2017.\nFurthermore, it is the basis for the adaptation component of\nKenya’s NDC.\nNational Climate Change Response Strategy, 2010\nThe NCCRS formally recognised the need for coordinated\nefforts in addressing climate change issues in Kenya. It\nrecommended the development of a climate change policy\nand legislation on which adaptation activities were to be\nanchored. Consequently, a stand-alone climate change act\nand related governance structures and plans (e.g., NCCAP and\nNAP) were developed and supported coordinated adaptation\naction. Some of the priority adaptation actions highlighted in\nthe climate change response strategy included: promoting\norphan crops; agricultural produce post-harvest processing,\nstorage, and value addition; breeding of animals from various\nagro-ecological zones that adapt well to climatic variances;\nproviding special livestock insurance; establishing a national\nclimate awareness campaign; and incorporating climate\nchange in the school curriculum within Information and\nawareness building.\n3.2.4.\nSub-national Level Legal Frameworks, Policies and Strategies8\n30 Government of Kenya. (2024).\nThe Climate Change Act, 2016 requires county governments to\nintegrate climate change actions into their plans and policies.\nCounty governments have progressively been incorporating climate\nchange initiatives into their plans and programmes as mandated,\nmaking use of the five- year County Integrated Development Plan\n(CIDP) process as the main instruments to mainstream climate\nchange actions in development planning. Typically, the CIDPs\nintegrate adaptation actions alongside mitigation and other types\nof climate resilience interventions including enabling actions like\nclimate finance, which is now legally mandated in all 47 counties\nthrough climate change-specific policies and legislation.30\nSome counties have also developed strategies and regulations\nto operationalise climate-related legislation. The County Climate\nChange Fund (CCCF) mechanism that aims to enhance access\nand channel climate finance to the community level is now\nestablished and operational in the 47 counties in Kenya. Through\nthis mechanism, each county government sets aside a minimum\nof 1.5% of their development budgets for climate actions,\nallocated through the respective County Climate Change Fund. In\naddition, County Climate Change Action Plans are mainstreamed\ninto the County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs) that are\nimplemented over five years through the Annual Development\n| 50 Biennial Transparency Report\n\nPlans (ADPs). Many counties have climate change governance\nstructures down to the ward level which is the lowest administrative\nand planning unit. Local communities are facilitated to identify\nand prioritise mostly climate adaptation interventions through\n31 Nying’uro et al. (2024).\n32 Trisos, C.H. et al. (2022).

This is achieved with the support of the climate change\nplanning committees at the county and ward levels, making use\nof relevant resilience planning tools and climate information.\nCase study: CCCF Mechanism as a strategy for adaptation\nThe integration of climate information into planning and\nimplementation has been supported through county-specific\nClimate Information Services (CIS) plans prepared by the Kenya\nMeteorological Department (KMD), working with other partners.\nThese CIS plans support effective, locally-led adaptation because\nthey are based on local needs and contribute to improved access\nand use of climate information at institutional and household\nlevels. Designated agencies for disaster management also make\nuse of climate information services at the sub-national level for\npreparedness and response. For example, the NDMA currently\nsupports the 23 ASAL counties with Drought Early Warnings that\nare issued monthly to aid drought preparedness and early action.\nThe CCCF mechanism was initially piloted and operationalized\nin rural counties; however, the more complex urban contexts\nwith projected exponential population growth required a tailored\napproach. Through urban policy and legislation, Kenya has 5\ncities and over 70 municipalities with governance structures\nthat support integration of local climate actions including the\nmainstreaming of climate-resilient development pathways in the\nprovision of necessary urban infrastructure and services. Nairobi\nand Mombasa cities have just set up their CCCF mechanisms\nwith support from FLLoCA programme.\n3.2.5.\nCapacity-building and Capacity Gaps and Needs\nCapacity building is concerned with enhancing the ability of\ninstitutions and communities to effectively carry out climate\nadaptation actions. Institutional and technical capacity development\nis critical in the delivery of proposed adaptation actions as prioritized\nin national planning documents and country plans. The Climate\nChange Act 2016 established a number of institutions and set\nmandates for existing institutions in regard to climate action in\nKenya. Significant progress has been made on operationalisation\nand strengthening of the institutional structures set out in the\nClimate Change Act (Amendment, 2023), including the National\nClimate Change Council, CCD, National Environment Management\nAuthority (NEMA), Climate Change Fund, Kenya Institute of\nCurriculum Development (KICD), Kenya School of Government\n(KSG), Council of Governors (CoG), and Climate Change Units\nboth at national and county level. It is notable that to more\neffectively support climate action, including climate adaptation,\nthe National Climate Change Fund became operational in 2022\nand is managed by the National Treasury. Climate Change Units\nat both national and county government levels also have focal\npoints, officers leading and coordinating on climate action. Gaps\nand needs on capacity building are further discussed in section\n3.5.3 (3) on capacity needs. 9\nClimate Change Hazards, vulnerabilities and impacts in Kenya\nThis section includes a summary of key climate hazards, vulnerabilities, and risks and impacts on different sectors\nof the economy. The information in this section draws on Kenya’s Adaptation Communication (2024 draft), as\nwell as county level Participatory Climate Risk Assessments facilitated through the Financing Locally-Led Climate\nAction (FLLoCA) program under the National Treasury & Economic Planning.\n3.2.6.\nClimate Hazards\nAnalysis in the Kenya National Adaptation Plan (2015 – 2030) and\nthe National Climate Change Action Plans demonstrates that Kenya\nis exposed to climate hazards and details the actual biophysical\nevents that are driven by climate change. It is estimated that over\n70% of natural disasters in Kenya are attributable to extreme\nclimatic events – particularly flooding and droughts. Evidence\nshows that climate change increased the intensity of rainfall in\nthe short rainy season in the Horn of Africa in 2023, leading to\nsevere flash flooding in the eastern region which caused more\nthan 300 deaths and displaced over a million people.31Studies\nhave not reached consensus on whether droughts have been\nincreasing or decreasing overall in East Africa since the 1950s;\nhowever, research indicates that since 2005, droughts have\ndoubled in frequency from once every six years to once every three\nyears in the region.32 Typically, major droughts occur in cycles of\napproximately ten years, and moderate droughts or floods have\nbecome common every three to four years. Apart from eroding the\ncapacity to adapt, the repeating cycles of flooding and droughts\nhave socio-economic impacts and high economic costs.\nFor example, the 1998 to 2000 drought cost an estimated US$2.8\nbillion, principally due to crops and livestock loss, as well as forest\nfires, damage to fisheries, reduced hydropower generation, reduced\nindustrial production and reduced water supplies.33 Another\nsevere and prolonged drought from 2008–2011 affected 3.7\nmillion people, caused US$12.1 billion in damages and losses,\nand cost over US$1.7 billion in recovery and reconstruction needs.\n34 Figure 3.5 below demonstrates the number of people affected\nby key natural hazards between 1980 and 2020.\nBiennial Transparency Report 51 |\n\nFigure 3.5: Key Natural Hazard Statistics for 1980 – 2020 (Source: WB Climate knowledge portal)\nMajor climate hazards in Kenya are categorised into two groups: acute climate hazards and chronic or slow onset hazards.

Average rainfall is expected to increase by midcentury, particularly during the ‘short rains’, which occur between\nOctober and December.37 Increased aridity and drought have been\nobserved, with extreme rainfall events occurring with greater\nfrequency and intensity. Extreme events from 2018 to 2024 in\nKenya included flash floods, floods, landslides, and rising lake\nlevels.38 A climate change vulnerability assessment in the Upper\nEwaso Nyiro basin (an ASAL ecosystem) showed that there has\nbeen high climate variability over 30 years especially within the\nlong rains in March, April, and May. 39\nc) Sea Level Rise and Temperature Increase\nKenya is experiencing sea level rise, and the rate of sea level rise\nalong the Western Indian Ocean is estimated to be 4.0mm/year\ncompared to the global average of 3.4mm/year.40 Sea levels are\nexpected to continue to rise along Kenya’s coast (Figure 3.7\nillustrates the expected increase under Representative Concentration\nPathway (RCP) 4.5, which is the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change’s moderate scenario in which greenhouse gas\nemissions peak around 2040 and then decline). Increasing sea\nsurface temperatures, marine heatwaves, and ocean acidification\nalongside rising sea levels and stronger storm surges impact marine\nlife, lead to coastal erosion, and increase the risk of flooding in\nthe five coastal counties (Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi, Tana River, and\nLamu). Global projections of 21–48 cm of sea level rise by the\nend of the 21st century compared with the 1980–1999 average\ncould be devastating for Kenya.41 A 30 cm increase in sea level\nrise could submerge 17% of the city of Mombasa, Kenya’s second\nlargest city and the largest seaport in East Africa.42\n\nFigure 3.7: Projected Sea level rise along the Kenyan coast between 2008–2098 (RCP 4.5) (World Bank, 2024)\n3.2.7.\nClimate Change Vulnerability\nThis section discusses Kenya’s exposure, sensitivity and overall\nvulnerability to climate change and how it affects climate\nadaptation. The IPCC defines vulnerability as “the propensity or\npredisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety\nof concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility\nto harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt.”43The IPCC\nframework demonstrates that climate risks are the product of the\ninteraction between climate hazards, vulnerability and exposure\nof the relevant systems, sectors or populations.\nKenya ranked 135th out of 187 countries in 2022 according to the\nNotre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) index, which\nranks countries on their level of vulnerability to climate change\nand readiness to implement adaptation solutions 44(See figure\n3.8). it was the 135th most vulnerable country and the 146th most\nready country – implying that it is very vulnerable to, yet unready\nto combat the impacts of climate change.45\nFigure 3.8: ND-GAIN Index for Kenya: Vulnerability Dimension (World Bank, 2024)11\nBiennial Transparency Report 53 |\n\nThe summary in table 3.4 demonstrates that the high levels of\nclimate vulnerability in Kenya are attributable to a number of\nkey factors: a low-lying coastline; heavy dependence on rainfed\nagriculture; water scarcity; insecure land tenure; environmental\ndegradation; and conflicts over natural resources like water and\npasture during the very dry seasons.46 Apart from low-lying coastal\nregions that are very exposed to sea level rise, communities and\nsystems in the ASALs, which constitute up to 89% of the land\narea and 38% of the country’s total population,47 are particularly\nvulnerable to climate change because of high levels of poverty\nwhich limit their adaptive capacity and increase their exposure\nto recurring droughts. Crop and livestock production in the\nASALS are impacted by droughts and flash flooding. The most\naffected counties with above-normal livestock mortality rates\n(5%) in 2023 were ASALs and included Marsabit, Kajiado, Isiolo,\nSamburu, Turkana, Wajir, and Mandera.

Over 51% of the urban population in Kenya\nin 2020 was considered poor and living in unplanned informal\nsettlements without basic infrastructure and services, which\nincreases their vulnerability for climate risks.50 Inadequate\nplanning, environmental management, and enforcement often\ncontributes to flash flooding in informal settlements that occupy\nlow lying riverine areas and floodplains.12\nTable 3.4: Summary of the key sources of vulnerability in Kenya and identifies the most vulnerable groups\nClimate Change Vulnerability\nKey Sources of Vulnerability\n\t• Poverty, with 7.1% of the population considered poor in 2022\n(living on less than USD 1.90 per day); with high levels of\nmulti-dimensional poverty in the ASALs 51\n\t• Significant disparities between rural and urban areas, poverty\nrates in rural areas were 6.5 times higher than urban areas in\n2022\n\t• Population growth, with 75% of the population under the age\nof 35 in 2019\n\t• Gender inequality\n\t• High reliance of the national economy and local livelihoods on\nnatural resources\n\t• High dependence on rainfed agriculture and insufficient\nirrigation systems; 98% of agriculture production is rainfed\n\t• Water scarcity and mismanagement of water resources\n\t• Environmental degradation, including loss of forest cover\n\t• Pastoral mobility\n\t• Insecure land tenure and land fragmentation\n\t• Migration to urban areas\n\t• Poor urban and land-use planning; rapid and haphazard\nurbanisation\n\t• Large number of informal settlements due to rural–urban\nmigration\n\t• Limited access to quality healthcare, particularly in rural areas\n\t• Inadequate access to improved technologies\n\t• Inadequate finance to address climate change priorities\nParticularly Vulnerable Groups\n\t• Pastoralist communities, hunters and gatherers, and fisher\ncommunities\n\t• Women\n\t• Children/Youth\n\t• Persons with disabilities\n\t• Elderly\n\t• People with small landholdings and/or livelihoods\ndependent on natural resources\n\t• People living in informal settlements\nParticularly Vulnerable Regions\n\t• Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs)\n\t• Flood prone areas including low-lying coastal regions,\nfloodplain and riverine areas like the Tana Delta, Kano\nPlains and Budalang’i\n\t• Informal urban settlements in low lying riverine areas and\nfloodplains\n\t• Mountainous regions\n| 54 Biennial Transparency Report\n\n3.2.8.\nClimate Change Risks and Impacts in Kenya\nThe LTLED Strategy (2017 – 2022) indicated that adaptation actions\nhave the potential to reduce this loss by about one third over the\nsame period highlighting the need to implement priority actions.\nTable 3.5 below includes information on key climate risks and\nimpacts based on NCCAP III priority areas.\nTable 3.5: Key Climate Risks and Impacts in Kenya\nBiennial Transparency Report 55 |\n\nSector\nRisks\nImpacts\nDisaster Risk\nManagement\nSevere\ndrought\n\t• Droughts cause decline in water levels affecting agricultural activities, livestock keeping,\nand in the worst cases causing loss of lives.\n\t• Droughts contributed to conflicts, deteriorating health conditions, and forced\ndisplacement in large parts of the ASALs.\nHeavy rainfall\nand flooding13\n\t• Flooding causes deaths, displacement of populations, property destruction, and\ndisruption of agriculture and livelihoods. Floods in 2023 affected 38 counties across\nKenya, resulting in loss of lives, injuries, displacements, and destruction of key\ninfrastructure. An increase in contaminated water also led to secondary effects, including\nvector and waterborne disease outbreaks. 757,173 people (138,560 households) were\naffected since the onset of the short rains season between October and December\n2023.52\n\t• In March 2023, heavy rains led to widespread flooding across several counties, including\nMombasa, Kwale, Tana River, and others. These floods resulted in 36 fatalities and left 29\npeople injured, affecting a total of 139,135 individuals. Infrastructure damage, particularly\nto roads and homes, compounded the impact on affected communities.53\nFood Nutrition\nand Security\nChanges in\ntemperature\nregimes and\nprecipitation\npatterns\n(associated\nwith\ninsufficient\navailability\nof water,\nexcessive\nmoisture\nconditions,\npests,\ndiseases, and\nweeds)\n\t• The 2014-2018 drought was declared a national emergency in February 2017, having\naffected 23 out of the 47 counties, with counties in ASALs being the most affected with\nat least 3.4 million people being severely food insecure.54\n\t• The cumulative impact of the below-average short rains in 2018 followed by the poor\n2019 long rains season increased the number of people in Kenya affected by food\ninsecurity.55 from 0.7 million in late 2018 to 3.1 million in late 2019\n\t• The biggest impacts are expected on maize and wheat production owing to their high\nvulnerability to heat stress. Maize is the staple food in Kenya while wheat-based foods\nare an important source of nutrition.\n\t• Heavy rainfall has led to increased flows on large rivers, such as the Tana, resulting in\nflooded farmlands, degraded soils and reduced farm output.56\n\t• Heavy rains in 2019 and 2020 created conditions conducive to the severe desert locust\noutbreaks in 2020 which affected the food supply of about 2.5 million people and\nlivelihoods of some 3.5 million people.\n\t• Overall, between 2014 and 2023, when an estimated 5.1 million Kenyans (27% of\nthe ASAL population) were facing high levels of acute food insecurity and in need of\nhumanitarian assistance because of drought.57\n\t• Recurring droughts coupled by increased demand for land have forced an estimated 30%\nof livestock owners out of pastoralism over the past 20 years.58\n\t• From 2007 to 2017, losses in livestock populations due to drought-related causes\namounted to about USD 1.08 billion.59\n\t• The effects of climate-related temperature rise on human labour is also linked to impacts\non food and nutrition.

It has been estimated that between 1995 and 2019, the percentage\nof Kenyans living under water-stressed conditions increased from 14.8% to 33.2%, partly\nattributed to climate change impacts.61\n\t• Climate change impacts on water resources have affected agriculture through loss\nof crops, human health through water-borne diseases associated with flooding and\ndestruction of key related infrastructure.\n\t• Increase in water demand from population growth and an expanding economy\ncompounds the water availability challenges presented by climate change.62For example,\nduring long dry spells like in 2018, many urban areas faced acute water shortages due to\nlow water levels in rivers.\n\t• Changes in rainfall have increased water levels63in Kenyan lakes. The increase in the\narea of lakes in the Great Rift Valley, ranging from a 21% increase for Lake Naivasha to a\n123% increase for Lake Solai, leadinghas contributed to changes in flora and fauna and\naffectingaffected local communities that rely on these natural aquatic resources.64\n\t• Sea level rise is a risk to the five coastal counties and their populations; an estimated\n267,000 Kenyans will be at risk of coastal flooding by 2030 due to sea level rise.\n\t• Climate change is also causing storms and rougher seas, which prevents fisher\ncommunities from earning a living and obtaining fish for sustenance, especially in the\nmonths of May, June, and July.\n\t• Sea level rise is projected to increase the levels of salinity in coastal freshwater aquifers,\nwhich would exacerbate the current water supply issues.\n\t• Crop production may be hampered by salt stress brought on by the waterlogging of the\nsoils. Additionally, because saline water intrusion impacts coastal ecosystems, the health\nof coastal inhabitants is at stake.65\n\t• Sea level rise is a risk to the five coastal counties and their populations; an estimated\n267,000 Kenyans will be at risk of coastal flooding by 2030 due to sea level rise.\n\t• Sea level rise is projected to increase the levels of salinity in coastal freshwater aquifers,\nwhich would exacerbate the current water supply issues.\nForestry,\nWildlife and\nTourism\nRising\ntemperatures\nand changing\nprecipitation\npatterns;\nprolonged\ndroughts and\nflooding\n\t• Forest degradation, damage and transformation of forest areas, and changes in species\ncomposition.\n\t• Prolonged droughts weaken forests, making them more susceptible to pests, diseases,\nand forest fires, further contributing to their degradation. Wildfires are particularly\ncommon during dry seasons and destroy large forests areas whenever they occur.\n\t• Rainfall variability and prolonged drought are already altering wildlife migrations, affecting\ntourist visits on big nature reserves such as the Maasai Mara.66\nEcosystems and\nBiodiversity\nRising\ntemperatures\nincluding\nwarmer\nnights,\nchanging\nprecipitation\npatterns;\nprolonged\ndroughts,\nflooding14\n\t• Ecosystems and critical ecosystem services in Kenya are deteriorating in quality and\nquantity. This affects the provision of water, food and timber; air purification; carbon\nsequestration; flood control; soil and habitats; and cultural, spiritual and recreational\nservices.\n\t• Climate change facilitates the spread and establishment of many Invasive Alien Species\n(IAS) and creates new opportunities for them to become invasive with devastating\nimpacts on the native species and biodiversity.67\n\t• Projections indicate that species richness along the Tana River basin – an economically\nimportant and ecologically diverse region – is projected to reduce significantly with just\n2°C of global temperature rise with plants and birds most affected. And the impacts\nworsen with further warming. While 82% of the basin can offer protection for the majority\nof plant species with 1.5°C of warming, this figure reduces to 23% with 2°C of warming\nand to just 3% with 4.5°C of warming.68\n\t• There will be a substantial climate-driven shift in vegetation towards more shrubland\n(normally associated with arid lands) at the expense of savannahs, grasslands and\nforests. Consequently, protected areas in Kenya could lose between 16% and 50% of their\nforests, depending on future emissions.69\n61 Nying’uro et al. , (2024)\n62 GoK. (2020). Updated NDC\n63 GoK. (2020).

For example, the heavy rainfall experienced throughout the year\n2023 resulted in destruction of roads across different parts of the country. Several roads\nwere cut off by flash floods in Tana River, Garissa, Wajir and Mandera.76\n\t• The Kenya Highways Authority participated in a vulnerability assessment of the Horn of\nAfrica Gateway project, a large road infrastructure project, that found projected increased\nrainfall is expected to increase the risk of flooding, erosion, washouts, and siltation, and\nto aggravate connectivity problems.77\n\t• Climate-related weather extremes also impact the design, construction, location, and\noperation of electricity generation and transmission infrastructure. For example, a\nvulnerability assessment of hydroelectric energy resources impacted by climate change\nin the Seven Forks project found that the catchment temperature is rising by 0.02°C\nannually while the rains are declining by 3.9 mm annually.\n\t• The rapid decline of Mount Kenya’s glaciers is affecting hydropower generation, which is\ncurrently extremely reliant on the Mount Kenya region, with the Tana River contributing\naround 70% of Kenya’s total hydropower generation.78\n\t• Masinga dam, one of the main Seven Forks reservoirs for hydroelectric power production\nalong the Tana River, faces inflow drop of 0.74 cubic metres of water per second annually,\nleading to an average power output below capacity by up to 16-Gigawatt hours annually.79\n3.3.\tNational adaptation priorities and barriers\n3.3.1.\nPriorities for Adaptation in Kenya\n76 KMD.

A County Executive Committee Member\nappointed by the Governor coordinates climate change affairs\nat the County level and is reporting for reporting on progress of\nimplementation of climate change actions to the County Assembly\nand the Climate Change Directorate.\nFurther, the National Policy on Climate Finance (2018) and The\nNational Green Fiscal Incentives Policy provides clear direction on\nmechanisms for enhanced mobilization of climate finance from\nall sources. The Climate Finance and Green Economy Unit at the\nNational Treasury and Planning is responsible for coordinating\nclimate finance mobilization and reporting in the country.\nCountry-driven strategies\nKenya’s country driven approach is embedded within Kenya’s\nclimate change legal and policy frameworks that set national\nclimate change priorities identified through sectoral needs’\nassessments and stakeholder consultation processes. The\nframeworks designate sector level actions that require support\nand form the basis for to address climate change.\nThe country recognizes the importance of developing needsresponsive interventions that enhance adaptive capacities,\nbuild resilience to climate change and reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions. In principle, all climate actions must be country\ndriven, and country owned, developed in a manner that is in line\nwith national climate plans and priorities in consultation with\nnational and county governments’ institutional structures, and\nstakeholders.\nKenya underscores the crucial importance of means of\nimplementation in driving successful implementation of climate\naction in line with national commitments. The country explores and\nadopts technologies as well as requisite capacity strengthening\nefforts to facilitate effective delivery of impactful actions. Examples\nof these technologies include drought-resistant crops and renewable\nenergy solutions, access to which is facilitated by collaboration\nwith international partners.

These\nefforts ensure that climate actions are sustainable and locally\ndriven. However, capacity building initiatives often struggle with\ninadequate funding, lack of infrastructure, insufficient human\nresources and inadequately address institutional capacity gaps.\nFinancial resources are critical to Kenya’s adaptation and mitigation\nstrategies. The country has made significant strides in mobilizing\nclimate finance from both domestic and international sources.\nHowever, there remains a huge gap between finance needed\nand what is availed. This gap leads to delays and comprises the\neffectiveness of efforts to address climate change. Additionally,\nKenya....\n6.2.\tUnderlying assumptions, definitions and methodologies\nIn determining support received, Kenya makes the following:\nAssumptions\n1.\nOn-budget and off-budget support was considered in this\nBTR, acknowledging existing limitations in off-budget\nsupport tracking and data compilation that require more\ncomplex and detailed tracking practices to be developed over\ntime. On-budget support refers to financial support received\ndirectly into Kenya’s budget from international sources.\nOff-budget refers to financial and in-kind (technological\nand technical assistance) resources received by the\ngovernment through non-governmental channels or offered\ndirectly to government agencies without direct financial\ninput to the national budget.\n2.\nFollowing the explanation above, we assume that Kenya\nreceived the full sum of indicated amounts within the\nJanuary 2021 to December 2022 period into the national\nbudget.\nDefinitions and methodologies\n3.\nOnly core climate change support is considered as support\nreceived. In this BTR, Kenya considers support received\nfrom projects whose main(core) objective is climate change\nmitigation and adaptation that are designated under the\nNDC. Development projects with climate benefits have\nnot been considered due to challenges in determining\nadditionality.\n4.\nThe BTR report only considers finance received and\nexpended (used) in contributing to the objectives of the NDC.\n5.\nIn principle, concessional loans received to support core\nclimate change projects shall count as Kenya’s climate\nfinance contribution. Kenya does not count market-rate\nloans (commercial loans) as climate finance.\n6.\nFinancial resources from the ex-chequer (internal budgetary\nallocation) are counted as Kenya’s own contribution.\n7.\nTo avoid double counting, this report has not considered\ninformation on support provided to Kenya based on the\nOECD/DAC data. This data will, however, be considered in\nfuture reports after Kenya develops an elaborate tracking\nsystem for climate finance.\n8.\nInformation on non-monetized climate support received\nhas not been included in the report. This is due to a lack\nof adequate information and data.\n40 Biennial Update Report\n\n6.3.\tInformation on financial support needed\nKenya conducted a technical analysis of the resources required to\nmeet the country’s NDCs’ targets. The technical analysis evaluated\nthe national and sectoral policies, plans, and strategies including\nidentified priority actions to inform data driven decisions based\non evidence and analytics. To complement the technical analysis,\ndata from available sectoral reports was assessed allowing for\nthe extraction of meaningful insights to better understand Kenya’s\npriorities in scaling up climate action in meeting our NDC targets.\nThe NDC targets cut across different sectors including disaster risk\nreduction, agriculture (crops, livestock, and fisheries), environment,\ngender, youth, and other vulnerable groups, as well as devolution.\nOverall, Kenya requires USD 62 billion until 2030 to support\nimplementation of NDC targets. Of this amount, mitigation\nactions for the period 2020-2030 require an estimated total of USD\n17,725 million with designated sectoral financial totals as follows:\nEnergy USD 8,890 million, Agriculture 250 million, Transport and\ninfrastructure USD 4,240 million, LULUCF USD 4126 million, and\nwaste USD 39 million. Of the total mitigation finance needed,\nKenya intends to shoulder 21% (3,725 million USD) from domestic\nsources subject to national circumstances, while the balance\nof USD 14,000 million (79%) is to be covered by international\nsupport. Adaptation remains a key priority for Kenya. To meet\nits adaptation costs for the period 2020-2030, Kenya requires an\nestimated USD 43,927 million. Subject to national circumstances,\nKenya intends to mobilize domestic resources to cater for 10%\nof the adaptation cost, while 90% of the adaptation cost, will\nrequire international support in the form of finance, technology\ndevelopment and transfer, and capacity building\n6.4.\tInformation on financial support received\nKenya has received a total of USD 507 Million in this BTR period.\nThis constitutes both on-budget and off-budget support. The onbudget support accounts for 89% of the total sum which is USD\n456 Million. USD 52 Million was delivered as grants, USD 365\nmillion was in loans. In line with Kenya’s NDC definition of climate\nfinance, the USD 365 million received as loans (both concessional\nand commercial) shall be counted towards Kenya’s contribution\nonce repayments are made. Off-budget support amounted to USD\n51 Million. This amount is not representative of the full support\nreceived during this period due to limitations in tracking various\nbilateral initiatives in Kenya. Kenya acknowledges the need to\ndesign and strengthen off-budget tracking mechanisms, and\nthe importance of international support towards this objective\nwithin the scope of availing support for reporting and building\nMonitoring, Reporting and Verification systems.\n6.5.\tInformation on technology development and transfer\nsupport needed by developing country Parties under Article\n10 of the Paris Agreement\nKenya’s technology development and transfer support needed is\nincluded in sectoral costs indicated in section 4.3 as estimated\nfinance needed to support technology development, and adoption.\nHowever, the methodology does not distinctly separate specific\nsupport needed for various technologies from the earmarked\npriority actions. Therefore, this BTR does not include specific\nfinance needed for technology development and transfer.\nKenya considers the development of a Technology Action Plan\nas an important intervention to assess the technological costs\nof various technologies identified in the NDC.\n6.6.\tInformation on capacity-building support needed\nThe support required for capacity-building initiatives during this\nBTR period is included in the total support needed (USD 62 billion)\nas outlined in section 4.3. Specific costing of capacity building\nneeds across each NDC target sector was not available.\n6.7.\tInformation on capacity-building support received\nKenya has received a total of USD 5.6 million towards capacitybuilding initiatives in this BTR period which was majorly from the\nGCF Readiness support. A total of USD 4.5 million was delivered\nas grants/technical assistance.\n6.8.\tInformation on support received for the preparation of\nthe BUR\nThe Global Environment Facility (GEF) funding under the Enabling\nActivities was Kenya’s only direct funding to prepare the initial\nBUR. Following the approval of the BUR1 project proposal, Kenya\nreceived funding support of $352,000 through the UN Environment\nas the implementing agency. The GEF funding enabled Kenya to\ncompile the initial BUR. Due to internal administrative challenges\nthat affected the disbursement of project funds from UNEP, the\nGEF implementing entity supporting Kenya, Kenya could not receive\nthe required resources within time to prepare the reports. The\ncontributions from the Transparency Accelerator Initiative, GIZ,\nNAP-Global, CIAT, Fauna & Flora and CBIT-GSP through technical\nassistance contributed to compiling the NC3 and BTR1.\nBiennial Update Report 41\n\nAnnex\nAnnex 1: National GHG Inventory Document.\n42 Biennial Update Report\n\nw w w . e n v i r o n m e n t . g o . k e",

Introduction: Project Overview \n \n1. The project titled ‘Strengthening National Institutions in Kenya to Meet the \nTransparency Requirements of the Paris Agreement and Supporting the Coordination \nof National, Regional and Global Transparency-related Activities in Kenya’ is a \nmedium-size project that was proposed by Conservation International (CI) and the \nGovernment of Kenya (GoK). The project was implemented over twenty-two-month \nperiod (22), inclusive of an initial 19-month period and a 3 month no cost extension, \nby CI as the Implementing Agency. The Project was executed by the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Natural Resources (MENR) through the Climate Change Directorate \n(CCD), the System for Land-Based Emissions Estimation in Kenya (SLEEK) program, \nVital Signs (VS) and the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute (GHGMI).  \n \n2. Implementation phase ran from January 15, 2018 to October 31, 2019. A kick-off \nworkshop was held in March 29, 2018. This project falls under the GEF’s climate \nchange focal area. The project had GEF funding of One Million United States dollars \n(USD 1 Million) and planned co-financing of $1.1 million hence the total project cost \nwas $2.1 million.  \n \n3. As stated in the Project Document, the project’s objective is: “to build Kenya’s \ninstitutional and technical capacities to meet the requirements of the transparency \nframework under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change”. The project was \nstructured in three components as follows:  \nComponent 1: Strengthening national institutions and capacities in Kenya to enhance \nMRV transparency in line with Kenya’s national priorities. This component aimed to \nachieve the following:  \n- \nOutcome 1: Institutional arrangements for data collection and sharing, quality \ncontrol and assurance, analysis and archiving will be strengthened in all the 6 \nIPCCC sectors and 47 counties.  \n- \nOutcome 2: Through targeted training, capacity of stakeholders (in 6 sectors \nand 47 counties) will be built on data collection and processing protocols and \ntools for GHG inventory preparation, forecasting, and management. \n- \nOutcome 3: A functional GHG inventory and MRV system for NDC tracking and \nreporting will be in place, with climate data and two climate action registries, \nwith the objective of integration into policy making. \n- \nOutcome 4: Public climate expenditure will be included in the MRV system for \nNDC tracking. \n \n \n \n1 USD are used throughout, unless otherwise noted. \n\n \n \n6 \nComponent 2: Supporting enhancements to SLEEK to assist with improvement of \ntransparency over time. This component aimed to achieve the following outcomes: \n- \nOutcome 1: Enhance the existing institutions and arrangements among SLEEK \ndata-contributing organisations for land sector data exchange and \ncoordination, including the REDD+ activities, with CCD. \n- \nOutcome 2: Support the institutional and technical capacity enhancement of \nthe various organisations involved in collection and reporting of activity data \nfor the land sector. Some non-sector specific capacity building training for the \nland sector players will be carried out under Component 1 while the land-\nsector and SLEEK specific aspects will be carried under Component 2. \n- \nOutcome 3: Streamline the QA/QC processes used in the data collection and \ndata preparation \nComponent 3: Supporting the enhancement of the coordination between national, \nregional, and global transparency related activities in Kenya. This component aimed \nto achieve the following outcomes: \n- \nOutcome 1: Set up a coordination platform that will be a combination of web-\nbased information, newsletters, in person meetings, and coordinated events \nto share ideas across the GoK ministries, departments, and professionals. \n- \nOutcome 2: Coordinate the multiple on-going initiatives that continue to be \ninitiated from various development partners \n- \nOutcome 3: Support the Climate Change Directorate to put in place a \nmonitoring and review process to provide the guidance necessary to shift \ncapacity-building efforts toward sustained and long-term capacity results \nbeing built at the institutional and systemic levels \n \n4. The project results framework is provided in the Project document (Prodoc). The \nproject results framework represents the primary foundational element for assessing \nresults (progress toward the expected outcomes and objective) and effectiveness.  \n \n5. According to GEF and CI-GEF evaluation policies and procedures, terminal evaluations \n(TE) are required for all GEF funded projects, and the terminal evaluation was a \nplanned activity in the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) plan of the CBIT project. The \nterminal evaluation reviews the actual performance and progress toward results of \nthe project against the planned project activities and outputs, based on the standard \nevaluation criteria: relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, results and sustainability. The \nevaluation assesses progress toward project results based on the expected objective \nand outcomes, as well as any unanticipated results. The evaluation identifies relevant \nlessons for similar projects and provides recommendations as necessary and \nappropriate. The evaluation methodology was based on a participatory approach, \nwhich included three main elements: a) a virtual inception workshop with the project \nexecuting agency, b) desk review of project documentation and other relevant \ndocuments; and b) stakeholder consultation using semi-structured interviews and  \nKey Informant interviews.  \n\n \n \n7 \n \n6. The evaluation is based on evaluative evidence from the project implementation \nphase through October 31, 2019. The evaluation commenced January 6th, 2020 with \nthe signing of the evaluation contract. The desk study was conducted from January 6 \nto February 11, 2020. A one-week field mission was carried out from February 10th -\n14th 2020 with the project evaluator visiting Nairobi, Kenya. \n \n2. Summary of Findings and Recommendations \n \n7. The project evaluation implemented the agreed methodology (see Annex A) \nconsistent with the GEF framework requirements. Evaluation investigation focused on \nassessing the extent the project achieved the target output and outcomes provided in \nthe results framework. Evaluators assessed these project results through the lens of \noutcome-based results, progress to impact, and theory of change. Specifically, the \nevaluation aimed to answer the following questions: did the project achieve its target \nobjectives and outcomes?; did project activities achieve progress to target impact?; \nand did such progress manifest the project’s theory of change?. In summary, the \nevaluators assessed whether project activities increased capacity for monitoring \nclimate change, improved GHG data for climate change monitoring and evaluation, \nand enhanced national and regional coordination to respond to the requirements set \nforth in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \n \n \n2.1. Outcome Ratings (Overall achievement of outcomes) \n \n8. The overall rating of project outcomes is based on performance of the following:  \na. Relevance  \nb. Effectiveness  \nc. Efficiency  \n \n9. Section 2 provides a summary of the terminal evaluation.  Subsequent sections \nprovide the further explanation for the ratings, as well as recommendations for \nconsolidating progress.  Annex E describes the ratings criteria.  \n   \n10. The overall project outcome rating is: Moderately Satisfactory. The project was \nrelevant to GEF objectives and satisfactorily managed. However, the evaluation \nresearch and interviews yielded evidence that the project fell short of achieving some \nof its intended outcomes. Furthermore, sustainability of the project investment and \nresulting outcomes are significantly at risk. The following sections discuss the specific \nGEF rating criteria areas of relevance, efficiently and effectiveness:  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n2.1.1. Relevance \n \nProject relevance is considered Highly Satisfactory. The project was specifically \nrequested by the GEF and clearly supported GEF priorities and strategies as well as \nnational priorities. The project conforms with GEF climate change strategies and \ndirectly supports national and international climate change strategic priorities and \ntargets consistent with the Biennial Update Reports (BURs), Nationally Determined \nContributions (NDCs) and with the overall Paris Agreement on climate change. The \nproject’s strategy focuses on building capacity of the country to generate GHG data \nthat will enable the country to meet its international reporting commitment whilst \nfacilitating national and regional coordination of transparency activities. \n \n2.1.2. Efficiency \n  \n11. Project efficiency is rated as Satisfactory. The project’s internal coordination, financial \nmanagement, adaptive management, and partnership approach are key evaluation \nfactors for project efficiency. The project’s M&E approach could have been \nstrengthened as discussed in more detail later in this report. The project faced delays \nduring implementation, which affected the project’s secondary results in terms of \noutreach and uptake of modelling results. Project financial management also could \nhave been strengthened. For instance, project participants reported that \nprocurement and contracting took longer than expected and negatively impacted \nstakeholder participation and engagement in key project activities such as workshop \nand training events.  \n \n2.1.3. Effectiveness \n \n12. Project effectiveness is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The project aimed to \nimprove institutional capacity for transparency, build incountry capacity to enhance \nthe quality of GHG data collected going forward and improve national and regional \ncoordination of climate transparency activities. Through the evaluation investigation, \nincluding in-country visits, improvement to institutional capacity was found to be \nlimited. Data intended to be enhanced through the project remained inaccessible \nand, by the account of project participants, flawed in terms of data quality and, \ntherefore, reducing its usefulness for decision making. Improvements to national \ncoordination were identified and evidenced by established data sharing protocols and \nenhanced inter-agency coordination to enable transparency for climate change \nmonitoring.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \n2.2. Sustainability Rating \n \n13. There are significant risks to sustainability of the project results and overall \nsustainability is considered Moderately Unlikely. At the time of the evaluation the \nproject activities appeared to have mostly stopped. Project participants and key \nstakeholders were unable to access key data resources intended to be developed \nthrough the project. Equipment procured through the project was only partly in use \nafter the end of the project. Participants who received training through the project’s \nactivities were no longer engaged in related activities to further the project objectives \nas they had left their employment or been moved to other roles focused on different \nobjectives. Key stakeholders, including Government participants, stated that the \nproject activities would not proceed further without additional external financial \nsupport. \n \n2.3. Environmental and Social Safeguards Rating \n \n14. Project safeguards were considered Highly Satisfactory. There were no significant \nissues noted related to the planning and implementation of environmental and social \nsafeguards.  \n \n2.4. Monitoring & Evaluation Systems Rating \n \n15. Monitoring & Evaluation was considered Moderately Satisfactory. The project M&E \noverall follows the GEF requirements and incorporates sound best practices.   A lack \nof an explicit Theory of Change was an identified shortcoming, making M&E against \nproject objectives difficult. \n \n2.5. Implementation and Execution Rating \n \n16. Implementation and execution were considered Moderately Satisfactory. The project \nexhibited sufficient internal communication and coordination, work planning, \nadaptive management, financial management, and reporting.  \n \n2.6. Progress to Impact Rating \n \n17. Progress to impact was considered Moderately Unsatisfactory. The project achieved a \nless than expected impact toward its stated intentions to enhance MRV capacity, \nimprove MRV systems, and strengthen institutional and policy coordination.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n2.7. Terminal Evaluation Summary Rating Table \n \n18. The overall rating for the project is Moderately Unsatisfactory. It has been noted that \nthe project encountered numerous difficulties throughout implementation relating to \ncoordination with third parties and alignment on project procedures. The project also \nhad an ambitious timeline for a relatively short duration. However, despite these \nnoted challenges the assessment identified significant shortcomings in the \neffectiveness of delivering outcomes and progress to impact. Importantly, access to \ndata and key outputs such as the inventory were lacking at the end of the project and \ntime of evaluation – thereby also limiting progress and sustainability beyond the \nproject end.  \n \nMonitoring & Evaluation \nRating \nImplementation & Execution \nRating \nM&E Design at Entry \nHS \nQuality of CI Implementation  \nS \nM&E Plan Implementation \nS \nQuality of Execution - Executing \nAgency  \nS \nOverall Quality of M&E \nS \nOverall Quality of Implementation / \nExecution  \nS \n \n \n \n \nAssessment of Outcomes \nRating \nSustainability \nRating \nRelevance \nHS \nFinancial Resources  \nMU \nEffectiveness \nMU \nSocio-political  \nML \nEfficiency \nS \nInstitutional Framework and \nGovernance \nMU \nOverall project outcome rating \nMS \nEnvironmental \nL \n \n \nOverall Likelihood of Sustainability \nMU \nImpact \nRating \nEnvironmental & Social Safeguards \nRating \nEnvironmental Status \nImprovement  \nNA \nDesign and Implementation of \nSafeguards  \nHS \nEnvironmental Stress \nReduction  \nNA \n \n \nProgress Toward Stress/Status \nChange  \nNA \n \n \nOverall project results \nMU \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n3. Evaluation Approach and methodology \n \n3.1. Objective of the Evaluation \n \n19. The purpose of the evaluation is to provide an independent external review of the \nprogress toward the project’s objective and expected outcomes, and to provide \nfeedback and recommendations to CI and project stakeholders that can help \nconsolidate project results and support the sustainability of the project after \ncompletion.  \n \n20. The objective of the terminal evaluation is to:  \n• Assess progress toward achievement of expected project objective and outcomes. \n• Identify and assess current risks to the success of the project. \n• Identify potential project design issues. \n• Identify and document lessons that can both improve the sustainability of benefits \nfrom this project and aid in the overall enhancement of CI and GEF programming.  \n• Make recommendations for any necessary measures to consolidate the results \nand support sustainability of the project.   \n \n21. The scope of the evaluation is outlined in the inception report and detailed \nmethodology (see Annex A) covers the following aspects, integrating the GEF’s \nOperational Principles, as appropriate. The scope integrates GEF’s operating \nprinciples and key focal areas of the project evaluation framework as follows:  \n• Project Theory-of-Change and Strategy  \no Project design  \no Results Framework/Logframe  \no Progress Towards Results  \no Progress Towards Outcomes Analysis  \no Impact and Global Environmental Benefits  \no Catalytic role: Replication and up-scaling  \n• Project Implementation and Adaptive Management  \no Management Arrangements  \no Work Planning  \no Finance and co-finance  \no Project-level Monitoring and Evaluation Systems  \no Stakeholder Engagement and Partnership Approach  \no Reporting  \no Communications  \n• Sustainability  \no Risks to durability of project impact including capacity building \no Financial risks to sustainability  \n \n\n \n \n12 \n22. The scope of the evaluation is as outlined in the inception report for the evaluation \nand defined in the following table consistent with the GEF Evaluation Criteria of \nrelevance, effectiveness, and efficiency (see Annex E).  \nTable: GEF Main Evaluation Criteria for GEF Projects  \nRelevance \n• \nThe extent to which the activity is suited to local and national development priorities \nand organizational policies, including changes over time.  \n• \nThe extent to which the project is in line with the GEF Operational Programs or \nstrategic priorities under which the project was funded.  \n• \nNote: retrospectively, the question of relevance often becomes a question as to \nwhether the objectives of an intervention or its design are still appropriate given \nchanged circumstances.  \nEffectiveness \n• The extent to which an objective has been achieved or how likely it will be achieved.  \nEfficiency \n• The extent to which results have been delivered with the least costly resources \npossible, also called: cost-effectiveness or efficacy.  \nResults \n• \nThe positive and negative, foreseen and unforeseen changes to and effects produced \nby a development intervention(s).  \n• \nIn GEF terms, results include direct project outputs, short to medium-term outcomes, \nand longer-term impact including global environmental benefits, replication effects, \nand other local effects.  \nSustainability \n• \nThe likely ability of an intervention to continue to deliver benefits for an extended \nperiod of time after completion, considering financial risks, socio-political risks, \ninstitutional framework and governance risks, environmental risks  \n• \nProjects need to be environmentally, as well as financially and socially sustainable.  \n \n3.2. Principles for Design and Execution of the Evaluation  \n \n23. The evaluation was conducted in accordance with the GEF M&E Policy, which includes \nthe following principles for evaluation: Credibility, Utility, Impartiality, Transparency, \nDisclosure, and Participation. The evaluators implemented an analytically rigorous \nmethodology and thorough investigation into project design, management, and \nimpact. The resulting evaluation provides evidence-based information that is credible, \n\n \n \n13 \nreliable, and useful. The evaluation followed a participatory and consultative \napproach ensuring close engagement with the project team.  \n \n \n3.3. Evaluation Approach and Data Collection Methods \n \n24. The evaluation commenced January 6, 2020, with the signing of the evaluation \ncontract. The desk review and data collection portion of the evaluation were \ncompleted January to March 2020. A one-week field mission in Nairobi, Kenya was \ncarried out in February 2020 during which the executing agencies and other key \nstakeholders were interviewed.  \n \n25. The evaluative evidence collected was based on two primary methodologies:  \n• Desk review of relevant documentation (a list of documents reviewed \nincluded as Annex F to this report)  \n• Semi-structured interviews \n• Key Informant Interviews \n \n26. As such, the TE process involved five main steps, some of which overlapped:  \n• Desk review of project documentation  \n• Organization and completion of key stakeholder interviews  \n• Analysis of data, follow-up to address any data gaps, and drafting of the \nevaluation report,  \n• Circulation of the draft evaluation to participants for additional feedback and \ninput  \n• Finalization of the evaluation report and follow-up with the project team and \nstakeholders  \n \n3.4. Limitations to the Evaluation \n \n27. For the CBIT Kenya project evaluation, we encountered limitations that impacted the \nevaluation. While all evaluations face constraints due to limited time, access, and \nresources to collect and analyze evidence, we also found gaining access to key \nGovernment stakeholders challenging, even during the in-country field visit. Outreach \nto these stakeholders to facilitate interviews and data collection prior to the field visit \ncould have been improved by the executing agency by, for example, sending advance \nrequests for interviews, coordinating meeting times, assisting in persuading \nstakeholders to participate in the evaluation to gain more involvement.  Likewise, \nimproving logistical support with accurate directions and timing would allow the \nevaluation to be more efficient. In terms of document collection and desk research, \nthe CI project team provided all requested information and data for the evaluation \ndata collection process.  \n \n28. Wherever possible the evaluation has tried to draw on multiple data sources to \ntriangulate findings.  \n\n \n \n14 \n \n29. Altogether the evaluation challenges were manageable, and the evaluation is believed \nto represent a fair and accurate assessment of the project.  \n \n4. Theory of Change \n \n30. There was no explicit Theory of Change established for the project. The central aim \nwas to build capacity in Kenya to enable transparent and effective reporting \nconsistent with the Paris Climate Change Agreement.  \n \n31. For the purposes of the evaluation we established an implicit Theory of Change that \n“investment in capacity building, built capacity for GHG data collection and \nstrengthened  inter-agency coordination would improve decision making and \nreporting to meet transparency requirements of the Paris Climate Agreement.”  \n \n32. During terminal evaluation, CI-Kenya team prepared a Theory of Change as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n33. The Objective of the CBIT-Kenya Project was to enhance the SLEEK institutions in \nKenya to ensure Compliance with the Paris Agreement Transparency Requirements. \nThis objective would be achieved through 3 major activities: (a) Building in-country \ntechnical capacity (e.g., trainings) to develop and operate a Green House Gas \nInventory (GHGI) and MRV system; (b) Strengthening institutional arrangements for \n\n \n \n15 \nGHG data sharing amongst key institutions from the primary IPCC GHG sectors \nthrough signing of data sharing agreements; (c) Strengthening institutional capacity of \nthe CCD via provision of equipment for the GHGI.  \n \n34. It was anticipated that implementation of the activities above would yield the \nfollowing outcomes: (1.1) Strengthened institutional arrangements for GHG data \ncollection and sharing, quality control and assurance, analysis, and archiving \nstrengthened in all the 6 IPCC emission sectors; (1.2) Strengthened technical and \ninstitutional capacities of government institutions and staff to collect, document, and \narchive key GHG data in all sectors on a regular basis for the GHG inventory process; \n(1.3) Establishment of a functional GHGI  and MRV system at CCD, with climate data \nand analysis integrated into policy making, NDC tracking and international reporting; \n(2.1) Strengthened institutional arrangements for GHG data collection and sharing, \nquality control and assurance, analysis, and archiving strengthened for the land-based \nsector; (3.1) Establishment of a functional Coordination platform for all transparency-\nrelated activities and other reporting. Overtime, these outcomes will contribute \ntowards elimination of the following barriers to transparency: \n \n1. Inaccessibility of key Green House Gas (GHG) data for decision-making: In \nassessing national emissions in the various sectors, the GoK relies on data from \nvarious institutions including ministries, public and private sector and civil society \norganizations. This data, however, is either not available, not of the correct \nquality, incomplete or does not flow systematically because some institutional \npolicies and practices make data sharing difficult. \n2. Weak institutional capacities on MRV at all levels: The GoK staff at both national \nand county levels have limited capacities to develop and implement a robust MRV \nsystem. The GHG data collection for the AFOLU sector is particularly weak in \nKenya. \n3. Fragmented policy framework and institutional capacity: many sectoral policies \nand laws governing the environment sector in Kenya are not aligned. These \ninclude policies and laws in agriculture, land, water, forests, trade, and industry.   \n4. Lack of government investment on training and capacity building forums: The GoK \nlacked funds to allocate towards the development of and capacity building on \nMRV systems. This led to inadequate or poor-quality data in many sectors of the \neconomy, including those that are climate sensitive. \n \n35. The section below describes the link between the CBIT-Kenya project activities, \noutcomes and how they will contribute towards addressing barriers to transparency \nin Kenya and achieve the overall Goal of CBIT over-time: \n \nIt is anticipated that overtime, Barriers #1 and #2 above will be addressed if the \ncountry has built in-county technical capacity to collect quality GHG data, document, \nand archive key data. Outcomes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 will ensure continuous collection and \navailability of up-to-date quality GHG data across all the IPCC emission sectors hence \ncases of limited or no GHG data will be eradicated. Subsequently, incountry capacity \nto develop and operationalise the GHGI and MRV system will ensure Kenya \n\n \n \n16 \nconsistently prepares and submits required reports such as NCs and BURs to the \nUNFCCC. In-addition, in-country technical capacity to consistently collect, analyse and \ndocument quality GHG data coupled with strengthened institutional  arrangements \nfor GHG data collection and sharing amongst key institutions  from the 6 IPCC GHG \nemission sectors will ensure continued flow and sharing of data. As a result, Kenya will \nbe able to constantly track progress made towards achieving its NDC and will be able \nto clearly identify additional support required to reach Tier 3 reporting and fulfil the \nenhanced transparency requirements defined in Article 13 of the Paris Agreement. \n \nOvertime, outcomes of the CBIT project through outcomes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1 and 3.1 \nwill address Barrier #3. Improved coordination and strengthened institutional \narrangements for GHG data collection, sharing, quality control and assurance, \nanalysis, and archiving amongst key institutions from the 6 IPCC emission sectors will \nresult to alignment of Kenya’s environmental legislation and formulation of climate \nproof policy frameworks in the long-run. Overtime, constant and transparent sharing \nof GHG data and other relevant information amongst the institutions from the 6 IPCC \nemission sectors (which are party to the GHG data sharing agreements) will enable \nthem to work together during formulation of policies. Notably, all these institutions \nwill have access to up-to-date reports detailing the status of Kenya’s GHG emissions \nand sinks. The reports will guide these institutions to make informed decisions on \nnational development planning and how best to partner to establish and execute \nclimate sensitive activities and/or policies in-order to transition the country towards a \nlow-carbon pathway. Climate sensitive legislative frameworks create an enabling \nenvironment for attracting and accessing climate finance. Access to climate finance \nwill promote implementation of climate transparency initiatives amongst other \ninitiatives hence steer the country towards fulfilling its NDC and fulfil its commitment \nto meet the enhanced transparency requirements defined in Article 13 of the Paris \nAgreement \n \nOvertime, outcomes 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1 and 3.1 will address Barriers #3 and #4. Funds \nallocated to the CBIT Kenya Project will enable Kenya to establish a GHGI and MRV \nSystem whilst strengthening institutional and technical capacity of staff to collect, \ndocument, and archive key data in all sectors on a regular basis for the GHG \ninventory.  Findings from Kenya’s Climate Public Expenditure and Budget Review \n(CPEBR) show that Kenya can enhance access to climate finance by ensuring climate \nchange considerations are incorporated in budgeting, planning and finance processes \nat National and County level (UNDP, 2016). The reports generated by compiling the \nGHGI are a basis for decision makers to justify why climate sensitive activities should \nbe included in national planning and budgeting. In-addition, the GHGI reports can be \nused to mobilise external funding for climate adaption and mitigation initiatives which \nwill enable the country work towards implementing activities in the NDC and fulfil its \ncommitment to meet the enhanced transparency requirements defined in Article 13 \nof the Paris Agreement. \n \n\n \n \n17 \nOBJECTIVE OF \nTHE CBIT KENYA \nPROJECT \nSTRATEGIES \nIf we do the following… \nEVIDENCE OF \nIMPROVEMENT  \n…then we will see \nthese changes  \nINTENDED IMPACTS \nthereby causing these impacts \nTo enhance the \nSLEEK system in \nKenya to ensure \nCompliance with \nthe Paris \nAgreement \nTransparency \nRequirements. \n \n \n \nOUTCOMES PER \nCOMPONENT \n1.1 Strengthen \ninstitutional \narrangements for \nGHG data \ncollection and \nsharing, quality \ncontrol and \nassurance, analysis, \nand archiving \nstrengthened in all \nthe 6 IPCC \nemission sectors.  \n1.2 Strengthen \ntechnical and \ninstitutional \ncapacities of \ngovernment \ninstitutions and \nstaff to collect, \ndocument, and \narchive key GHG \ndata in all sectors \non a regular basis \nfor the GHG \ninventory process.  \n1.3 Establish a \nfunctional GHGI \nand MRV system at \nCCD, with climate \ndata and analysis \nintegrated into \npolicy making, NDC \ntracking and \ninternational \nreporting;  \n2.1 Strengthen \ninstitutional \narrangements for \nGHG data \ncollection and \nsharing, quality \ncontrol and \nassurance, analysis, \nand archiving \nstrengthened for \nthe land-based \nsector. \n1.1 Establish a \nfunctional \nCoordination \nplatform for all \ntransparency-\n1. \nGHGI developed \nand \noperationalized \nby in-country \npersonnel –  \n2. \nIncountry \npersonnel trained \nby the CBIT \nProject have the \ncapacity to \ndevelop and \noperationalise \nthe GHGI and \nMRV System  \n3. \nGHG data sharing \namongst the \ninstitutions from \nthe IPCC emission \nsectors \n4. \nCCD playing an \nactive role in \ncoordinating GHG \ndata sharing \namongst the \ninstitutions from \nthe IPCC emission \nsectors \n5. \nKenya using \nincountry \nexpertise to \nprepare reports \nsubmitted to the \nUNFCCC e.g., \nBURs, NCs \n6. \nKenya fulfilling its \ninternational \nreporting \nobligation e.g., \nconsistent \nreporting to \nUNFCCC  \nLINKAGE WITH THE GEF CBIT \nGOAL \n \nNear Term Impact (<10 years) \n1. \nKenya tracking progress of its \nNDC – the functional GHGI \nsupporting this process \n2. \nKenya using incountry \nexpertise to prepare reports \nsubmitted to the UNFCCC \ne.g., BURs, NCs \n3. \nGHGI reports supporting \ndecision making in Kenya  \n4. \nGHG data sharing amongst \nthe institutions from the IPCC \nemission sectors \n5. \nCCD playing an active role in \ncoordinating GHG data \nsharing  \n6. \nKenya fulfils its international \nreporting obligation e.g., \nconsistent reporting to \nUNFCCC \n7. \nKenya identifies further \nsupport required to realize \nArticle 13 of the Paris \nAgreement  \n \nLong-Term Impact (>10 Years) \n1. \nGHGI and MRV system fully \nfunctional which enables \nKenya to reach Tier 3 \nreporting  \n2. \nQuality, updated GHG data \naccessible to all stakeholders \n3. \nExisting in-country technical \ncapacity to collect up-to-date \nquality GHG data and feed \ninto the GHGI \n4. \nFunctional Institutional \narrangements for GHG data \nsharing  \n5. \nAligned cross sectoral of \nenvironmental policy \nframeworks  \n6. \nIncreased access to climate \nfinance (especially funding for \ntransparency activities) \nLINKAGE WITH \nARTICLE 13 OF \nTHE PARIS \nAGREEMENT. \nStrengthened \nnational \ninstitutions for \ntransparency-\nrelated \nactivities in line \nwith national \npriorities and \nimproved \ntransparency \nover time \nwhich results to \nfulfilment of \nthe enhanced \ntransparency \nrequirements \ndefined in \nArticle 13 of \nthe Paris \nAgreement. \n\n \n \n18 \nOBJECTIVE OF \nTHE CBIT KENYA \nPROJECT \nSTRATEGIES \nIf we do the following… \nEVIDENCE OF \nIMPROVEMENT  \n…then we will see \nthese changes  \nINTENDED IMPACTS \nthereby causing these impacts \nrelated activities \nand other \nreporting. \n36. This Theory of Change, therefore, provides a useful context for the assessment of \nproject results as summarized in the following sections. Each project outcome and \ncomponent is evaluated in the context of the progress to impact and furtherance of \nthe project Theory of Change. \n \n37. However, it is also recognized that time scales for impact must be taken into \nconsideration. Specifically, institutional capacity building requires a long-term scale \nwith consistent and sustained investment. It can be difficult to fully evaluate the long-\nterm benefits to institutional capacity building resulting from training activities of \nspecific individuals. This evaluation incorporates these considerations to evaluate the \neffectiveness and efficiency of project activities towards the intended impact and \noverall Theory of Change. \n \n5. Assessment of Project Progress to Impact \n \n38. The GEF Evaluation Office requires a rating on project impact. Overall, the project \nprogress to impact is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory. Firstly, it is necessary to \nnote that the project was not intended to fully achieve the goal of enabling \ncompliance with the Paris Agreement in the lifetime of the project. The project’s \nstated intentions were to enhance capacity to enhance MRV capacity, improve MRV \nsystems, and strengthen institutional and policy coordination. However, based on the \nproject implicit Theory of Change and the stated objectives, we can assess how \nsignificant project contributions have been or will be toward achieving that goal in the \nfuture. Thus, to assess the Progress to Impact we revert to reviewing the questions \nposed above as follows:  \n \n39. Data accessibility: Did the project activities contribute significantly to improve access \nto data?  \n• At the time of the evaluation, according to multiple stakeholders, data \nremained inaccessible to various project participants and was not being used \nfor analysis, policy formulation, or decision making.  Inaccessibility appears to \nbe a result of institutional licensing arrangements with regard to data and \nsoftware. \n \n40. MRV capacity: Do the stakeholder agencies now have significantly improved capacity \nto conduct MRV activities?  \n\n \n \n19 \n• At the time of the evaluation, given the inaccessibility of data, it was difficult \nto assess whether or not stakeholder agencies had retained or were utilising \nthe MRV capacity resulting from the project or that project activities had \nsignificantly enhanced this capacity. \n \n41. Policy framework: Is the policy framework significantly less fragmented and providing \na more cohesive and aligned approach to relevant environmental policies? \n• The project did establish important arrangements for data sharing and \ncollaboration, which are critical for any sustained progress toward impact. \nThese accomplishments enable a more cohesive policy framework for MRV \nand other required activities to comply with the Paris Agreement. Beyond \nthese achievements, it is unclear how the project made significant \ncontributions to enhancing and enabling a more coordinated policy \nframework. There are other concurrent projects related to the CBIT project’s \ngoals so it is difficult assign attribution. At the time of the evaluation, we did \nnot find evidence of the project’s tangible contributions to a more cohesive \npolicy framework beyond those mentioned above. \n \n42. Government investment: Are government agencies now investing more resources \ninto capacity building and MRV systems?  \n• The timeframe to answer this question is difficult to determine. It should be \nrecognized that the time scale for the Government to mobilize resources and \nimplement programs to investment in capacity building is likely to be longer \nthan the six months from the end of the project to the time of the evaluation. \nIt may very well be that the Government will increase investment in this area \nin part due to the CBIT project and this would not be surprising given the high \npriority of the objective, involvement of various agencies in the project, and \nthe evident need for enhanced capacity. However, at the time of the \nevaluation we did not find evidence that the Government had mobilized \nresources to continue progress from the project.  \n \n43. Part of the scope of the evaluation included an assessment of the extent to which GEF \npromoted approaches, technologies, financing instruments, legal frameworks, \ninformation systems, etc., that were adopted/implemented without direct support \nfrom, or involvement of, the project. At the time of the evaluation, and through \nconsultation with various project participants and stakeholder organizations, we did \nnot find evidence that any such adoption had taken place.  \n \n44. We also sought to assess the arrangements in the project design to facilitate follow-\nup actions related to the projects outputs and intended overall objectives. Our review \nof the initial project document (Prodoc) did not identify any such arrangements. At \nthe time of the evaluation there were no evident arrangements, nor have actions \nrecently undertaken that would facilitate follow-up.   \n \n45. There may indeed be valid alternative interpretations and assessments of the \nproject’s progress to impact. We would anticipate that such differing views would be \n\n \n \n20 \nfounded on either a different interpretation of the project’s Theory of Change or, as \nstated above, a different timescale for assessment. Regarding timescale, as noted \nabove we acknowledge it is difficult to assess the progress to medium or long-term \nimpact at this time. Regarding the Theory of Change, we have anchored the Theory of \nChange and assessment of the related progress to impact in statements provided by \nthe project management in documentation including the Prodoc and PIR. However, as \nstated, there was no explicit theory of change for the project, so this remains open to \nsubjective interpretation.  \n \n \n6. Assessment of Project Results \n \n46. Project Objective: The overall stated project objective was to enhance the SLEEK \nsystem in Kenya to ensure Compliance with the Paris Agreement Transparency \nRequirements.  Section 6 provides an overview; subsequent section provide further \nexplanation for the various elements.  \n \nOverall Rating: (6 point scale; from highly unsatisfactory to highly satisfactory; see Annex E) \nRating \nMS \n \nThe overall rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory. Firstly, the evaluation \nidentified evidence that the SLEEK system had been enhanced but the fact that the system \nwas not operational at the end of the project represented a shortcoming. Secondly, the \nevaluation found that despite conducting trainings with a large number of participants, the \ninvestments in capacity building for MRV had limited impact and sustainability, mainly \nbecause government staff had been subsequently reassigned to different positions within \nthe civil service. Therefore, progress toward ensuring compliance with the Paris Agreement \nwas limited. Thirdly, however, the project did accomplish several notable improvements to \ninstitutional coordination and related policy development - both commendable and critical \nprogress to establishing the foundational environment for effective compliance. \n \nOverview:  \n47. A key part of the project as agreed between CI and Government of Kenya was to \nfocus on the production of the inventory as an output of the project. The Kenya CBIT \nproject built on the earlier work of projects to fully implement the MRV system for \nthe five (5) sectors (Agriculture, Energy, Waste, Forests, and Transport), such as SLEEK \nand the Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development (LECRD) project, funded by \nUSAID through UNDP. The institutional arrangements, technical capacity, \ncoordination mechanisms and data access, ownership and analysis were identified as \nbarriers to the operationalization of MRV. \n \n48. CBIT looked to address these barriers during project implementation. Interviews with \nstakeholders indicate that the project achieved its objectives regarding Component 1. \nCCD as the lead executing agency from the GoK acknowledged the contribution of the \nCBIT project to the production of the national inventory and MRV reporting. They also \nrecognised the project’s contributions towards calculations of emissions using the \n\n \n \n21 \nIPCC tools and the movement of some of the sectoral data systems from Tier 1 to Tier \n2. There is increased data quality and access, coordination amongst government \nagencies has been improved, the quality of reporting from the five sectors has \nimproved – the project supported the production of a forest land cover map – and \nthe capacity now exists for the production of an inventory. Before the project, the \ninventory process had been driven by external consultants with very little Kenyan \ninput or knowledge. This work can now all be done in-country and there is ownership \nof the process by the GoK.  \n \n49. At baseline, there was no usable data for estimation of emission levels, there was very \nlittle coordination and sharing of data between government agencies – information \nmanagement was done in silos. The project had success in increasing coordination \namong agencies and improving information sharing and coordination. All stakeholders \nagree that this is one of the greatest outputs of the project. The work of the \nGreenhouse Gas Management Institute (GHG MI) was greatly appreciated by all \nstakeholders. \n \n50. Coordination between agencies and sectors is much better and was attributed by the \nstakeholders to the project–government officials from emission-sector institutions \nare enthusiastic about the continuation of the project gains, given that the GoK is \ncrafting development plans that will require accurate and reliable emissions data. \n \n51. The system is however operating below optimal levels. It cannot yet meet the \ntransparency requirements required by the Paris agreement due to several factors – \nnetworking, institutional arrangements, and management. \n \n52. The fact that the platform is not fully functional has limited the ability of the various \nbodies involved in GHG inventory – CSOs, GoK agencies, universities, and private \nsector – to network in terms of data collection, processing, and reporting. CCD acts as \nthe collation agency where data is aggregated but the platform was meant to serve as \na mechanism for the sharing and interpretation of data across sectors, acting as a \ncooperation framework.  \n \n53. There is insufficient institutional coordination between CCD and the sector hubs as \nwell as the MRV stakeholders. Much of this can be traced to the fact that the capacity \nbuilding within the CCD did not achieve its goal of enabling it to coordinate activities \nacross institutions. Staffing of the office and harmonization of the work being \nundertaken by the various organizations involved in GHG activities will improve \ntransparency.  \n \n54. Better understanding and harmonizing of these activities and stakeholders will help \navoid duplication and result in improved transparency.  \n \n55. Stakeholders all agreed that more still needs to be done to sustain the gains of the \nproject – staff attrition in the government sector means that many beneficiaries of \nthe capacity building activities are either not in place or have transferred to \n\n \n \n22 \ndepartments not directly involved in climate change activities, MoUs signed through \nthe project are not necessarily being followed, and sectoral activities are not being \ncoordinated as well as expected. \n \n56. Meetings with stakeholders conducted for this evaluation revealed that the \nformulation of this project did not happen in “a straight line”. Between the concept of \nthe project, the original Project Identification Form (PIF), and the final project \ndocument approved by GEF, the design of the project went through a few iterations. \nAlong these steps, the formulation of the project strategy evolved to end up with a \nsharper focus on supporting the GoK in the production of a national inventory report. \n \n57. The decision was made to de-emphasise the enhancement of SLEEK in favour of \nproducing the report. This decision was taken with the full participation and \nagreement of the government agencies involved in the project. It was felt that the \nSLEEK project had produced outputs which were intangible and there was a desire to \nsee something more concrete emerge as output of this project, as opposed to further \ncapacity building, the results of which are difficult to quantify. \n \n58. In addition, the GoK had recently enacted policies that are dependent on the \navailability of accurate and reliable data for emissions estimations. This ensured the \nimmediacy of the project’s objectives and further pushed the focus towards the \nproduction of emission numbers. \n \n59. All stakeholders and partners interviewed by the evaluation team found that the time \nand resources were insufficient to achieve the planned outcomes of the project. \nLikewise, the duration of the project was not realistic. Most stakeholders interviewed \nestimated a minimum of 3 years of continued work before signs of impact across MRV \nreporting could be measured. Compounding the issue of the lack of time was the fact \nthat the project started late due to several factors. The project manager was \nrecruited after the project started and there were delays in funds being transferred. \nThis delay appears to have impacted the project timeline and project management \nprocesses were not implemented on time. A no-cost extension was provided by CI-\nGEF in coordination with the Government of Kenya. However, the delays in project \nactivities meant that the objectives could not be fully achieved, especially regarding \ncomponent 3. The online platform was built with data compiled, however, due to \naccess rights it was not operational at the end of the project or at the time of the \nevaluation.  \n \n60. Project execution was also affected by the composition of the project management \nteam. There was only one person responsible for project management, \nadministration, monitoring and reporting. This created a workload that led to delays \nand interruptions. The integration of CI’s financial mechanisms with those of the \npartners and stakeholders also contributed to project delays. There was \nmisunderstanding, especially among government agencies, of the processes required \nto ensure the timely transfer of funds. CI funding was also restricted and could not be \nused to pay the allowances requested by stakeholders for government workers who \n\n \n \n23 \nattended trainings. These allowances had been mandated by the permanent \nsecretary of the Kenyan civil service and was therefore, SOP of GoK. This problem was \nonly resolved when stakeholders developed an agreement to provide payments to \nthe government officials participating in the project. It is doubtful that there would \nhave been any outputs to report on if this issue had not been resolved. \n \n61. According to the government stakeholders, the project contained some design flaws. \nA major flaw was a misunderstanding of the hiring practices of the government of \nKenya. This meant that the CCD could not retain the staff that were hired by CI. The \nGovernment also wanted to second people to the project without following CI’s \nprocurement process. As a result, most of the people who were being proposed by \nthe Government ended up not meeting the criteria as required by CI. The office is still \nunoccupied, the interns hired by CI could not be retained as their hiring process did \nnot follow the normal GoK protocols. While this may have been the intent of the \nproject activities, the approach did not yield the overall objective of sustainable \ncapacity building.  \n \n62. Given the tangible results of the project, most of the partners interviewed report \nsatisfaction given the activities carried out with available time and resources. They \nexpressed the view that the CBIT project should serve as a preparatory phase of a \nlarger and longer program allowing partners to focus on the gains of the project. They \nindicated that partners are now better coordinated and have a better understanding \nof the needs for the preparation of an emissions inventory.  \n \n63. The levels of reporting are different across the sectors, but the data quality has \nmoved from Tier 1 to Tier 2. However, partners felt that with the cessation of \nactivities with project closure, most efforts are likely to be lost in the medium term. \nThe evaluation team identified a risk of fulfilling near-term outputs – registry, \ninventory – due to an unclear strategy for how uptake of the capacity building \ninitiatives will produce a long-term impact and an unclear exit plan. For example, the \nGovernment has reduced staffing at the CCD with only 2 people able to work \nadequately with the data required for MRV reporting. This means that the collation \nand management of emissions data can be easily compromised. \nRelevance:  \n64. Overall, the evaluation found the project relevance to be Highly Satisfactory. \nSignatories to the Paris Agreement are expected to have submitted Nationally \nDetermined Contributions (NDCs) which represent the national plans and pledges \nmade to meet the universal goal of keeping global temperature increases to below \n2oC above pre-industrial levels.  \n \n65. A key result of the Paris Agreement negotiations was the establishment of an \nenhanced transparency framework for tracking and reporting the progress of existing \nand future country commitments. CBIT was created to help strengthen the \ninstitutional and technical capacities of non-Annex I countries to meet the enhanced \ntransparency requirements defined in Article 13 of the Paris Agreement. \n\n \n \n24 \n \n66. All sources of information (documents and interviews) confirmed that Kenya’s ability \nto fulfil its obligations under the Paris Agreement was limited prior to the CBIT \nproject. The project’s objectives were thus fully consistent with international \nobjectives for improving GHG estimations and meeting the obligations of the Paris \nAgreement. \n \n67. Its timing was excellent; it provided the government with additional resources to \nstrengthen its MRV system. From a timing point of view, the CBIT project was also \nhighly relevant. It was designed during the strategic planning period of the GoK when \nnational development priorities are being determined. With climate change \nadaptation and the effects on the economy being given priority by the government in \ntheir planning period. There are policy decisions that will be dependent on the \navailability of quality GHG data and information. Thus, all stakeholders considered \nthat the project was necessary both from a technical and political point of view.  \n \n68. The project was formulated based on a contextual review which provided the \nnecessary background studies for the formulation of the project. The final project \nconcept emerged from national priorities, which were identified during the \nconsultation stage. The participative process to design and implement the project \nalso contributed to a strong stakeholder ownership and made this project more \nrelevant. The result was the design of a project that was a direct response to national \nprioritized needs. The government is in the process of applying for development \nfunding from donor agencies. Once such funding secured it is anticipated the limited \nof mobilization identified in the evaluation will have been addressed. \n \n69. The GoK has been seeking to develop an MRV reporting system. GHG emissions and \nreporting was an activity that was outsourced to foreign consultants. The capacity of \nKenya to produce MRV reporting was limited by two critical barriers: the accessibility \nand validity of data, and the lack of human capacity and institutional arrangements to \nensure the management of the system. \n \n70. The project was designed to address these barriers; hence it is fully relevant for \nimproving the management of the MRV reporting in Kenya. \n \n71. The terminal evaluation of the relevance of each component is provided below. \n \nEffectiveness:  \n72. Overall, the evaluation found the project effectiveness Moderately Satisfactory. The \nCBIT project delivered results across each of the three components. The assessment \nof project effectiveness (delivery of results at the outcome level) is based on the level \nof attainment of objectives and planned results by examining the achievement of the \noutcomes using the logframe (revised) indicators as well as the analysis of the \nlikelihood of impact using the review of outcomes to impact. \n \n\n \n \n25 \n73. The terminal evaluation of the effectiveness of each component is provided below. \n \nEfficiency:  \n \n74. Overall, the evaluation found the project effectiveness Moderately Satisfactory. In \nreviewing the management and partnership agreements entered by the project, the \nevaluation team observed that the collaborations entered into with the key \nstakeholders were arrived at after a participatory process. However, project \nmanagement and institutional policies clashed between CI and stakeholders. This \nimpacted the effectiveness of the project as there were problems with the integration \nof management systems which caused some delays in the delivery of project \nactivities. In future projects it is advisable to strengthen communication and \nagreement of such policies at project inception if not prior. \n \n75. Most of the stakeholders interviewed believed the financial management systems of \nCI were not conducive for effective work. There were delays in fund transfers, \nmisunderstanding of the systems for disbursement of funds, and the allocation of \nproject resources. While such difficulties are not uncommon for similar projects the \nprevalence of these difficulties appeared higher than would be expected. As noted in \nthe recommendations this is an area for consideration for future investments. \n \n76. The project implementation started after the signing of the partnership agreements, \nand the agreements of MOUs and despite difficulties due to factors both within and \noutside the project’s control. The project was not always able to respond to the \nchanging needs of the partners and the management structures did not contribute \neffectively to project implementation. The main difficulties included: (i) human \nresources constraint: the project implementation team for a project this size requires \nmore staff to ensure proper management of the project, (ii) time consuming \nprocurement processes; CI internal administrative hurdles, and (iii) GHG data \navailability and access. Financial information indicated that despite delays in funds \ntransfers, project funds were properly allocated to their expected allotment areas.  \n \nThe burden of organizing the workshops proved to be even higher than expected. \nThis together with the previously mentioned difficulties required considerable effort \nto cover the required technical and administrative support with the staff constraints.  \n \n77. The terminal evaluation of the efficiency of each component is provided below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n26 \n \n6.1. Project Outcomes  \n \nComponent 1: Strengthening national institutions and capacities in Kenya to enhance MRV \ntransparency in line with Kenya’s national priorities.  \n \nOverall Rating \nMS \n \nRelevance  \nS \n \nThe project capacity building outcomes were congruent with the GEF focal areas and \noperating strategies. The outcomes were also consistent with national strategies and the \nrequirements of the Paris Agreement.  \nEffectiveness \nMS \n \nThe project investments in institutional arrangements for GHG data sharing were adequate \nto achieve project outcomes. Training activities for capacity building outcomes, however, \nwere not commensurate with the intended goals and did not make significant progress \ntoward impact as discussed in subsequent section of this report. While many individuals \nparticipated in training, these activities appear to have been ineffective in enhancing \noverall capacity as evidenced by the lack of retained staff and lack of continued progress \nbeyond the end of the project. At the time of the evaluation, the capacity had not been \nmaintained or sustained by stakeholder agencies. In terms of data collection and \nincorporation, these actions were not commensurate with intended impact. During the \nevaluation, stakeholders were unable to access significant parts of MRV data and share \nthem with the evaluators due to licensing and technical constraints. Further several \nstakeholders expressed grave concerns about the data quality and utility for decision \nmaking. Lastly, the intended web platform was not operationalized nor was the GHG \ninventory and MRV system completed by the end of the project, nor was there evidence \nthat such data was being used to inform policy making.  With respect to the Theory of \nChange and intended impact, it is not evident that the project contributed significantly to \nenhanced MRV capacity. \nEfficiency \nMS \n \nThe project was cost effective overall in terms of conducting the planned activities. The \nproject did experience significant delays in the early phases to establish coordination and \ncommunication with relevant stakeholder organizations including government agencies (eg \nLECRD, ICAT). However, this type of delay is relatively common and cannot be attributed \nsolely to any inefficiency of project management. In terms of capacity building, the project \ndid accomplish training activities involving over 300 individuals. However, we would expect \ncommensurate investments to yield more robust and sustained technical capacity in line \nwith other relevant projects. The limited impact appears to have been due to the design of \ntechnical training and difficulty organizing large workshops with effective impact, \ndifficulties in gaining participation, or other factors including those beyond the control of \nproject management.    \n \n \n \n\n \n \n27 \n \n \nOutcome \nStatus \n \nOutcome 1.1: Institutional arrangements for data collection \nand sharing, quality control and assurance, analysis and \narchiving will be strengthened in all the 6 IPCCC sectors and 47 \ncounties. \n \nProject Target: Established and institutionalized formal \narrangements for data collection, sharing, analysis and \nreporting with a functional national GHG inventory and MRV \nsystems in place. This includes the mitigation and adaptation \nsectors. The arrangements are to be coordinated by the \nClimate Change Directorate. \n \nProject results: Data collection, sharing and analysing \nmechanisms have been established. The institutionalization of \nthe system, however, remains incomplete at CCD level. Uptake \nat sector level has been strong. \n  \n \nS \n \nOutcome 1.2: Through targeted training, capacity of \nstakeholders (in 6 sectors and 47 counties) will be built on data \ncollection and processing protocols and tools for GHG inventory \npreparation, forecasting and management. \n \nProject Target: 100 field data staff from public and private \nsectors, and civil society trained on GHG inventory estimation, \ndata collection, forecasting and data management, and the \ntrained staff can apply the knowledge at central and county \ngovernments and their own individual institutional levels. \n \nProject Results: Capacity has been built. Less than a hundred \n(~75) were trained and there was a high turnover rate of \ngovernment staff. It is our understanding that the Government \nis putting in place measures to mitigate this such as career \ndevelopment programs and consideration of salary revisions. \n \n \nMS \n \nOutcome 1.3: A functional GHG inventory and MRV system for \nNDC tracking and reporting in place, with climate data and two \nclimate action registries, with the objective of integration into \npolicy making as well. \n \n \nMS \n\n \n \n28 \nProject Target: Functional GHG and MRV systems established in \nthe CCD with climate data and analysis integrated into policy \nmaking, NDC tracking and international reporting. \n \nProject Results: Moderately satisfactory. The CCD was not \nfunctional or operative in its role of coordinating activities \nbeyond the project. CCD collating and analysing data. \nFunctional GHG Inventory and MRV system established at \nsectoral levels. \n \n \nOutcome 4: Public climate expenditure included in the MRV \nsystem for NDC tracking. \n \n \nThis activity was removed \nas it was being \nimplemented by an \nongoing project tracking \npublic expenditure. \n \n \n78. Component 2: Supporting enhancements to the System for Land-Based Emission \nEstimation in Kenya (SLEEK) to assist with improvement of transparency over time.  \n \nOverall Rating \nMU \n \nRelevance  \nS \n \nThe long-term need for the SLEEK system at a national level is considered essential. The \nproject concept emerged from national priorities, such as an alternative institutional \nframework for managing emissions data. Government of Kenya has been seeking an \nefficient, effective and accountable institutional framework for the administration and \nmanagement of GHG and MRV issues and SLEEK is considered a vital component of this \nframework. Project activities related to GHG data sharing arrangements across agencies \nfor the GHG Inventory and MRV systems were consistent with project goals. However, as \nexplained above, the project objective was changed. The only work done to enhance SLEEK \nwas related to capacity building to manage the system.  \nEffectiveness \nMU \n \nThere appears to have been a systemic failure in the project to deliver on this component \nin a meaningful way. Data identification, quality and accuracy has been improved however \nnot to the level anticipated and several concerns were received from stakeholders during \nthe evaluation. The SLEEK system is housed within the Ministry of Environment however it \nis not yet fully operational as capacity still needs to be built for data management and \nanalysis. Online platform has not been fully established. There were significant delays in \nprogram implementation due to project and financial management as explained in sections \n67-69 above.  The training conducted in the Netherlands and Australia appear to have \ncontributed relatively little toward the overall intended impact. While broadly consistent \nwith the project goals, it is questionable whether these training activities were the most \nrelevant contributions as they impacted relatively few people and there was difficulty \nretaining these individuals in ongoing related activities. Given that the goal was to support \n\n \n \n29 \nenhancements to the system, the evaluation concluded that progress in data collection \nand incorporation activities under this component were limited. At the time of the \nevaluation there was no evidence that significant contributions had been made to \nenhancing SLEEK. The capacity building investments had occurred, but the individuals \ninvolved had not contributed significantly to enhancing SLEEK in terms of data or system \nimprovements and were no longer engaged in these activities due to changes in staffing \nand human resource constraints. Furthermore, at the time of the evaluation, it was not \npossible to obtain access to significant parts of the data by either the evaluators or key \nstakeholders involved in the project. Several project participants complained of the lack of \naccess and availability of data generated by the project. With respect to the Theory of \nChange and intended impact, it is not evident that data accessibility and MRV have been \nimproved to a level commensurate with the project’s original objectives.  \nEfficiency \nMU \n \nThe project, from a procurement standpoint, was efficient in its investments. However, as \nstated above, these investments yielded limited contribution toward the intended goals \nand impact.  The evaluation also encountered widespread confusion and concern about \nactivities and results related to this project component. Several project stakeholders \nthemselves could not explain the results in terms of enhancements to SLEEK. As compared \nto other similar projects we could have expected a greater degree of understanding, \ntangible improvements to the SLEEK data model and analytical system, and greater access \nto data resources related to and resulting from the project.  \n \nOutcome \nStatus \n \nOutcome 2.1 Enhance the existing institutions and \narrangements among SLEEK data-contributing organisations for \nland sector data exchange and coordination, including the \nREDD+ activities, with CCD. \n \nProject Target: All the 6 EWGs teams established under SLEEK \nstrengthened with formal established arrangements to provide \ndata and information for the land-based GHG emission \nestimation to CCD for the national GHG inventory and MRV \nsystems in accordance with requirements specified by the CCD. \n \nProject Results: EWGs were strengthened. Arrangements \nestablished. Training on management of SLEEK system \nprovided. However, the inability to access and utilise key data, \nlack of common understanding of the data and quality concerns \nby stakeholders, is deeply concerning.  \n \n \nMU \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n30 \n \n79. Component 3: Supporting the enhancement of the coordination between national, \nregional, and global transparency related activities in Kenya.  \n \nOverall Rating \nMS \n \nRelevance  \nS \n \nProject activities related to this component were consistent with the project goals. The \nactivities were also consistent with Government policy and the broader requirements of \nthe Paris Agreement. Specifically, the project’s role in bridging communication across \nvarious agencies and facilitating the Government Climate Change Directorate in engaging \nin multi-stakeholder engagement was highly relevant and was needed to achieve progress.  \nEffectiveness \nMS \n \nThe project established arrangements for, and conducted specific events and activities that \ncontributed to, enhancing communication and coordination. The project forged \npartnership with key agencies (eg LECRD, ICAT).  It is noted that certain policies, namely \nthe clash between CI and stakeholders’ policies regarding per diem rates., created a barrier \nto engagement particularly from government agencies. It is also noted that there was high \nturnover in government agencies making it challenging to engage effectively. Project \nmanagement did attempt to adapt these challenges by engaging more mid-level staff, \nhowever these changes, while commendable, did not achieve the level of effectiveness to \nbe expected in similar projects. However, overall, in the context of the project’s intended \ngoals and Theory of Change, it was not clear at the time of the evaluation that these \nactivities contributed significantly to addressing the focal objective of improving policy \ncoordination. \nEfficiency \nMS \n \nThere were significant delays at the beginning of the project due to the difficulty in \ncoordinating and aligning with key stakeholders, namely government agencies. The \npartnerships forged with various agencies (e.g., LECRD, ICAT) contributed to enhanced \nefficiency. While this is not uncommon, these delays impacted the efficiency of the overall \nproject and the ability to make progress toward impact. Given the size of the project and \nthe pre-existing conditions of the Paris Agreement framework, the Climate Change \nDirectorate, and national policy to support these initiatives, it would have been advisable \nto obtain alignment with these agencies prior to commencing the project. Further, it was \nnoted by several participants, including international consultants, that project events were \nnot well organized in advance and attendance was lower than usually expected, resulting \nin reduced output from project activities. The complications and grievances relating to per \ndiem allowances and payment timelines also negatively impacted project efficiency.  \n \nOutcome \nStatus \n \nSet up a coordination platform that will be a combination of \nweb-based information, newsletters, in person meetings and \ncoordinated events to share ideas across the GoK ministries, \ndepartments, and professionals. \n \nMS \n\n \n \n31 \n \nProject Target: A fully functional coordination platform for all \ntransparency-related activities and other reporting at the \nnational, regional and global level established and working. The \nplatform will include a registry and prototype MRV system \n \nProject Results: Platform exists but not fully functional. Time \nwas not sufficient to properly establish the platform. Data \nexists but difficult for project participants and stakeholders to \naccess, which was apparently due to both licensing and \ntechnology constraints.  \n \n80. The project design profited from a thorough analysis of both country and regional \nrequirements. Although important cause – effect assumptions and potential risks \nwere outlined during project design, the project could have benefited from a more \ncomprehensive logic demonstrating that the projected results were achievable. The \nthree areas of capacity development; individual, institutional and external enabling \nenvironment, could have been addressed by a clearly defined theory of change. This \nlack meant that the design could not clearly articulate the linkages between results \nand did not develop strategies to address some of the external conditions that would \nimpact on project results, such as integration of administrative mechanisms, financing \nof involvement of government officials, etc. \n \n81. The main beneficiaries of the project included technicians at the government \nagencies and the 5 EWGs as well as representatives from private sector and \nuniversities. The project design envisaged that the involvement of these groups would \nmaximize the impact of the activities and allow them play a role in the projects \ndesired outcomes and levels of influence. Nonetheless the cause-effect associations \nbetween the actors was not clearly mapped out. The main project activities showing \nconnections and complementarity were spelled out in the Prodoc. However, \nimportant cause-effect assumptions were not clearly defined. A robust theory of \nchange would have greatly contributed to a more defined logic model for the project. \nA theory of change approach would have allowed for the examination of unintended \nresults as well as establishing the boundaries of the system and identified the \nassumptions that needed to be prioritized.  \n \n82. The project, particularly through the workshops, contributed to the capacity \ndevelopment of the stakeholders to effectively gather, recognize and analyze data \nrelated to GHG emissions and MRV reporting. Stakeholders interviewed highlighted \nthe importance of the workshops and the fact that they provided crucial information \nneeded for their work and also provided tools that were very useful and practical to \nuse. \n \n\n \n \n32 \n6.2. Project outputs \n83. The following tables review the project outputs and assessment at the time of the \nevaluation. \n \nOutcome 1.1 Institutional arrangements for data collection and sharing, QC/QA, \nanalysis and archiving strengthened in all the 6 IPCC sectors \nOutput Indicator 1.1.1: Focal points in \ninstitutions in the various 6 IPCC sectors \nformally established with job descriptions \nand KPIs, and functioning as hubs of data \ncollection and processing, with not less \nthan 33% of the focal points to be women \nCompleted: 6 focal points were \nestablished of which two were women. \nOutput Indicator 1.1.2: Data collection and \nsharing regulations, including linkages \nbetween the hubs and the CCD, developed \nand adopted by participating institutions \nfrom the 6 sectors and the 47 counties, \nand data collection, processing and sharing \narrangements formalized and \noperationalized through data sharing \nMoUs/Contracts. \nCompleted: Data collection and sharing \narrangements were formalized and \noperationalized.  \nOutput Indicator 1.1.3: A formal \narrangement for inter-ministerial \ncoordination established, and formal \ncooperation between Climate Change \nDirectorate and other stakeholders for the \ncoordination of data collection activities \ndefined and institutionalized \nCompleted: Arrangements were \noperationalized through sectoral and \ninstitutional data sharing agreements. \n \nOutcome 1.2 Capacities of government institutions and staff to collect, document, and \narchive key data in all sectors on a regular basis for the GHG inventory process built \nOutput Indicator 1.2.1: One hundred field \ndata staff (33% women), data suppliers, \nand platform users from the 6 emission \nsectors and counties (data hubs) trained \non GHG inventory data collection, data \ncollection tools, processing and \ntransmission of GHG data, and applying \nthe knowledge \nBelow target: Identified and trained \nthirty-four (34) trainees (Female 32% and \nMale 68 %) from CCD and the 6 GHG \nsectors. \n\n \n \n33 \nOutput Indicator 1.2.2: Fifty selected staff \n(33% women) from the data hubs and \nClimate Change Directorate trained in \ndomestic MRV systems, tracking NDCs, \nenhancement of GHG inventories and \nemission projections \nBelow Target: Identified and trained \nthirty-four (34) trainees (Female 32% and \nMale 68 %) from CCD and the 6 GHG \nsectors. \nNote: output 1.2.3 was removed. \n \nOutcome 1.3 Functional GHG inventory and MRV systems established, with climate \ndata and analysis integrated into policy making, NDC tracking, and international \nreporting \nOutput Indicator 1.3.2: General guidelines \nand tools to ensure consistency and \ncomparability of GHG emission projections \namong sectors are developed \nCompleted: Guidelines and tools were \nadopted.  \nOutput Indicator 1.3.3: National GHG \ninventory emissions, by sources and sinks, \nin place and made publicly available \nBelow target: The GHGI was developed to \na draft level but not fully in place and \npublicly available. \nOutput Indicator 1.3.4: Metrics, indicators, \nand methodologies for tracking adaptation \nadapted from the National Adaptation Plan \ninto the National MRV System \nCompleted: Metrics, indicators and \nmethodologies were integrated into the \nMRV platform. \nOutput Indicator 1.3.5: One hundred \npublic institution employees trained on \nreporting climate finance delivered \nBelow target: 15 Climate Change Officers \nwere trained \nOutput Indicator 1.3.9: Reliable, accurate, \nand credible reports generated for \nUNFCCC reporting under Paris Agreement, \nand used by stakeholders \nBelow target: Sector Inventory reports \nwere developed but not finalized.  \n \nNote: outputs 1.3.1, 1.3.6, 1.3.7, and 1.3.8 were removed. \nOutcome 2.1 Institutions and arrangements for data collection and sharing, QC/QA, \nanalysis and archiving strengthened for the land-based sector \nOutput Indicator 2.1.1: Institutional and \ntechnical capacities of 6 element working \ngroups (EWGs) under SLEEK data \nCompleted: Focal points and sectoral \nleads were established. \n\n \n \n34 \nstrengthened for data capture, sharing, \nprocessing, and archiving \nOutput Indicator 2.1.2: One hundred \nselected staff (33% women) of the EWGs \nmembers trained on land cover, soil, crop, \nforest, climate modeling and mapping \nspecific to climate action, to provide \nreliable, accurate, and credible reports for \nthe land sector \nBelow target: 25 staff from EWGs have \nbeen trained.

Assessment of Project Sustainability \n \n84. Overall, project sustainability is rated as Moderately Unlikely. The project faces \nnumerous risks to sustainability, particularly in the areas of financial and institutional \nrisks. These risks are certainly surmountable, however, with sound, targeted \ninvestment and management. However, our assessment indicates that the project \nresults are unlikely to be sustained without significant financial investment and \nimprovements to governance. \n \n85. Financial. Financial risks to sustainability relate to the need for continued investment \nand ongoing support to ensure the uptake the CBIT project’s results and \nincorporation into environmental policy and management. Financial sustainability is \nconsidered moderately unlikely due to the evidence that project activities had largely \ncome to a halt at the time of the evaluation. There does not appear to be a significant \nincrease in investment from Government. Thus, we find it highly unlikely that the \nproject results will be utilized, much less sustained or enhanced, without significant \nadditional financial support.  \n \n86. Institutional and Governance. Institutional and governance risks to sustainability are \nsignificant as well. CBIT project results are not yet being institutionalized in national \nplanning agencies to the extent that it is sufficiently operational and sustainable. \nGovernment agencies, including project participants, do not have access to data, and \nthe web platform and MRV systems are not operational to a state where they can be \nutilised or institutionalized. Difficulties appear to remain in project governance and \nimplementation between the executing agency and stakeholder participants. \nFurthermore, communication and coordination to align participants on project \ngovernance, matters such as per diem rates, is highly advisable. \n \n87. Socio-political. Socio-economic risks to sustainability are limited. The most significant \nrisk in this area is the ability to retain trained staff beyond the project. Significant staff \nturnover in Government agencies present a challenge that is not uncommon. \nFurtherance of the project results remains highly dependent on a small group of \nindividuals. It is advisable, where possible, that future efforts work to build the \ninstitutional capacities to support long-term career development. Such efforts should \ngo beyond skill building for short term projects and incorporate training for internal \ntrainers, training processes and procedures, training manuals and systems, \nmentorship programs and other similar approaches. \n \n88. Environmental. Environmental risks to sustainability are also limited, and \nenvironmental sustainability is considered highly likely. The project activities \npredominantly consist of capacity building, institutional coordination, and technology \nuse for data analysis with very limited environmental impact.  \n \n\n \n \n36 \n89. Catalytic Role and Up-scaling. It is too early to fully assess the role the project \ninvestment and results will play over the long term in catalysing the capacity needed \nfor Kenya to comply with the Paris Agreement and to enhance national development \nand decision making. The project has engaged a wide range of individuals and the \nclimate change topic will certainly grow in importance and likely provide \nopportunities for those individuals to scale up the results from the project. However, \nit must be noted that the incomplete nature of several aspects of the project \nincluding the GHGI itself, the inaccessibility of data enhanced during the project, and \nthe discontinuity from the end of the project with current activities may undermine \nthis catalytic potential.  \n \n \n8. Assessment of Project Monitoring & Evaluation Systems \n \n8.1. M&E Design  \n \n90. The rating for M&E design is Satisfactory. The project M&E overall follows the GEF \nrequirements and incorporates sound best practices.   A lack of an explicit Theory of \nChange was an identified shortcoming, making M&E against project objectives \ndifficult. \n \n91. The CBIT project M&E plan is outlined in the project document describing each of the \nplanned M&E activities, including roles, responsibilities, and timeframe (see Prodoc \npages 76-79). The identified M&E activities include inception workshop and report, \nquarterly and annual progress reporting (i.e. PIR), field visits, the independent \nexternal evaluations, and audits. A budget for each of these components was also \nprovided (Prodoc page 78). The M&E plan is summarized in a table in the Prodoc (in \nmultiple locations) showing responsible parties, budget, and timeframe for each of \nthe M&E activities.  \n \n92. The M&E plan appears to be standard and consistent with CI-GEF projects. A total of \naround $35,000 was explicitly budgeted for M&E activities overall, while additional \nactivities were budgeted in other categories such as project management.  \n \n93. The project results framework is a critical component of the project’s overall M&E \nframework. The initial project framework included baseline information, as well as \nindicators to assess and monitor results.  \n \n94. Accountability and responsibility were clearly established in the M&E design at \nproject inception. As stated in the Prodoc (pg 69)  \n \n• “The Project Management Unit on the ground will be responsible for initiating \nand organizing key monitoring and evaluation tasks. This includes the project \ninception workshop and report, quarterly progress reporting, annual progress \nand implementation reporting, documentation of lessons learned, and support \n\n \n \n37 \nfor and cooperation with the independent external evaluation exercises. The \nproject Executing Agency is responsible for ensuring the monitoring and \nevaluation activities are carried out in a timely and comprehensive manner, \nand for initiating key monitoring and evaluation activities, such as the \nindependent evaluation exercises” \n \n• “Key project executing partners are responsible for providing all required \ninformation and data necessary for timely and comprehensive project \nreporting, including results and financial data, as necessary and appropriate.” \n \n95. There was no logframe developed for the project. The targets and milestones were \ncontained in a results framework that was written as part of the project design phase. \nWhile the results framework and workplan spell out targets and annual milestones, \nthe lack of a logframe means that there is no piloting tool that can be used to monitor \nand evaluate the project’s achievements during the project,  over its life cycle. Annex \n1 of the ProDoc could have been enhanced as a logframe to clearly define what the \nproject is trying to achieve: given the change in project focus, revising the logframe \nwould have provided a clear indication of the new project goals and targets. \n \n96. Under the timeframe of the project, the M&E plan did not include a component on \ndeveloping national indicators for MRV and GHG reporting. Not only would such an \nindicator framework have assisted the M&E process within the project, it would have \nlikely increased the familiarization of robust M&E systems among the stakeholders \nand assisted with any post-project monitoring. \n \n97. The project document clearly specifies who is responsible for project M&E activities. \nThe various stages of the project (from inception through implementation) and the \nsteps that are needed to ensure success. The design also identified periodic reports \nincluding PIRs, quarterly reports, technical reports etc., and provided a summary of \nthe expectations periodic monitoring reports.  \n \n98. The financial documents did not contain a complete indicative cost for M&E activities \n($15,000 for evaluations) beyond staff salaries. The evaluation team was unable to \nsecure interviews with the finance management team during the in-country portion \nof the evaluation and thus, it was not possible to validate what the budget was or \nhow it was utilized. \n \n99. The CBIT project met the expectations of the GEF award, and together with a section \nthat defined the indicators, laid out a clear path for monitoring project progress. The \nindicators selected by the project were consistent with GEF’s SMART indicators for \nGHG and MRV reporting. The design specified that the indicators for the project were \nreviewed during the inception phase. \n \n100. \nProject indicators were, in general terms, appropriate, and complied with \nSMART criteria. They included measures of increases in capacity and documentation \nof project results.  \n\n \n \n38 \n \n101. \nThis approach applied by the project is a standard one and measuring impact \nof training can only be done much later following similar work. The project’s approach \nwas to combine such training with actual work on the GHG inventory thereby \ndemonstrating effectiveness of training through production of the project output. The \nKenya GHG inventory is unique in that it was actually done by Kenyan government \nstaff ‘during their training’.  \n \n102. \nAt the time of the evaluation the CCD stated it is confident it has the \npersonnel to do a 2nd iteration of the inventory. Sector leads and CCD staff had also \nbeen carrying out their inventory work without external technical input. However, it \nmust be noted that the inventory had not been completed at the time of the \nevaluation, so it was difficult to assess this area of technical capacity building.    \n \n103. \nAn indicative M&E workplan was included in the project design. The outputs \ncontributed directly to the outcomes. The M&E design – including the performance \nindicators (23) and tracking tools (2) – are a good basis for capturing and reporting on \nprogress. \n \n8.2. M&E Implementation \n \n104. \nThe implementation of the M&E framework was rated Satisfactory. Broadly \nspeaking the project operated the M&E plan consistent with the original design and \nGEF framework.  \n \n105. \nProject progress was reported on a quarterly and yearly basis. There was also \na project implementation review (PIR) process, M&E activities, lead responsible \nparties, and timeframe are clearly identified in the M&E section of the project \ndocument.  \n \n106. \nThe monitoring instruments of the CBIT project were quarterly technical and \nfinancial reports, and a terminal evaluation. Additionally, a range of tools was \nemployed by the project to monitor project progress and achievement – field visits \nfrom joint CI/ GEF teams also helped to monitor progress. The project steering \ncommittee meetings could also be seen as a monitoring tool. Meetings were held at \nregular intervals with updates being provided by the project manager. Quarterly \nreports and site visit reports were produced to show the results being achieved. \nThese reports are comprehensive progress reports providing good monitoring \ninformation documenting the project’s progress year over year. Finally, the GEF \ntracking tool can be considered as a monitoring tool. The evaluation team was able to \nsee 2 tracking tools produced in Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020. It would seem that the \nproject used the GEF CBIT tracking tool to its best advantage. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n39 \n107. \nAnnual reports were produced in a timely fashion. \n \n108. \nDue to the project’s short timeframe, a mid-term management review or \nevaluation was not planned nor performed. Mid-term assessments allow for adaptive \nlearning and management corrections to sustain momentum and ensure progress \nachievements of targets. This was not possible under this project. \n \n109. \nAs mentioned earlier, the evaluation team was unable to ascertain the full \nbudgeting requirements for M&E implementation. \n \n110. \nDuring the evaluation we identified several instances where the M&E \nimplementation triggered key actions and the project responded to these issues. For \nexample, there were complaints about per diem allowances to Government \nEmployees. Despite some delay, the project did respond to these grievances in a \ntimely and responsible manner.  \n \n111. \nThe evaluation also found that the M&E activities were utilized and helpful in \nguiding project management and responded to any required changes. Specific \n“SMART” metrics were employed for parts of the M&E and this served as a useful \nguide and benchmark for the project.  \n \n9. Assessment of Project Implementation & Execution \n \n112. \nThe project set out clear arrangements for implementation and execution. As \nstated in the Prodoc (pg 53): \n• “The project will be co-executed over an eighteen-month period by the \nGovernment of Kenya (GoK), through its Ministry of Environment and Natural \nResources (MENR) with Vital Signs Greenhouse Gas Management Institute \n(GHGMI) and the SLEEK Secretariat. A Project Steering Committee will be \nestablished, composed of MENR, SLEEK Secretariat, Vital Signs and GHGMI. \n• The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MENR) will have overall \nmanagement responsibility for implementing all technical aspects of the \nproject. The project will be located within the MENR, under the Climate Change \nDirectorate (CCD), whose Director will be responsible for the overall \nmanagement of the project and its activities. The Project Management Unit \n(PMU) will be located at the MENR and will be headed by a Project Manager, \nwho will manage the project and its activities.” \n \n113. \nFurther, the Conservation International GEF Agency was identified in the \nProdoc to provide project assurance and support: (Prodoc, pg 74) \n• “The CI-GEF Project Agency will provide project assurance, including \nsupporting project implementation by maintaining oversight of all technical \nand financial management aspects, and providing other assistance upon \nrequest of the Executing Agency. The CI-GEF Project Agency will also monitor \n\n \n \n40 \nthe project’s implementation and achievement of the project outputs, ensure \nthe proper use of GEF funds, and review and approve any changes in budgets \nor work plans. The CI-GEF Project Agency will arbitrate and ensure resolution \nof any execution conflicts.” \n \n114. \nThe following diagram, also from the Prodoc (pg 75) shows the project \nexecution organizational structure.  \n \n \n \n9.1. Quality of Implementation \n \n115. \nProject Implementation was rated as Satisfactory. CI is the GEF Agency \nresponsible for the project including oversight responsibilities. Overall, CI adequately \nsupported the project providing satisfactory backstopping, adaptive management \nsupport, and management support.  \n \n116. \nWe reviewed the Trip Report provided to us covering the assessment carried \nout by CI-GEF in March 2019. The report and assessment appear to have be thorough, \nwell-structured, and thoughtful. We noted that many of the challenges reported here \nin our assessment were identified in this progress report. For instance, the assessors:  \n \n• Noted CCD had not yet started utilizing MRV equipment at that stage \n• Raised concerns about how the CBIT Kenya will ensure that capacity building \nhas long-term impact \n• Noted “weak coordination technical and OPS team in decision making \nregarding budgets” \n\n \n \n41 \n \n117. \nThe project sufficiently implemented the key GEF project requirements \nincluding outcome reporting, financial reporting, operating grievance mechanisms, \nand implementing safeguards. All of these project activities have been rated \nsatisfactory or higher.  \n \n118. \nOverall, the project faced significant difficulties to implementation due to \nGovernment staff turnover and policies regarding engagement in project activities.  \n \n119. \nIndeed, the CI-GEF progress report from the March 2019 site visit stated  \n \n• “There is a risk of only fulfilling near-term outputs due to the following \nreasons:  \ni. Unclear strategy of how up-take of capacity building initiatives will \nhave a long-term impact  \nii. Unclear project Exit and Sustainability Strategy. “ \n \n \n120. \nAdditionally, changes in priorities and organizational structures relating \nspecifically to SLEEK meant it was difficult to engage constructively and effectively \nthrough this framework. These are challenges that were unforeseen fully at project \ninception. \n \n121. \nOverall, the evaluation found however, that from an implementation \nstandpoint, the project handled these difficulties in a satisfactory manner given the \ncircumstances. \n \n122. \nThe project’s internal coordination, financial management, and adaptive \nmanagement are all aspects of implementation. These aspects were all handled \nconsistent with GEF requirements.  \n \n123. \nThe project faced some delays during implementation, which slightly affected \nthe project’s secondary results in terms of engagement and accomplishment of key \noutcomes.  \n9.2. Quality of Execution \n \n124. \nThe day to day management of the CBIT project was rated Moderately \nSatisfactory. The project exhibited sufficient internal communication and \ncoordination, work planning, adaptive management, financial management, and \nreporting.  \n \n125. \nIt is worth noting that the project was a multi-stakeholder effort involving \nnumerous Government agencies and international organizations. Coordinating and \nexecuting such efforts is not a simple task.  \n \n\n \n \n42 \n126. \nThe management of project activities had strengths. Participants overall \nreported communication and coordination as good. Initial delays at the beginning of \nthe project made management more difficult, particularly as it relates to expectations \nand deadlines. The project management appears to have adapted well to this \nchallenge.   \n \n127. \nOn the other hand, the project also had weaknesses. The rigorous nature of \nfinancial requirements, specifically those relating to per-diem payments and transport \nreimbursements, created a significant challenge to project execution. On one hand, \nsome participants felt that communication was good, and the expectations of what \nwas required from them was very clear, which allowed them to go off and do their \nwork and produce the outputs expected of them. At the same time, some participants \nfelt that the management of the project workflow was too flexible, without \nadequately set deadlines and targets, which resulted in a lot of “slippage” in the \ntiming of project outputs, and which “resulted in a lot of stress on us” (see additional \ndiscussion on timing of project activities and results in Section V.C below).  \n \n128. \nAn additional issue raised by several participants is that the CI procurement \nand contracting procedures required more time than project participants expected. \nThis often-caused delays and disruption to travel planning and project events, such as \nworkshops. More care could have been taken to raise awareness of these rigorous \nprocedures and proactively manage them to mitigate disruption.  \n \n129. \nSupport for the evaluation from project management was limited and could \nhave been improved.  \n• Notices to participants to seek their involvement in the evaluation were sent \nout late. \n• Assistance to the in-country evaluation was poorly coordinated by CI-Kenya, \nfrom a logistical and scheduling standpoint.  \n• The in-country evaluator was sent to the wrong address in different parts of \nthe city on more than one occasion.  \n• Ground transport was not arranged, and minimal assistance was provided. \n• Project management staff were difficult to track down and schedule for \nmeetings.  \n \n130. \nThe limited support for the evaluation from CI, the executing agency, \nunfortunately may have meant that appropriate information and context was not \nprovided. This is difficult to determine given the short period of the evaluation. The \nevaluation team went to great lengths to secure time with CI management staff and \nsupport coordination with stakeholders. For future evaluations, this process should be \nmanaged more proactively and effectively to ensure the most efficient and thorough \nevaluation possible.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n43 \n \n9.3. Financial Management \n \n131. \nProject financial management was also Satisfactory consistent with the overall \nImplementation and Execution ratings.  \n \n132. \nFinancial reporting appears to have happened in a timely and accurate way. \nReporting was consistent with GEF guidelines and requirements. Additionally, detailed \nprocurement guidelines were followed throughout the project with commensurate \nreporting.  \n \n133. \nThe following table summarizes the budget provided at project inception in \nthe Prodoc (pg 81). As shown, the vast majority of project spend was planned for year \n1 with no spend in years 3 and 4. \n \nProposed Budget \n` \n  \n  \n  \n  \nYear 1 \nYear 2 \nYear 3 \nYear 4 \nTotal budget \nPersonnel Salaries \nand benefits \n$145,044  \n$77,664  \n  \n  \n$222,708  \nProfessional \nservices \n$172,314  \n$14,900  \n  \n  \n$187,214  \nTravels and \naccommodations \n$202,220  \n$34,734  \n  \n  \n$236,954  \nMeetings and \nworkshops \n$110,720  \n$34,608  \n  \n  \n$145,328  \nGrants & \nAgreements \n$160,000  \n  \n  \n  \n$160,000  \nEquipment \n$15,000  \n  \n  \n  \n$15,000  \nOther Direct Costs \n$21,458  \n$11,338  \n  \n  \n$32,796  \nTOTAL GEF \nFUNDED PROJECT \n$826,756  \n$173,244  \n  \n  \n$1,000,000  \n \n134. \nThe Final Budget report provided for the evaluation summarizes actual \nexpenditure by year as follows:  \n \n \n Actual \nspending \nY1 \nY2 \nY3 \n  \n Grand Total  \n$48,615.60  \n$597,015.37  \n$354,369.03  \n$1,000,000.00  \n \n• In fact, actual spending shows significant variance from the proposed. From an \nevaluation standpoint, this is not problematic in terms of overall financial or \nproject management and effectiveness. Thus, this has not played a role in the \noverall rating.  \n\n \n \n44 \n \n• However, it is worth noting that this budget variance appears to be symptomatic \nof some of the other underlying challenges faced by the project. These include \ninitial delays at the beginning of the project and incomplete components at the \nend of the project. It would appear that had execution in the earlier stages of the \nproject gone more smoothly without delays then the risk of not achieving goals \nwould have been diminished.  \n \n135. \nFurthermore, project funding by component was planned as follows (Prodoc, \npg 80) \n \n  \nProposed project budget by component (in USD) \nComponent \nComponent  \nComponent \n3 \nPMC \nTotal budget \n1 \n2 \nPersonnel \nSalaries and \nbenefits \n$31,377  \n$31,377  \n$77,218  \n$82,900  \n$222,872  \nProfessional \nServices \n$64,430  \n$29,584  \n$91,000  \n$2,000  \n$187,014  \nTravels and \naccommodations \n$144,408  \n$81,776  \n$10,770  \n- \n$236,954  \nMeetings and \nworkshops \n$41,512  \n$94,576  \n$9,240  \n  \n$145,328  \nGrants & \nAgreements \n$160,000  \n  \n  \n  \n$160,000  \nEquipment \n$15,000  \n  \n  \n  \n$15,000  \nOther Direct \nCosts \n$6,814  \n$6,814  \n$13,195  \n$6,009  \n$32,832  \nTOTAL GEF \nFUNDED \nPROJECT \n$463,541  \n$244,127.00  \n$201,423  \n$90,909  \n$1,000,000  \n \n136. \nThe Final Budget report provided for the evaluation summarizes actual \nexpenditure as follows:  \n \n Actual \nspending \nC1 \nC2 \nC3 \nPMC \nTotal \nGrand Total \n    $567,158.40  $149,665.62  \n    \n$180,340.59  \n    \n$102,835.39  \n     \n$1,000,000.00  \n \n• As shown, there is a significant variance in the planned vs actual budget in \ncomponents 1 and 2:  \n§ Component 1 received 22% more funding than planned. \n§ Component 2 received 39% less funding than planned.  \n \n\n \n \n45 \n• Again, as noted above, from an evaluation standpoint this is not necessarily \nviewed as problematic in terms of overall financial or project management and \neffectiveness. Thus, this has not played a role in the rating here for \nimplementation and financial management.  \n \n• However, also as above, it is worth noting that this budget variance appears to be \nsymptomatic of some of the other underlying challenges faced by the project \nrelating to Component 2 specifically. It remains unclear whether the project \nperformance area was a result of budget allocations or whether budget \nallocations were a result of adaptive management. Thus, we it is inconclusive \nwhether the variance is a deficiency in project implementation or execution. \n \n• Regardless, it is consistent that the project did not fund Component 2 to the level \nplanned and the project, as per the evaluation section above, did not achieve its \ngoals in this area.  \n \n10. Assessment of Project Environmental & Social Safeguards \n \n10.1. \nEnvironmental Safeguards Rating \n \n137. \nEnvironmental safeguards are rated as Satisfactory. Overall, the risks related \nto this project are inherently low. The major environmental risk from the project is \nthe extent to which the data used for the project are accurate.  \n \n138. \nIt should be noted that some stakeholders and participants expressed \nconcerns about the accuracy of the data and models produced / enhanced through \nthe project. Such faults in data could lead to inappropriate policy and environmental \nmanagement. \n \n139. \nThe project safeguards in this area could have been improved at the design \nstage by including an external quality assurance review of the data related outputs.  \n \n140. \nHowever, for the purposes of this evaluation:  \n• The likely risk of data-related errors directly or significantly contributing to \nnegative environmental impacts is low.  \n• It is beyond the scope of the evaluation to conduct a detailed data quality \nreview.  \n \n \n10.2. \nGender \n \n141. \nThe project’s Gender Safeguards were is rated as Highly Satisfactory. The CBIT \nproject did include attention to and some awareness of gender-related aspects. The \nProdoc included a brief discussion on gender mainstreaming, stating  \n\n \n \n46 \n• “To ensure that the project meets CI-GEF Project Agency’s Gender \nMainstreaming Policy, the project will develop a Gender Mainstreaming Plan \nthat will ensure the mainstreaming of gender issues throughout the project.  \n• “The mainstreaming of gender is necessary because the Government of Kenya \nhas made a pledge through its INDC and other policies to ensure gender \nmainstreaming, with a priority adaptation action which aims to \"Strengthen \nthe adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable groups and communities through \nsocial safety nets and insurance schemes”. \n• “The project will mainstream gender and empower women more because \nwomen are more negatively impacted by forest protection projects; e.g., \nhaving to go further for firewood due to shortage and by increasing farm \nforestry, they will have access to firewood easily which in turn frees up their \ntime for other activities. They will also be included in decision making in the \nrelation to management of land uses and planning.” \n• The Prodoc also provided further detailed safeguard plans. (Prodoc Appendix \nVI) \n \n142. \nThe project also set specific targets as noted in the PIR document outlining \nefforts including:  \ni. Conducting training on gender mainstreaming \nii. Specifically outreach to women for involvement in training programs \niii. Have at least 30% of project participants be female \niv. Train equal numbers of men and women in data capture \nv. Establish gender focal points in relevant organizations \nvi. Achieve representation of women in decision making and leadership \nroles \n \n143. \nThe project undertook deliberate efforts to implement its gender \nmainstreaming plan and achieved the above targets in most areas. There were several \nnotable areas where performance did not exceed or match targets:  \n• In terms of training, of the 305 participants in training, 121 were female, \nrepresenting 40%. While this is below the stated overall training target of \n50:50, it is still a commendable level, particularly given that women working in \nGHG activities are relatively few compared to men.  \n• The project did not establish the intended focal points; however, sectoral focal \npoints were established, of which two were women. \n \n144. \nOverall, however, the project surpassed its stated goal of at least 30% female \nparticipation in the project. Thus, it is the view of the evaluators that the project: \n• Designed and implemented an effective gender mainstreaming plan \n• Achieved most targets and surpassed expectations in several areas \n• Dealt with challenges quickly and effectively \n \n \n\n \n \n47 \n10.3. \nStakeholder engagement \n \n145. \nThe projects Stakeholder Engagement Safeguard is rated as Satisfactory. The \nproject achieved participation from a reasonably diverse group of stakeholders. \n \n146. \nThe project identified key performance indicators in this area as noted in the \nProdoc as follows:  \n• “Number of government agencies, civil society organizations, private sector, \nindigenous peoples and other stakeholder groups that have been involved in \nthe project implementation phase on an annual basis \n• Number persons (sex-disaggregated) that have been involved in the project \nimplementation phase (on an annual basis) \n• Number of engagement (e.g. meeting, workshops, consultations) with \nstakeholders during the project implementation phase (on an annual basis) \n• Percentage of stakeholders who rate as satisfactory the level at which their \nviews and concerns are taken into account by the project.” \n \n147. \nThe project did not establish specific targets for stakeholder engagement \nrelated to these performance indicators. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate project \nimplementation against the initial project plan. The project design could have been \nimproved with the inclusion of more specific targets in the area of stakeholder \nengagement.  \n \n148. \nThrough various consultations with stakeholders and project participants, we \nfound, in summary, the feedback was positive:  \n• The project engaged a wide range of Government agencies \n• The project engaged a diversity of Government and non-government \norganizations \n• The project activities were inclusive of various population segments such as \ngender and geography. \n• The project offered multiple touch points for engagement with this range of \nstakeholders \n \n149. \nConstraints on project participation overall, as noted in other parts of this \nevaluation relating to policies and procedures, contributed to lower levels of \nparticipation in project events and trainings. However, it is commendable that despite \nsuch constraints, the project was able to maintain viable stakeholder engagement.  \n \n \n10.4. \nAccountability and Grievance Mechanism \n \n150. \nThe project’s Accountability and Grievance Mechanism Safeguard is rated as \nSatisfactory. Overall, we found the Grievance Mechanism to be both well designed \nand implemented throughout the project.  \n \n\n \n \n48 \n151. \nThe Grievance Mechanism was designed as part of the initial Prodoc is \nconsistent with GEF requirements and best practices. As stated in the Prodoc  \n• “Accountability and Grievance Mechanism Policy, the project will develop \nAccountability and Grievance Mechanism plan that will ensure people affected \nby the project are able to bring their grievances for consideration and redress. \nThe mechanism will be in place before the start of project activities and will be \ndisclosed to all stakeholders in English and Kiswahili and all grievances received \nwill be disclosed by the project to CI and GEF. \n• The grievances will be received through, telephone, email or written \nsubmissions and procedures will be in place to receive and record them after \nwhich they will be addressed by relevant persons.” \n \n152. \nThe project undertook efforts to make stakeholders aware of the Grievance \nMechanism. Through the evaluation, we found awareness of the Grievance \nMechanism was wide-spread and regarded as sufficient. \n \n153. \nThe Grievance Mechanism was triggered two times during the project. As \nnoted in the PIR document, grievances were received regarding:  \n• Low per-diem rate, and \n• Delayed payment of per-diem and transport reimbursements. \n \n154. \nIt is not the scope of this evaluation to assess the validity of these grievances \nnor the viability of any arguments nor evidence provided.  \n \n155. \nThe evaluation, including interviews with project participants and \nstakeholders, found that the Grievance Mechanism when triggered was managed in \nboth a timely and effective manner. The project successfully resolved these conflicts \nin a reasonable time frame and was able to mitigate, to a reasonable degree given the \ncircumstances, any negative impact such grievances may have had on the project. \n \n \n11. Additional Assessment Areas \n \n11.1. \nMaterialization of co-financing \n \n156. \nThe project anticipated co-financing totalling $1.1M (Prodoc, pg. 2) as follows:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCO-FINANCING 1:  CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL \n$50,000 \nCO-FINANCING 2: GOVERNMENT OF KENYA (GOK ) \n$1,000,000 \nCO-FINANCING 3: THE GREENHOUSE GAS MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE (GHGMI) \n$50,000 \n\n \n \n49 \n157. \nThe PIR reported that the co-financing realized as of June 30, 2019 was \n$510,029, or approximately 50% of total planned co-financing remained outstanding \nwith three months remaining before the project end. \n \n158. \nDuring the evaluation, we were unable to obtain a comprehensive accounting \nof co-financing at the end of the project. The final financial report does not include an \nexplicit or clear accounting of co-financing from any of the planned sources. However, \ngiven the level of co-financing confirmed through June 30, 2019, it is unlikely that the \nremaining 50% of all co-financing was secured (let alone spent) in the final 3 months \nof the project.  \n \n159. \nA clear accounting of project co-financing broken down by source, timing and \ncomponent would improve overall project reporting and facilitate any further \nevaluation.  \n \n11.2. \nNeed for follow-up \n \n160. \nWe recommend follow-up to aid further progress to impact:  \n• Data access: As noted, several data sources related to the project remained \ninaccessible. Ensuring access for all participants and from all relevant parties \nshould be a priority. \n• Data quality assurance: Following on from the above point, an independent \nassessment of data quality is advisable. This would help ensure a strong \nfoundation for future work that may build upon the project’s \naccomplishments. \n• Co-financing: As stated above ensuring a transparent accounting of total co-\nfinancing is advisable. \n \n11.3. \nLessons and Recommendations \n161. \nThe terminal evaluation has identified a summary of lessons from the \nexperience of the CBIT project. CI should aggregate these lessons and apply them to \nsimilar projects now and in the future.  \n \n162. \nLesson 1: Coordinating projects with Government agencies with regard to \nfinancial policies and restrictions can be complex and present significant risk to \nproject performance.  \n \n163. \nRecommendation 1: As much as possible, policies and implementation \nprotocols should be agreed prior to project initiation so that Government agencies \nunderstand and comply with financial policies/restrictions.   The GEF and CI should \nreconsider policies and potential exceptions to per diem and travel reimbursements \nfor in-country participants. Should this not be possible the GEF and CI should ensure \nsuch policies are clearly communicated to potential project participants prior to \nproject launch. \n\n \n \n50 \n \n164. \nLesson 2: Staff turnover can significantly impact the viability and effectiveness \nof training programs and should be taken into consideration at the design and \nplanning stage.  \n \n165. \nRecommendation 2: Anticipating high staff turnover, project management \nshould identify ways to maintain institutional memory: in collaboration with \nGovernment agencies, the project should produce training manuals; protocols should \ninclude training new staff before project-trained staff move to new positions. The GEF \nand CI should consider alternative approaches to capacity building such as online \ntraining and more frequent and sustained engagement over a longer period of time. \nThese types of approaches may ensure higher levels of participation while potentially \nreducing travel costs to a significant degree. There are multiple methods ranging \nfrom enrolled courses to mentorships. The evaluators have had direct experience \nwith such approaches. However, it is beyond the scope of the evaluation to provide \ndetailed guidance on training program methods \n \n166. \nLesson 3: Project delays early in the project timeline can present significant \nchallenges to achieving intended outcomes. \n \n167. \nRecommendation 3: All projects face the challenge of unforeseen delays, and \nso all projects should include regular M&E and flexibility to respond as needed, as \nsoon as possible. The GEF and CI should ensure financial planning and procurement \nare aligned with project timelines to mitigate risk and delays to project performance. \n \n168. \nAdditional Recommendations: The GEF and CI should commission a data \nquality assessment and review to validate the current state of data and MRV systems \nfor climate change reporting. Such a study would provide an independent and verified \nunderstanding of the data and its viability for use in follow on projects. The results of \nsuch an assessment should be transparently and openly shared with all project \nparticipants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n51 \n \n \nAnnex A: Evaluation Methodology \n \nGEF Terminal Evaluation Methodology \nRegarding Project Titled:  \n“Strengthening National Capacity in Kenya to Meet the \nTransparency Requirements of the Paris Agreement and \nSupporting the Coordination of National, Regional and Global \nTransparency-related Activities in Kenya “ \n \n \nNatural  \nCapital  \nAdvisors, LLC \n \nOverview \nWe will conduct an analytically rigorous and systematic approach to evaluate project design, \nexecution, and overall impact. Through our extensive experience in projects focused on \nnatural resource governance we have developed a thorough understanding of the standards, \nmethods, and best practices for fostering transparency and accountability. Our approach will \nyield lessons from this project and our hope is to also provide insights that assist GEF with \nsimilar evaluations across its portfolio.   \n \nWe are independent of all GEF-funded projects, nonetheless we are familiar with the GEF \nprograms and strategies, as well as relevant GEF policies such as those on project cycle, M&E, \nco-financing, fiduciary standards, gender, environmental and social safeguards. Moreover, \nwe will abide by the GEF Evaluation Office Ethical Guidelines. \n11.3.1. \nMethodology \nWe base our methodology on the principles of good governance, especially an inclusive \napproach to relevant stakeholder participation.  Our methods are based on three key values:  \n• \nTransparency: We will gather information on project performance and results from \nmultiple sources including the project M&E system, tracking tools, field visits, \nstakeholder interviews, project documents, and other independent sources, to \nfacilitate triangulation. We ensure all information is organised, accessible and \ntraceable. \n\n \n \n52 \n• \nAnalytical Rigour: We seek the necessary contextual information to assess the \nsignificance and relevance of observed performance and results. Our analyses are \ndeveloped with rigor and transparently provided to stakeholders for review.  Further, \nas independent evaluators, our analytical approach requires that we are impartial and \nwill present a balanced account consistent with the evidence.  \n• \nCommunication: We conduct our work and analysis as an open book and seek to \nengage stakeholders in frequent, open and clear communication. Where practicable \nwe employ various project management collaboration tools to ensure all parties are \non the same page throughout the project. Further, we provide clear, concise final \nproducts that are easy to understand and useful for our clients.   \n \nWe will utilize a ratings system to ensure we establish the sound basis of evidence, \nunderstanding, and methodology for making the assessment.    \n11.3.2. \nTechnical Approach \nOur technical approach will be fully consistent with the Scope of Work and will be driven by \nfour key areas of focus:  \n• \nDefinition: Ensure all parties are clear and in agreement with the purpose, scope, and \nmethodology of the evaluation.   Clear expectations will ensure successful delivery. \n• \nProject Due Diligence: Conduct a thorough review of documentation such as initial \nproject documents, budgets, standards, reports, workplans, and relevant GEF policies. \nWe will interview key stakeholders, including those in project-site countries to gain a \ncomprehensive view of project activities, execution, and impact.  \n• \nAnalytical Rating: Develop a rigorous, data-driven analytical approach to support \nand  justify ratings for the project. This analytical approach will be grounded in the \ndefinition and due diligence outputs, explained above.    \n \nWe have extensive experience managing and evaluating conservation projects in Africa. \nFurther, we have specific experience and knowledge of both the legal frameworks, natural \nenvironment, and socio-political-cultural context of conservation planning and management \nin East Africa. We will incorporate this knowledge to deepen the project due diligence \nelement of our approach related to the project components as follows:  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \nComponent 1: Strengthening national institutions and capacities in Kenya to enhance MRV \ntransparency in line with Kenya’s national priorities   \n \n \n \n \n \n• \nWe will leverage our experience in capacity building in Africa to develop a robust \nassessment of the component. Specifically, Mr. Christie led one of the most \ncomprehensive natural resource capacity building program in Africa. Dr. Blundell has \nled numerous capacity building initiatives and workshops throughout Africa, Latin \nAmerica and asia. Our experience and deep familiarity with best practices and \nsupporting methodologies enables us to quickly apply this lens to the context in \nKenya. We are also familiar with all of the relevant agencies and national programs \ninvolved in the Paris Agreement so can readily assess these project activities and \noutcomes.   \n \n \n \n \nComponent 2: Supporting enhancements to the System for Land-Based Emission Estimation \nin Kenya (SLEEK) to assist with improvement of transparency over time \n\n \n \n53 \n• \nThrough our many years of experience working in land planning and management as \nwell as carbon emissions we have developed and evaluated similar programs and \ntherefore have a strong basis upon which to rapidly evaluate this component. \nFurther, we are intimately familiar with the key methodologies and best practices \nrequired for land-based emissions estimations, standards for transparency, and the \ncapacity required to achieve accurate results. In particular, Dr. Blundell’s leadership of \nseveral transparency initiatives combined with Mr. Christie’s extensive knowledge of \nemissions estimation methods make us readily capable to execute this component of \nthe evaluation.     \n \n \n \n \n \nComponent 3: Supporting the enhancement of the coordination between national, regional \nand global transparency related activities in Kenya. \n• \nAs noted above our team poses extensive experience coordinating land management \nprograms and transparency initiatives across nation, regional and global agencies \nranging from country level environmental and forest ministries to multi-lateral \norganizations including the United Nations. Indeed Dr. Blundell was an expert advisor \nand Chairman of the Panel of Experts reporting to the United Nations Security Council \non several transparency programs. We have an intimate and practical knowledge of \nhow such coordination works best and the activities and outcomes required for \nsuccess.  \nWorkshop Engagement and Key Interviews \nThis experience explained above ensures we will provide a comprehensive, detailed, and \nanalytically rigorous evaluation that is both integrative of the Kenyan context, Paris \nAgreement requirements, and supported by international best practice of land-based \nemissions measurements and transparency.. This robust approach will be further \ncomplemented by the workshop we will hold to engage stakeholders and ensure clarity of \nthe evaluation objectives and methods. As noted above our extensive experience in Africa \naffords us the ability to quickly and effectively engage with all stakeholders in both workshop \nsettings and direct interviews.  \n \nOur technical approach will also directly address the key elements of the final evaluation \nreport as follows:  \n11.3.3. \nTheory of Change \nIf appropriate, and after consultations with the project stakeholders, NCA, as evaluator, may \nrefine each project’s theory of change.  Where an explicit theory of change is not provided in \nthe project documents, NCA will develop one based on information provided in the project \ndocuments and through consultations with the project stakeholders. \n11.3.4. \nAssessment of Project Results \nThe Terminal Evaluation report will assess and rate the extent to which the project objectives \n– as stated in the documents submitted at the CEO Endorsement stage – have been \nachieved. The Terminal Evaluation report will also indicate if there were any changes in \nproject design and/or expected results after the start of implementation. If the project did \n\n \n \n54 \nnot establish a baseline, then, where feasible, NCA will estimate the baseline conditions so \nthat change can be determined, in particular those attributable to the project. Where \napplicable, the Terminal Evaluation report will include an assessment of the level of \nachievement of the GEF corporate results targets to which the project contributes and will \nalso incorporate data from the focal area tracking tool. \n• \nOutputs:  The Terminal Evaluation report will rate the extent to which the expected \noutput[s] were delivered and identify and assess any factors that affected delivery. \n• \nOutcomes:  The Terminal Evaluation report will rate the extent to which the expected \noutcome[s] were achieved and the extent to which their achievement was dependent \non delivery of project outputs, as well as assessing the factors that affected outcome \nachievement (e.g., project design, project’s linkages with other activities, extent and \nmaterialization of co-financing, stakeholder involvement, etc.). As appropriate, the \nTerminal Evaluation report will also evaluate the extent the project contributed to the \nprogram outcomes.  \n• \nCriteria for Outcome Ratings:  Outcome ratings (6-point scale; highly satisfactory to \nhighly unsatisfactory) will incorporate project achievements against expected targets. \nProject outcomes will be rated on three dimensions: \n§ \nRelevance: Congruence with the GEF strategies, country priorities, and \nAgency mandates; was the project design appropriate for delivering \nthe expected outcomes?) \n§ \nEffectiveness: Were outcomes commensurate with expectations? \n§ \nEfficiency: Cost-effective, both time and financial. We will also \ncompare efficiency performance against similar projects within our \nexperience.  \n \n11.3.5. \nSustainability Rating  \nUsing a 4-point scale (likely to unlikely) we will identify, weigh, and explain key risks (i.e., \nlikelihood & magnitude of impacts) to the continuation of benefits from the project after the \nGEF project ends. The analysis will cover financial, socio-political, institutional, and \nenvironmental risks. \n \n11.3.6. \nProgress to Impact \nThe Terminal Evaluation report will assess the extent to which the progress towards long-\nterm impact may be attributed to the project (i.e., the counterfactual: if the project had not \nbeen implemented, then what would have been different) and to other actors and factors. \nWhere relevant, we will assess the merits of rival explanations for the observed impact and \ngive reasons for accepting or rejecting them. \n \nWe will report the available qualitative and quantitative evidence on environmental stress \nreduction (e.g. GHG emission reduction, reduction of waste discharge, etc.) and \nenvironmental status change (e.g. change in the population of endangered species, forest \nstock, water retention in degraded lands, etc.), noting the source of the information and \nclarifying the scale/s at which the described environmental stress reduction is being \nachieved. \n \n\n \n \n55 \nIn addition to on-the-ground change in the physical environment, the Terminal Evaluation \nreport will evaluate the project’s contribution to change in socioeconomic status (income, \nhealth, well-being, etc.).  We will also evaluate the likelihood for further change, based on the \nproject’s contributions to changes in policy/ legal/regulatory frameworks. This includes \nobserved changes to institutions in their capacities (awareness, knowledge, skills, \ninfrastructure, monitoring systems, etc.) and governance architecture, including access to \nand use of information (laws, administrative bodies, trust-building and conflict resolution \nprocesses, information-sharing systems, etc.). \n \nWhere the environmental and social changes are being achieved at scales beyond the \nimmediate area of intervention, the Terminal Evaluation report will provide an account of the \nprocesses such as sustaining, mainstreaming, replication, scaling up, and market change, \nthrough which these changes have taken place. Furthermore, we will determine if there are \narrangements to facilitate follow-up actions and we will document instances where the GEF \npromoted approaches, technologies, financing instruments, legal frameworks, information \nsystems, etc., were adopted/implemented without direct support from, or involvement of, \nthe project. \n \nFurther, the Terminal Evaluation report will identify, where applicable, the barriers and other \nrisks that may prevent further progress towards long- term impacts, and document \nunintended impacts – both positive and negative impacts – of the project and assess the \noverall scope and implications of these impacts. Where these impacts are undesirable from \nenvironmental and socio-economic perspectives, the evaluation will suggest corrective \nactions. \n \n11.3.7. \n Assessment of Monitoring & Evaluation Systems \nIn addition, the Terminal Evaluation report will assess the Monitoring & Evaluation plan and \nimplementation in particular  (6-point scale; Highly Satisfactory to Highly Unsatisfactory) to \nidentify strengths and weaknesses, as well as lessons learned. Our assessment will address \nthe following:  \n• \nDesign: Assess whether the original plan was well-prepared and included sufficient \nbaseline data for monitoring. Assess whether the plan provided clear and appropriate \ntargets across key indicator areas while providing a practical and sufficient plan for \nM&E implementation.  \n• \nImplementation: Compare actual implementation versus the original plan and identify \nand understand discrepancies. Assess whether data was gathered, organised and \nanalyzed following an appropriate methodology. Assess to what effect M&E was \nsupported and how it guided project management and results.  \n \nSpecifically, we will address the following key questions:  \n1.     Was the M&E plan at the point of CEO Endorsement practical and sufficient? \n2.     Did it include baseline data? \n3.     Did the M&E plan: \n\n \n \n56 \n• \nSpecify clear targets and appropriate (SMART) indicators to track \nenvironmental, gender, and socio-economic results; a proper methodological \napproach; \n• \nSpecify practical organization and logistics of the M&E activities including \nschedule and responsibilities for data collection; and, \n• \nProvide an adequate budget? \n \nRegarding implementation: \n1.  Did the M&E system operate as per the M&E plan? \n2.  Where necessary, was the M&E plan revised in a timely manner? \n3.  Was information gathered in a systematic manner? \n4.  Was the analysis of M&E data appropriate? \n5.  Were the resources for M&E sufficient? \n6.  How was the information from the M&E system used during the project \nimplementation? \n \n11.3.8. \nAssessment of Implementation and Execution \nAs mentioned above, the Terminal Evaluation report will include an assessment (6-point \nscale; Highly Satisfactory to Highly Unsatisfactory) of the overall implementation and \nexecution of GEF full-size projects, taking into account the performance of the GEF \nImplementing Agencies and project Executing Agency(ies) (EAs) in discharging their expected \nroles and responsibilities. \n• \nQuality of Implementation: With focus on elements that were controllable from the \ngiven GEF Agency’s perspective, their performance will be evaluated on how \neffectively they delivered on activities related to, inter alia, a project’s identification, \nconcept preparation, appraisal, preparation of the detailed proposal, approval, and \nstart-up, oversight, supervision, completion, and evaluation.  NCA will assess how well \nrisks were identified and managed by the GEF Agency. \n• \nQuality of Execution: EA performance will be assessed on how effectively they \ndischarged their oversight role and responsibilities related to, inter alia, the \nmanagement and administration of the project’s day-to-day activities, the \nappropriate use of funds, and procurement and contracting of goods and services to \nthe GEF Agency. \n• \nAssessment of the Environmental and Social Safeguards: The Terminal Evaluation \nreport will assess whether appropriate environmental and social safeguards were \naddressed in the project’s design and implementation, including mitigation. NCA will \nassess the screening/categorization of the project along with the implementation of \nthe safeguard plans that were approved by the GEF Agency. \n• \nGender: The Terminal Evaluation report will determine the extent to which the \ngender considerations were taken into account in designing and implementing the \nproject (e.g., was a gender analysis conducted; how did the project ensure gender \nequitable participation and benefits; and, did the project gather gender disaggregated \ndata and report on beneficiaries); the report will also document the extent to which \nrelevant gender-related concerns were tracked through project M&E, and if possible, \naddress whether gender considerations contributed to the success [or failure] of the \n\n \n \n57 \nproject. In case the given GEF project disadvantages or may disadvantage women or \nmen, then this will be documented and reported. \n• \nStakeholder Engagement: The Terminal Evaluation report will review, where \napplicable, and assess the Stakeholder Engagement Plan and project-specific aspects \nsuch as involvement of civil society, indigenous population, the private sector, etc. \nThe evaluator should also indicate the percentage of stakeholders interviewed who \nrate as satisfactory, the level at which their views and concerns are taken into account \nby the project. \n• \nAccountability and Grievance Mechanism: The Terminal Evaluation report will review \nand assess the project’s Grievance Mechanism, including document whether project \nstakeholders were aware of the grievance mechanism and whether the mechanism \nwas effective in addressing grievances.  \n \n11.3.9. \nOther Assessments \nThe Terminal Evaluation report will assess the following topics, (ratings will not be provided): \n• \nNeed for follow-up: Recommend any need for follow-up on the evaluation findings. \n• \nMaterialization of co-financing: Report on the extent to which proposed co-financing \nwas secured and administered by the project management. We will also identify how \nany shortfall in co-financing or materialization of greater than expected co-financing \naffected project results, etc. \n• \nLessons and Recommendations: Provide key lessons from good practices across \nproject design, implementation, stakeholder engagement and overall impact. Given \nour in-depth experience with such projects, we will be able to understand and \nidentify the reasons behind project success and setback.  Based on these lessons,  we \nwill make specific recommendations on how to scale up (from local, regional and \nnational levels) the methods for assessing and monitoring land degradation at \nmultiple scales.  We will provide targeted recommendations to the GEF both for \nfurther actions with this project and portfolio-wide. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n58 \nAnnex B: Stakeholders Consulted  \n \nNAME \nINSTITUTION \nROLE \nDATE \n1.

The Terminal Evaluation (TE) is designed to provide a comprehensive and \nsystematic account of the performance of a completed project by assessing its design, \nimplementation, and achievement of objectives. The evaluation is expected to: promote \naccountability and transparency; and facilitate synthesis of lessons. Also, the TE will provide \nfeedback to allow the GEF Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) to identify recurring issues \nacross the GEF portfolio; and, contribute to GEF IEO databases for aggregation and analysis.  \n \nGuidelines for the Evaluator(s): \n• Evaluators will be independent from project design, approval, implementation and \nexecution. Evaluators will familiarize themselves with the GEF programs and \nstrategies, and with relevant GEF policies such as those on project cycle, M&E, co-\nfinancing, fiduciary standards, gender, and environmental and social safeguards.  \n• Evaluators will take perspectives of all relevant stakeholders (including the GEF \nOperational Focal Point[s]) into account. They will gather information on project \nperformance and results from multiple sources including the project M&E system, \ntracking tools, field visits, stakeholder interviews, project documents, and other \nindependent sources, to facilitate triangulation. They will seek the necessary \ncontextual information to assess the significance and relevance of observed \nperformance and results.  \n• Evaluators will be impartial and will present a balanced account consistent with \nevidence.  \n• Evaluators will apply the rating scales provided in these guidelines in Annex 2. \n• Evaluators will abide by the GEF Evaluation Office Ethical Guidelines. \n \nProject Background: \nThe evaluator will review the documents and deliver a terminal evaluation report on the \nfollowing project: \n• Project Title: Strengthening National Capacity in Kenya to Meet the Transparency \nRequirements of the Paris Agreement and Supporting the Coordination of National, \nRegional and Global Transparency-related Activities in Kenya \n• Project Objective: To enhance the SLEEK system in Kenya to ensure Compliance with \nthe Paris Agreement Transparency Requirements \n \nThe project is organized into the following components:  \n \nComponent 1: Strengthening national institutions and capacities in Kenya to enhance MRV \ntransparency in line with Kenya’s national priorities \nKenya’s Second National Communication to the UNFCCC notes that the country needs to \nstrengthen the coordination, networks and information flows between ministries, different \nlevels of government, civil society, academia and the private sector to have a more efficient \n\n \n \n60 \nintegration of climate change variables into poverty reduction and development strategies. \nComponent 1 addresses this gap and takes the bulk of the project resources.  \n \nComponent 2: Supporting enhancements to the System for Land-Based Emission Estimation \nin Kenya (SLEEK) to assist with improvement of transparency over time  \nThe SLEEK system which is driven by five data pillars (climate, soils, forest, crops and land use \nchange) is a strong model in Kenya on addressing land-based issues, including emissions. The \nSLEEK system, together with its generic FLInT design, aims to enable Kenya to generate \nlandbased carbon dioxide emission estimations at tier 3 and come up with tailored MRV \nsystem for the land sector that is country-specific.  \n \nComponent 3: Supporting the enhancement of the coordination between national, regional \nand global transparency related activities in Kenya.  \nThis component will strengthen coordination of national, regional and global \ntransparencyrelated initiatives in Kenya by setting up a coordination platform. The platform \nwill be a combination of web-based information, newsletters, in person meetings and \ncoordinated events to share ideas across the GoK ministries, departments, and professionals. \nThe platform will coordinate the multiple on-going initiatives that continue to be initiated \nfrom various development partners. This will support the Government to ensure that this \nwork is coordinated, reduce costs and highlight which areas need support. It will also ensure \ncoherence and coordination among the relevant departments, ministries, initiatives, and \nfunding entities working toward this goal. In addition, the component will support the \nClimate Change Directorate to put in place a monitoring and review process to provide the \nguidance necessary to shift capacity-building efforts toward sustained and long-term capacity \nresults being built at the institutional and systemic levels. The following two key areas of \nfocus will be at the heart of this component:  \n \nMore information on the project can be found here:  \nhttps://www.thegef.org/project/strengthening-national-capacity-kenya-meet-transparency-\nrequirements-paris-agreement-and \n \nProject Location: Kenya \n \nKey Tasks of the Evaluator(s):  \n1. Based on an approved work plan, the evaluator will conduct a desk review of project \ndocuments (i.e. PIF, Project Document, plans related to the Environmental and Social \nSafeguards [including Gender and Stakeholder Engagement], Work plans, Budgets, \nProject Inception Report, Quarterly Reports, PIRs, documents with project results, \nFinalized GEF Focal Area Tracking Tools, policies and guidelines used by the Executing \nAgency, CI-GEF Evaluation Policy, GEF Evaluation Policy, Project Operational Guidelines, \nManuals and Systems, etc.). \n2. The evaluator will host a workshop (in person/virtual) with the Executing Agencies to \nclarify understanding of the objectives and methods of the Terminal Evaluation.  \n3. The conclusion of the workshop will be summarized in a Terminal Evaluation Zero Report \nwith the following information:   \na) Identification of the subject of the review, and relevant context \n\n \n \n61 \nb) Purpose of the evaluation: why is the evaluation being conducted at this time, who \nneeds the information and why? \nc) Objectives of the evaluation: What the evaluation aims to achieve (e.g. assessment of \nthe results of the project, etc.) \nd) Scope: What aspects of the project will be covered, and not covered, by the \nevaluation \ne) Identification and description of the evaluation criteria (including relevance, \neffectiveness, results, efficiency, and sustainability) \nf) Key evaluation questions \ng) Methodology including approach for data collection and analysis, and stakeholder \nengagement \nh) Rationale for selection of the methods, and selection of data sources (i.e. sites to be \nvisited, stakeholders to be interviewed) \ni) System for data management and maintenance of records \nj) Intended products and reporting procedures \nk) Potential limitations of the evaluation \n4. The evaluator will undertake the evaluation of the project, including any interviews and \nin- country site visits. \n5. Based on the document review and the in-country interviews/site visits, the evaluator will \nprepare a draft evaluation report following the outline in Annex 1. The report will be \nshared with the Executing Agencies and the CI-GEF Agency. Each party can provide a \nmanagement response, documenting questions or comments on the draft evaluation \nreport. \n6. The evaluator will incorporate comments and will prepare the final evaluation report. The \nevaluator will submit a final evaluation report in word and PDF and will include a separate \ndocument highlighting where/how comments were incorporated.  \n \nDeliverables: \nThe successful offeror shall deliver to CI the final Terminal Evaluation Report, in accordance \nwith the outline in Annex 1.  \n \nDeliverables Schedule: \nNumber Activity \nResponsible \nDeliverable \nDue Date \n1 \nEstablish work plan \nConsultant \nApproved work plan \nTo be \ndetermined \n2 \nDesk review of all \nrelevant project \ndocuments \nConsultant \nConsultants \nunderstands project \nand can deliver a \nEvaluation Inception \nWorkshop as \noutlined in \nDeliverable #3.  \nTo be \ncompleted \nbefore \nEvaluation \nInception \nWorkshop \n\n \n \n62 \n3 \nHost Evaluation \nInception workshop \nwith Executing \nAgencies (virtual/in \nperson) \nConsultant \nTerminal Evaluation \nZero Report \nTo be \ndetermined \n4 \nEvaluation of the \nproject via interviews \nand site visits \nConsultant \nDraft evaluation \nreport based on \noutline in Annex 1 \nTo be \ndetermined \n5 \nReview draft \nevaluation report \nExecuting \nagencies and \nCI-GEF \nAgency \nProvide comments \nor questions  \nTo be \ndetermined \n6 \nIncorporate comments \ninto evaluation report \nConsultant \nFinal Terminal \nEvaluation Report \n(word and PDF), \nincluding document \nshowing how \ncomments/questions \nwere incorporated \nTo be \ndetermined \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n63 \n \nAnnex D: Outline for Draft and Terminal Evaluation Reports \nThe draft and final evaluation reports should at the minimum contain the information below: \n \nGeneral Information \nThe Terminal Evaluation report will provide general information on the project and conduct \nof the Terminal Evaluation. This includes information such as: \n• GEF Project ID \n• Project name \n• GEF financing \n• Planned and materialized co-financing \n• Key objectives \n• GEF Agency \n• Project countries \n• Key dates: Date of project start, Date of project completion \n• Name of the Project Executing Agency(ies) \n \nThe Terminal Evaluation report will also provide information on when the evaluation took \nplace, places visited, who was involved, the methodology, and the limitations of the \nevaluation. The report will also include, as annexes to the main report, the evaluation team’s \nterms of reference, its composition and expertise. \n \nWhere feasible and appropriate, the Terminal Evaluation reports should include \ngeoreferenced maps and/or coordinates that demarcate the planned and actual area \ncovered by the project. To facilitate tracking and verification, where feasible, the Terminal \nEvaluations should include geo-referenced pictures of the sites where GEF supported \ninterventions were undertaken. \n \nProject Theory of Change \nThe Terminal Evaluation report will include a description of the project’s theory of change \nincluding description of the outputs, outcomes, intermediate states, and intended long-term \nenvironmental impacts of the project; the causal pathways for the long-term impacts; and, \nimplicit and explicit assumptions.  \nThe project’s objective(s) should also be included within the theory of change. Some of the \nprojects may already have an explicit theory of change. Where appropriate, after \nconsultations with the project stakeholders, the evaluators may refine this theory of change. \nWhere an explicit theory of change is not provided in the project documents, the evaluators \nshould develop it based on information provided in the project documents and through \nconsultations with the project stakeholders. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n64 \n \nAssessment of Project Results \nThe TE must assess achievement of project outputs and outcomes, and report on these. \nWhile assessing a project’s results, evaluators will determine and rate the extent to which the \nproject objectives – as stated in the documents submitted at the CEO Endorsement stage – \nhave been achieved. The evaluator(s) should also indicate if there were any changes in \nproject design and/or expected results after start of implementation. If the project did not \nestablish a baseline (initial conditions), where feasible, the evaluator should estimate the \nbaseline conditions so that results can be determined. Where applicable, the Terminal \nEvaluation report will include an assessment of the level of achievement of the GEF \ncorporate results targets to which the project contributes and will also incorporate data from \nthe focal area tracking tool. \n \nOutputs \nThe evaluator should rate the extent to which the expected outputs were actually delivered. \nAn identification and assessment of the factors that affected delivery of outputs should also \nbe included.  \n \nOutcomes \nThe evaluator should rate the extent to which the expected outcomes were achieved and the \nextent to which its achievement was dependent on delivery of project outputs. They should \nalso assess the factors that affected outcome achievement, e.g. project design, project’s \nlinkages with other activities, extent and materialization of co-financing, stakeholder \ninvolvement, etc. Where the project was developed within the framework of a program, the \nassessment should also report on the extent the project contributed to the program \noutcomes.  \n \nCriteria for Outcome Ratings \nOutcome ratings will take into account the outcome achievements of the projects against its \nexpected targets. Project outcomes will be rated on three dimensions: a. Relevance: Were \nthe project outcomes congruent with the GEF focal areas/operational program strategies, \ncountry priorities, and mandates of the Agencies? Was the project design appropriate for \ndelivering the expected outcomes? b. Effectiveness: Were the project’s actual outcomes \ncommensurate with the expected outcomes? c. Efficiency: Was the project cost-effective? \nHow does the project cost/time versus output/outcomes equation compare to that of similar \nprojects? Rating Scale for Outcomes: An overall outcome rating will be provided on a six-\npoint scale (highly satisfactory to highly unsatisfactory) after taking into account outcome \nrelevance, effectiveness, and efficiency (See Annex 2).  \n \nSustainability  \nThe assessment of sustainability will weigh risks to continuation of benefits from the project. \nThe assessment should identify key risks and explain how these risks may affect continuation \nof benefits after the GEF project ends. The analysis should cover financial, socio-political, \ninstitutional, and environmental risks. The overall sustainability of project outcomes will be \n\n \n \n65 \nrated on a four-point scale (Likely to Unlikely) based on an assessment of the likelihood and \nmagnitude of the risks to sustainability. Higher levels of risks and magnitudes of effect, imply \nlower likelihood of sustainability. Annex 2 describes the rating scale for sustainability. \n \nProgress to Impact \nThe evaluators should also assess the extent to which the progress towards long-term impact \nmay be attributed to the project. The evaluators should report the available qualitative and \nquantitative evidence on environmental stress reduction (e.g. GHG emission reduction, \nreduction of waste discharge, etc.) and environmental status change (e.g. change in \npopulation of endangered species, forest stock, water retention in degraded lands, etc.). \nWhen reporting such evidence, the evaluator should note the information source and clarify \nthe scale/s at which the described environmental stress reduction is being achieved.  \n \nThe evaluators should cover the project’s contributions to changes in policy/ legal/regulatory \nframeworks. This would include observed changes in capacities (awareness, knowledge, skills, \ninfrastructure, monitoring systems, etc.) and governance architecture, including access to \nand use of information (laws, administrative bodies, trust-building and conflict resolution \nprocesses, information-sharing systems, etc.). Contribution to change in socioeconomic \nstatus (income, health, well-being, etc.) should also be documented.  \n \nWhere the environmental and social changes are being achieved at scales beyond the \nimmediate area of intervention, the evaluators should provide an account of the processes \nsuch as sustaining, mainstreaming, replication, scaling up and market change, through which \nthese changes have taken place. The evaluators should discuss whether there are \narrangements in the project design to facilitate follow-up actions, and should document \ninstances where the GEF promoted approaches, technologies, financing instruments, legal \nframeworks, information systems, etc., were adopted/implemented without direct support \nfrom, or involvement of, the project. Evidence on incidence of these processes should be \ndiscussed to assess progress towards impact. When assessing contributions of GEF project to \nthe observed change, the evaluators should also assess the contributions of other actors and \nfactors.  \n \nThe evaluators should assess merits of rival explanations for the observed impact and give \nreasons for accepting or rejecting them. Where applicable, the evaluators are encouraged to \nidentify and describe the barriers and other risks that may prevent further progress towards \nlong-term impacts.  \n \nThe evaluators should document the unintended impacts – both positive and negative \nimpacts – of the project and assess the overall scope and implications of these impacts. \nWhere these impacts are undesirable from environmental and socio-economic perspectives, \nthe evaluation should suggest corrective actions.  \n \nAssessment of Monitoring & Evaluation Systems  \nThe evaluators will include an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the project \nM&E plan and its implementation.  \nM&E Design. To assess the quality of the M&E plan, the evaluators will assess:  \n\n \n \n66 \na. Was the M&E plan at the point of CEO Endorsement practical and sufficient?  \nb. Did it include baseline data?  \nc. Did it: specify clear targets and appropriate (SMART) indicators to track \nenvironmental, gender, and socio-economic results; a proper methodological \napproach; specify practical organization and logistics of the M&E activities \nincluding schedule and responsibilities for data collection; and, budget \nadequate funds for M&E activities?  \nM&E Implementation. The evaluators should assess:  \na. Whether the M&E system operated as per the M&E plan?  \nb. Where necessary, whether the M&E plan was revised in a timely manner?  \nc. Was information on specified indicators and relevant GEF focal area tracking \ntools gathered in a systematic manner?  \nd. Whether appropriate methodological approaches have been used to analyze \ndata?  \ne. Were resources for M&E sufficient? How was the information from the M&E \nsystem used during the project implementation?  \n \nProject M&E systems will be rated on the quality of M&E design and quality of M&E \nimplementation using a six-point scale (Highly Satisfactory to Highly Unsatisfactory). Annex 2 \nprovides more details on the scale. \n \nAssessment of Implementation and Execution \nThe assessment of the implementation and execution of GEF full size projects will take into \naccount the performance of the GEF Implementing Agencies and project Executing \nAgency(ies) (EAs) in discharging their expected roles and responsibilities. The performance of \nthese agencies will be rated using a six-point scale (Highly Satisfactory to Highly \nUnsatisfactory). See Annex 2 for more information on the scale.  \n \nQuality of Implementation: Within the GEF partnership, GEF Implementing Agencies are \ninvolved in activities related to a project’s identification, concept preparation, appraisal, \npreparation of detailed proposal, approval and start-up, oversight, supervision, completion, \nand evaluation. To assess performance of the GEF Agencies, the evaluators will assess the \nextent to which the agency delivered effectively on these counts, with focus on elements \nthat were controllable from the given GEF Agency’s perspective. The evaluator will assess \nhow well risks were identified and managed by the GEF Agency.  \n \nQuality of Execution: Within the GEF partnership, the EAs are involved in the management \nand administration of the project’s day-to-day activities under the overall oversight and \nsupervision of the GEF Agencies. The EAs are responsible for the appropriate use of funds, \nand procurement and contracting of goods and services to the GEF Agency. To assess EA \nperformance, the evaluators will assess the extent to which it effectively discharged its role \nand responsibilities.  \n \nAssessment of the Environmental and Social Safeguards \nThe evaluator will assess whether appropriate environmental and social safeguards were \naddressed in the project’s design and implementation (See Annex 2 for more details on the \n\n \n \n67 \nrating scale). It is expected that a GEF project will not cause any harm to environment or to \nany stakeholder and, where applicable, it will take measures to prevent and/or mitigate \nadverse effects. The evaluator should assess the screening/categorization of the project \nalong with the implementation of the safeguard plans that were approved by the GEF \nAgency.  \n \nGender: The evaluator will determine the extent to which the gender considerations were \ntaken into account in designing and implementing the project. The evaluator should report \nwhether a gender analysis was conducted, the extent to which the project was implemented \nin a manner that ensures gender equitable participation and benefits, and whether gender \ndisaggregated data was gathered and reported on beneficiaries. In case the given GEF project \ndisadvantages or may disadvantage women or men, then this should be documented and \nreported. The evaluator should also determine the extent to which relevant gender related \nconcerns were tracked through project M&E, and if possible, addressing whether gender \nconsiderations contributed to the success of the project.  \n \nStakeholder Engagement: The evaluator should, where applicable, review and assess the \nStakeholder Engagement Plan and project specific aspects such as involvement of civil \nsociety, indigenous population, private sector, etc. The evaluator should also indicate the \npercentage of stakeholders who rate as satisfactory, the level at which their views and \nconcerns are taken into account by the project. \n \nAccountability and Grievance Mechanism: The evaluator should review and assess the \nproject’s Grievance Mechanism. The evaluator should analyze and assess whether project \nstakeholders were aware of the grievance mechanism and whether the mechanism was \neffective in addressing grievances.  \n  \nThe evaluator should also review and assess any other safeguard plans that were triggered.  \n \nOther Assessments \nThe Terminal Evaluations should assess the following topics, for which ratings are not \nrequired:  \na. Need for follow-up: Where applicable, the evaluators will indicate if there is any need \nto follow up on the evaluation findings, e.g. instances financial mismanagement, \nunintended negative impacts or risks, etc.  \nb. Materialization of co-financing: the evaluators will provide information on the extent \nto which expected co-financing materialized, whether co-financing is cash or in-kind, \nwhether it is in form of grant or loan or equity, whether co-financing was \nadministered by the project management or by some other organization, how \nshortfall in co-financing or materialization of greater than expected co-financing \naffected project results, etc.  \nc. Lessons and Recommendations: Evaluators should provide a few well-formulated \nlessons that are based on the project experience and applicable to the type of project \nat hand, to the GEF’s overall portfolio, and/or to GEF systems and processes. \nWherever possible, Terminal Evaluation reports should include examples of good \npractices in project design and implementation that have led to effective stakeholder \n\n \n \n68 \nengagement, successful broader adoption of GEF initiatives by stakeholders, and \nlarge-scale environmental impacts. The evaluators should describe aspects of the \nproject performance that worked well along with reasons for it. They should discuss \nwhere these good practices may or may not be replicated. Recommendations should \nbe well formulated and targeted. The recommendations should discuss the need for \naction, the recommended action along with its likely consequences vis-à-vis status \nquo and other courses of action, the specific actor/actors that need to take the \naction, and time frame for it.  \n \n \nAnnex 2: Rating Scale \nThe main dimensions of project performance on which ratings are first provided in the \nterminal evaluation are: outcomes, sustainability, quality of monitoring and evaluation, \nquality of implementation, and quality of execution. The CI-GEF Agency also includes ratings \nfor environmental and social safeguards.  \n \nOutcome Ratings: \nThe overall ratings on the outcomes of the project will be based on performance on the \nfollowing criteria:  \na. Relevance  \nb. Effectiveness  \nc. Efficiency  \n \nProject outcomes are rated based on the extent to which project objectives were achieved. A \nsix-point rating scale is used to assess overall outcomes:  \n• Highly satisfactory (HS): Level of outcomes achieved clearly exceeds expectations \nand/or there were no short comings.  \n• Satisfactory (S): Level of outcomes achieved was as expected and/or there were no or \nminor short comings.  \n• Moderately Satisfactory (MS): Level of outcomes achieved more or less as expected \nand/or there were moderate short comings.  \n• Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU): Level of outcomes achieved somewhat lower than \nexpected and/or there were significant shortcomings.  \n• Unsatisfactory (U): Level of outcomes achieved substantially lower than expected \nand/or there were major short comings.  \n• Highly Unsatisfactory (HU): Only a negligible level of outcomes achieved and/or there \nwere severe short comings.  \n• Unable to Assess (UA): The available information does not allow an assessment of the \nlevel of outcome achievements.  \n \nThe calculation of the overall outcomes rating of projects will consider all the three criteria, \nof which relevance and effectiveness are critical. The rating on relevance will determine \nwhether the overall outcome rating will be in the unsatisfactory range (MU to HU = \nunsatisfactory range). If the relevance rating is in the unsatisfactory range, then the overall \noutcome will be in the unsatisfactory range as well. However, where the relevance rating is in \n\n \n \n69 \nthe satisfactory range (HS to MS), the overall outcome rating could, depending on its \neffectiveness and efficiency rating, be either in the satisfactory range or in the unsatisfactory \nrange.  \n \nThe second constraint applied is that the overall outcome achievement rating may not be \nhigher than the effectiveness rating. During project implementation, the results framework \nof some projects may have been modified. In cases where modifications in the project \nimpact, outcomes and outputs have not scaled down their overall scope, the evaluator \nshould assess outcome achievements based on the revised results framework. In instances \nwhere the scope of the project objectives and outcomes has been scaled down, the \nmagnitude of and necessity for downscaling is taken into account and despite achievement \nof results as per the revised results framework, where appropriate, a lower outcome \neffectiveness rating may be given.  \n \nSustainability Ratings: \nThe sustainability will be assessed taking into account the risks related to financial, socio-\npolitical, institutional, and environmental sustainability of project outcomes. The evaluator \nmay also take other risks into account that may affect sustainability. The overall sustainability \nwill be assessed using a four-point scale.  \n• Likely (L): There is little or no risk to sustainability. \n• Moderately Likely (ML): There are moderate risks to sustainability.  \n• Moderately Unlikely (MU): There are significant risks to sustainability.  \n• Unlikely (U): There are severe risks to sustainability.  \n• Unable to Assess (UA): Unable to assess the expected incidence and magnitude of \nrisks to sustainability.  \n \nProject M&E Ratings: \nQuality of project M&E will be assessed in terms of:  \n• Design  \n• Implementation  \n \nQuality of M&E on these two dimensions will be assessed on a six-point scale:  \n• Highly satisfactory (HS): There were no short comings and quality of M&E design / \nimplementation exceeded expectations.  \n• Satisfactory (S): There were no or minor short comings and quality of M&E design / \nimplementation meets expectations.  \n• Moderately Satisfactory (MS): There were some short comings and quality of M&E \ndesign/implementation more or less meets expectations.  \n• Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU): There were significant shortcomings and quality of \nM&E design/implementation somewhat lower than expected.  \n• Unsatisfactory (U): There were major short comings and quality of M&E \ndesign/implementation substantially lower than expected.  \n• Highly Unsatisfactory (HU): There were severe short comings in M&E design/ \nimplementation. \n\n \n \n70 \n• Unable to Assess (UA): The available information does not allow an assessment of the \nquality of M&E design/implementation.  \n \nImplementation and Execution Rating:  \nQuality of implementation and of execution will be rated separately. Quality of \nimplementation pertains to the role and responsibilities discharged by the GEF Agencies that \nhave direct access to GEF resources. Quality of Execution pertains to the roles and \nresponsibilities discharged by the country or regional counterparts that received GEF funds \nfrom the GEF Agencies and executed the funded activities on ground. The performance will \nbe rated on a six-point scale.  \n• Highly satisfactory (HS): There were no short comings and quality of environmental \nand social safeguard plans design/implementation exceeded expectations.  \n• Satisfactory (S): There were no or minor short comings and quality of environmental \nand social safeguard plans design/execution met expectations.  \n• Moderately Satisfactory (MS): There were some short comings and quality of \nenvironmental and social safeguard plans design/implementation more or less met \nexpectations.  \n• Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU): There were significant shortcomings and quality of \nenvironmental and social safeguard plans design/implementation somewhat lower \nthan expected.  \n• Unsatisfactory (U): There were major short comings and quality of environmental and \nsocial safeguard plans design/implementation substantially lower than expected.  \n• Highly Unsatisfactory (HU): There were severe short comings in quality of \nenvironmental and social safeguard plans design/implementation \n• Unable to Assess (UA): The available information does not allow an assessment of the \nquality of environmental and social safeguard plans design/implementation \n \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguards: \nThe approved environmental and social safeguard plans will be rated according to the \nfollowing scale.  \n \n• Highly satisfactory (HS): There were no short comings and quality of implementation / \nexecution exceeded expectations.  \n• Satisfactory (S): There were no or minor short comings and quality of implementation \n/ execution meets expectations.  \n• Moderately Satisfactory (MS): There were some short comings and quality of \nimplementation / execution more or less meets expectations.  \n• Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU): There were significant shortcomings and quality of \nimplementation / execution somewhat lower than expected.  \n• Unsatisfactory (U): There were major short comings and quality of implementation / \nexecution substantially lower than expected.  \n• Highly Unsatisfactory (HU): There were severe short comings in quality of \nimplementation / execution.  \n• Unable to Assess (UA): The available information does not allow an assessment of the \nquality of implementation / execution. \n\n \n \n71 \nAnnex E: Evaluation Team Biographies \n \nArthur Blundell PhD, Founder and partner at Natural Capital Advisor. \nArt has over 25 years experience in natural resource management with a focus on project \ndesign and evaluation working with USAID, multi-laterals, and foundations.

To operationalize the\nNCCRS, Kenya prepared the National Climate\nChange Action Plan 2013-2017 (NCCAP).\nThe NCCAP views climate change as a\ncrosscutting issue to be mainstreamed in\nnational planning and development processes,\nand in policy decisions across all sectors of the\neconomy.\nThe\nNCCAP\nsets\nout\npriority\nadaptation and mitigation actions that will help\nKenya move toward a low carbon climate\nresilient\ndevelopment\npathway.\nEffective\nimplementation will be supported through the\nestablishment of an enabling governance\nstructure including a climate change policy and\nlaw, a funding mechanism and investment\nframework,\na\ncapacity\ndevelopment\nand\nmanagement framework, and a national a\nnational\nperformance\nand\nbenefit\nmeasurement system.\n\nThe Ministry of Planning and Devolution\n(MOPD) has included indicators to track\nprogress in mainstreaming climate change in its\nSecond Handbook of National Reporting, which\nhelps the government monitor progress toward\nthe goals of the Second Medium Term Plan of\nVision 2030.\n\nA Climate Change Bill is expected to be enacted\ninto law in 2015. This Bill includes establishment\nof a National Climate Change Council that has\nresponsibility for coordination of climate\nchange\nactions,\nincluding\nmainstreaming\n\nThe Government of Kenya has moved to\nimplement a number of actions in the NCCAP,\nincluding improved drought management and\npromotion of renewable energy.\n\nKey policies containing measures to\nmainstream climate change\nOther relevant national policies and legislation\nthat\ncontain\nmeasures\nthat\nenable\nmainstreaming of climate change are included\nin Table 2 below.\n\nTable 2: Key National Policies and Initiatives\nPolicies\nMeasures to mainstream climate change\nConstitution of Kenya\n(2010)\nA clean and health environment (Articles 42, 69 and 70) is a fundamental right\nunder the Bill of Rights. The Constitution establishes the right to food security\nwhile emphasizing sustainable and productive management of land and natural\nresources, such as a goal of tree cover of 10 per cent of the country’s land area.\nVision 2030 (2008)\nEncapsulates flagship programmes and projects with aspects of adaptation\nand mitigation.\nNational Policy for the\nSustainable Development of\nNorthern Kenya and other\nArid Lands (2012)\nFocuses on climate resilience requiring government to find solutions to address\nclimate challenges and to come up with measures to manage drought and\nstrengthen livelihoods.\nNational Disaster\nManagement Policy, 2012\nAims to increase and sustain resilience of vulnerable communities to hazards.\nEnvironmental Management\nand Coordination Act (1999)\nProvides the framework for the management of the environment.\nKenya Forestry Master Plan\n(1995-2020)\n\nRecognises the environmental role of forests including water values, biodiversity\nvalues, climate change values through carbon sequestration and other\nenvironmental services.\nWater Act (2002)\nProvides the overall governance of the sector, and recognises the climate change\nimplications on health, sanitation and water.\n\n 11\n\nAgricultural Sector\nDevelopment Strategy (20102020)\nProvides framework for transforming agriculture into a modern and\ncommercially viable sector. Notes that addressing food security will require\naddressing the challenge of over-dependence on rain fed agriculture.\nEnergy Policy and Act (2004)\n\nEncourages implementation of indigenous renewable energy sources to enhance\nthe country’s electricity supply capacity. The policy is implemented through the\nEnergy Act of 2006, which provides for mitigation of climate change, through\nenergy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy.\nIntegrated National\nTransport Policy (2010)\nProvides for transport solutions that have relevance to climate change\nmitigation\n\nTechnology Transfer\nKenya’s climate change technology needs are\ndiverse and their deployment requires a range\nof activities. Kenya has undertaken two\nTechnology Needs Assessments (TNAs), in 2005\nand 2013. The latter prioritised Environmental\nSustainable\nTechnology\n(EST)\nneeds\nfor\nmitigation and adaptation and developed their\ntechnology action plans (TAPs). The TNAs\ndetermined that priority technologies have high\nsocio-economic or sustainable development\nbenefits, and target the energy, waste,\nagriculture\nand\nwater\nsectors\nin\nrural\ncommunities. The key technologies are: solar\nhome systems, solar dryers, bio-digesters,\ndrought resistant sorghum, roof-surface water\nharvesting and drip irrigation.\n\nThe priority technologies have been deployed\nKenya, yet widespread diffusion has been\nlimited by such barriers as:\n\nx High cost of purchase, installation and\nmaintenance\nx Weak policies and lack of standards\nx Limited information and awareness.\nSuccessful diffusion requires robust outreach\nand awareness raising through training and\nknowledge transfer systems.\n\nResearch and Systematic Observation\nVarious\ninstitutions\nin\nKenya\nundertake\nsystematic observation and coordinate climate\nand climate change-related research activities\nand programmes in the country. The Kenya\nMeteorology Department (KMD), working\nclosely with Africa’s IGAD Climate Prediction\nand Applications Centre (ICPAC) and the\nInstitute for Meteorological Training and\nResearch (IMTR), has the overall mandate to\ncarry out climate and climate change-related\nresearch. The country hosts a number of\nobservational\nstations\nand\nan\nextensive\ncommunication network covering a Regional\nTelecommunications Hub (RTH) that collects\nobservational data originating from its own and\nassociated National Meteorological Centres\n(NMCs) and relaying such data directly to the\nglobal\nMain\nTelecommunication\nNetwork\n(MTN). Despite Kenya’s extensive observational\nnetwork, a lean meteorological budget means\nthat quantity and quality are considered\ninadequate to cover the country effectively.\nClimate monitoring networks in the ASALs – an\narea with high need - are extremely limited.\nFunding is required to establish an adequate\nobservational infrastructure.\n\nEducation, Training and Public Awareness\nClimate\nchange\nissues\nreceive\nminimal\nconsideration in Kenya’s formal education\nsystem. The level of awareness of climate\nchange issues and impact is low across the\ncountry. The NCCAP recommends increasing\nawareness and mainstreaming of climate\nchange issues in education curriculum, but\naction in this area has not progressed. In\naddition, high quality scientific research is\nneeded to update available knowledge and\nbuild confidence in mainstreaming climate\nchange information in decision making. The\n\n 12\n\nMENR is in the process of developing a Climate\nInformation Centre, which is expected to begin\nto fill information gaps when operational.\n\nCapacity Building\nNumerous capacity building initiatives in\nclimate change have been undertaken in Kenya,\nincluding through the GEF and the UNDP Low\nEmission Capacity Building programme. The\nareas\nof\nfocus\ninclude:\ninstitutional\nstrengthening; establishment of national focal\npoints; national climate change programmes;\ngreenhouse gas inventories; and vulnerability\nand adaptation assessments, amongst others.\nThe NCCAP recommended the development of\na National Framework for Climate Knowledge\nManagement and Capacity Development to\nimprove coordination and implementation of\ncapacity building initiatives.\n\nConstraints,\nGaps\nand\nRelated\nFinancial,\nTechnical and Capacity Needs\nImproved capacity to prepare and improve\nNational\nCommunications\n(NCs)\non\na\ncontinuous basis is a key need. This includes\nimproved monitoring networks and data\ncapture systems. Throughout the second NC\nprocess, and especially during the development\nof the GHG inventory, data availability and\nquality were a major concern.

These are important as they\ndetermine Kenya’s ability to mitigate and adapt\nto climate change while developing sustainably.\nThe chapter starts by providing an overview of\nKenya’s government structure and includes\nbrief descriptions of the country’s geographic\nand climatic characteristics. This is followed up\nwith the current status, prospects and plans for\nthe different environmental, economic and\nsocial\nsectors\nwithin\nthe\ncountry.\nThe\ninformation\nincludes\nindication\nof\nany\nassociated\nclimate\nchange\nimpacts,\nvulnerabilities, and risks and including brief\nreviews of a sector contribution to GHG\nemissions if of significance and where data is\navailable. It culminates with details on the\ncountry’s environmental and climate change\ngovernance.\nGOVERNMENT PROFILE\n\nThe Republic of Kenya (hereinafter referred to\nas ‘Kenya’) is a unitary State with a multi-party\npolitical system. Kenya became independent on\n12 December 1963 as a multi-party state,\nbecoming a one party state in 1982 and\nreverting back to multi-partism in 1992. In\n2010, the Government of Kenya (GoK) enacted\na new constitution (hereinafter referred to as\n‘the Constitution’) which created a devolved\ntwo tier government consisting of a national\ngovernment and county governments. The new\ngovernment\nstructure\ncame\ninto\neffect\nfollowing a general election in March 2013.\nThe Constitution and the new government\nstructure has brought in 47 constitutionally\nautonomous county governments that have\ndefined spheres of power and functions; a\nbicameral legislature;2 separation of powers\nbetween the three arms of government (the\nExecutive, Legislature and Judiciary) and more\nstringent requirements for transparency and\naccountability for holders of public office at all\nlevels.\n\nThe established devolution plays a major role in\nservice\ndelivery\nthrough\nthe\nCounty\nGovernments Act, 20123. The Act states that a\ncounty\ngovernment\nshall\nplan\nwithin\na\nframework that integrates economic, physical,\nsocial, environmental and spatial planning. The\nframework protects and develop natural\nresources in a manner that aligns national and\ncounty government policies. As such while the\nGoK has overall responsibility for ensuring that\nprogrammes are put in place to deliver its\nobligations\nunder\nthe\nUnited\nNations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), all the administrations under the\nnational and county governments play a part in\nmeeting this through the policies available to\nthem.\nClimate\nchange,\nbecause\nof\nits\ncrosscutting and multi-sectoral nature, is a\nfunction\nof\nthe\nnational\nand\ncounty\ngovernments\nand\nrequires\nconcurrent\njurisdiction\nacross\nboth\nlevels.\nFurther\ninformation\nabout\nthe\ninstitutional\narrangements\nand\nresponsibilities\nfor\nenvironment and climate related policies, plans\nand strategies is set out in Section IX below.\nIn July 2008, Kenya launched Vision 2030, the\nnational long-term development blueprint. It\naims to transform Kenya into a newly\nindustrialising,\nmiddle-income\ncountry\nproviding a high quality of life to all its citizens\nby 2030, in a clean and secure environment.\nVision 2030 is comprised of economic, social\nand political pillars. The economic pillar seeks to\nimprove the prosperity of all regions of the\ncountry and all Kenyans by achieving an average\n10 per cent Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\ngrowth rate per annum beginning in 2012. The\nsocial pillar seeks to create just, cohesive and\nequitable social development, in a clean and\nsecure environment, through investment in the\npeople of Kenya and improvement of the\nquality of life for all Kenyans. The political pillar\n\n 16\n\naims to realise an issue-based, people-centred,\nresult-oriented and accountable democratic\nsystem. The three pillars are anchored on the\nfoundations of macroeconomic stability which\ninclude infrastructural development, science,\ntechnology and innovation, land reforms,\nhuman resources development, security and\npublic sector reforms.\nVision 2030 is implemented in successive five\nyear Medium-Term Plans (MTP), through a\nnumber of flagship projects. The first MTP\ncovered the period 2008 – 2012 and the second\nMTP covers the period 2013-2017. Kenya’s\nresponse as a signatory of the UNFCCC has\nincluded preparation of the First National\nCommunication (FNC) in 2002, development of\nthe National Climate Change Response Strategy\n(NCCRS) in 2010, launch of the National Climate\nChange Action Plan (NCCAP) in 2013 and\nsubmission of a Climate Change Bill to\nParliament\nin\n2014.\nThe\nMinistry\nof\nEnvironment and Natural Resources (MENR) has\ndesignated a Climate Change Secretariat to\nguide its climate change response, and several\nsectoral ministries have designated climate\nchange units.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL PROFILE\nLocation\nKenya, which is almost bisected by the Equator,\nextends between latitudes 5oN and 5oS and\nlongitudes 34oE and 42oE. It is bordered by\nSouth Sudan and Ethiopia to the north, Uganda\nto the west, Somalia to the east, Tanzania to\nthe southwest and Indian Ocean to the\nsoutheast (Figure 5). It spans a territorial area of\n582,646 km2 consisting of 11,230 km2 of water\nsurface and 571,416 km2 land area. Of the total\nland area, approximately 490,000 km2 (about 85\nper cent) is classified as arid and semi-arid land\n(ASALs).4,5\n\nFigure 5: Map of Kenya\n\nSource: Commission on Revenue Allocation (CRA) - 2013; Government of Kenya\n\n 17\n\nTopography\n\nKenya’s landscape relief stretches from sea\nlevel to about 5,200m above sea level at the\npeak of Mount Kenya.6 Its topography is\ndescribed as simple and diverse. The simplicity\nis due to its relief being easily separated into\nlowlands and uplands while termed diverse\nbecause of its varied landforms types which are\ndivided into plains, escarpments, hills with low\nand high mountains and breaks.7 Figure 6 shows\nthat from the coastline in the southeast, one\ncomes to a narrow low-lying plain. The altitude\nthen gradually changes to low plateaus, mainly\nof semi-arid nature that spread in the eastern\nand northern parts of the country and sparsely\npopulated. From the low plateaus the terrain\nruns to an elevated plateau and mountain\nregion in the southwest (forming the Kenyan\nhighlands).\n\nFigure 6: Topography of Kenya\n\nSource: Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThe highlands contain the bulk of the country's\npopulation and farmland. The highlands are\ncool and agriculturally rich. Both large and\nsmall-holder farming is carried out here. Major\ncash crops are tea, coffee, flowers, vegetables,\npyrethrum, wheat and maize. Livestock farming\nis also practised. Much of the highlands lie\n1,500 to 3,000 m above sea level and are dotted\nby extinct volcanoes. The Great Rift Valley\nbisects the highlands into east and west forming\na steep sided trench of 30 to 40 miles (48 to 64\nkm) wide and 600 to 900 m deep.8 Mount\nKenya the highest mountain in the country is\nfound on the eastern side while Mount Elgon is\nto the western side on the border of Kenya and\nUganda.\n\nCLIMATIC PROFILE\nKenya’s climate varies considerably across the\ncountry. It is hot and humid at the coast,\ntemperate inland, and very dry in the north and\nnortheast parts of the country. The climate is\nheavily influenced by its variable topography\nand the N-S migration of zonal arm of the Inter\nTropical\nConvergence\nZone\n(ITCZ).\nIts\ngeographic location also makes the country\n\n 18\n\nprone to cyclical droughts and floods with\nclimate change expected to make such types of\nclimate driven events increase in intensity and\nfrequency.\n\nTemperature\n\nKenya’s temperatures vary dramatically, with\nthe highlands experiencing considerably cooler\ntemperatures than the coastal and lowland\nregions.\nAccording\nto\nthe\nclimate\nrisk\nassessment undertaken during the NCCAP -\nobserved temperature data for the country\nshows a distinct warming trend. Observed\nclimate data for Kenya shows a distinct\nwarming trend since the 1960s.9 From the early\n1960s,\nKenya\nhas\nexperienced\ngenerally\nincreasing temperature trends over vast areas.\nOver the inland areas, the trends in both\nminimum (night/early morning) and maximum\n(daytime) temperatures depict a general\nwarming (increasing) trend with time. However,\nthe increase in the minimum temperatures is\nsteeper than in maximum temperatures. The\nresult of the steeper increase in Tmin and a less\nsteep increase Tmax is a reduction in the\ndiurnal temperature range (difference between\nthe maximum and minimum temperatures) –\nFigures 34-39 depict these trends for some\nselected\nrepresentative\nlocations\nin\nthe\ncountry. (Refer to Figures 33-38 in Chapter 3;\nClimate Change Scenarios; Present Climate\nChange (Trends and Baseline) from page 98.)\n\nTemperatures in Kenya, since 1960, have\nexhibited an incremental trend. The annual\nmean increase has been estimated at 10C with\nan average rate of 0.210C per decade.\n\nTemperature Projections\nThe country’s temperature projections are\nbased on General Circulation Models, (GCMs),\nalso known as Global Climate Models. The A1B\n(medium) scenario described in this SNC is one\nof the four main groups of emissions scenarios\nused by the Intergovernmental Panel on\n\nClimate Change (IPCC). The A1B describes a\nfuture world of very rapid economic growth, a\npopulation that peaks in mid-century and\ndeclines thereafter with a rapid introduction of\nnew and more efficient technologies with\nbalance across all energy sources.\n\nThe\ndata\nindicates\nthat\nthe\nfollowing\ntemperature trends are considered likely,\nrelative to the baseline period 1961-1990:10\n\nx Mean annual temperature is projected to\nincrease by between 0.8 and 1.5°C by the\n2030s and 1.6°C to 2.7°C by the 2060s;\nx An increase is projected in the frequency of\nhot days and hot nights. Projections indicate\nthat hot days could occur on 19-45 per cent of\ndays by the 2060s and 26-69 per cent of days\nby the 2090s. Hot nights are projected to\nincrease more quickly, occurring on 45-75 per\ncent of nights by mid-century and 64-93 per\ncent of nights by the end of the century;\nx Projections suggest a decrease in the number\nof days and nights that are considered ‘cold’\nin the current climate. Cold days and nights\nare expected to become very rare.\n\nUnder the same emissions scenarios GCM\nprojections suggest that there will be no cold\ndays or nights by the 2090s.11\n\nPrecipitation\nKenya’s average annual precipitation is typically\n680 mm, ranging from less than 250 mm in the\nnorthern ASALs areas to about 2,000 mm in the\nwestern region (Figure 7).12 The high rainfall\nzone, which receives more than 1,000 mm of\nannual rainfall is the productive agricultural\nland. It occupies less than 20 per cent of the\ncountry’s land area and carries approximately\n80 per cent of the population.13 The ASALs with\nannual rainfall of less than 750mm occupies\nmore than 80 per cent of the land area, and\nsupport about 20 per cent of Kenya’s\npopulation and 70 per cent of the livestock\nproduction.14\n\n 19\n\nOn an annual basis, precipitation in the country\nis governed primarily by the movement of the\nITCZ which migrates south through Kenya in\nOctober to December and returns northwards\nin March to May. The rainfall distribution,\ntherefore, depicts very strong seasonality The\nITCZ brings wet weather to the region resulting\nto most parts of Kenya having two distinct wet\nperiods(bimodal rainfall distribution): The ‘Long\nRains’ (March to May) and the ‘Short Rains’\n(October to December). The ‘Long Rains’ are\nabundant over most parts of the country and\ncontribute significantly to the annual rainfall\ntotals. The “Short Rains” are more abundant\nand reliable in the South-eastern lowlands and\nparts of the eastern highlands. The two distinct\nrainfall seasons are separated by two dry\nperiods that occur in mid-December to midMarch (hottest and driest period) and June to\nSeptember (cool season) in most areas.\n\nSome areas near large water bodies, receive\nrainfall throughout the year (mean monthly\nrainfall > 50mm for all the twelve months. In\naddition, some areas in western Kenya\nextending to parts of central Rift Valley exhibit a\ntri-modal rainfall distribution (Three peaks) with\nthe third rainfall peak occurring in July/August\nperiod.\n\nFigure 7: Distribution of mean annual rainfall\n\nSource: World Resources Institute (2013)\n\n 20\n\nKenya’s rainfall also varies over longer time\nperiods.15 Annual variation in rainfall is\ninfluenced\nby\nfactors\nsuch\nas\nsurface\ntemperatures patterns of the Indian Ocean and\nthe upper level wind regimes. Warmer than\naverage sea surface temperatures in the\nequatorial eastern and Central Pacific Ocean –\nEl Niño episodes – usually result in above\naverage rainfall in the short rainfall season,\nwhereas colder than average sea surface\ntemperatures in the same region – La Niña\nepisodes – bring depressed (below average)\nrainfall in the same season.16 As the ‘short rains’\nare most affected by the presence of El Niño\nconditions, they account for the majority of the\ninter-annual rainfall variability (estimated at\nabout 74 per cent). 17 Although the current\navailable evidence suggests little overall change\nin precipitation, there is significant geographical\ndiversity in observed rainfall trends. Rainfall\ntrends in Kenya since 1960 have shown the\nfollowing specific characteristics:18\nx Some evidence shows that northern areas of\nthe country have become wetter, and\nsouthern areas drier, although this is subject\nto considerable uncertainty; 19\nx Trends in extreme rainfall events based on\ndaily rainfall data are mixed. They show a\ngenerally increasing trend in the proportion of\nheavy rainfall events;20\nx Trends for one day rainfall maxima and five\nday rainfall maxima also show inconsistent\ntrends;\nx Periodic droughts occur in Kenya relatively\nfrequently. Moderate drought events have\nbeen recorded on average every three to four\nyears and major droughts affect the country\nevery ten years on average. Prolonged\ndroughts have become more common since\n2000.\n\nPrecipitation projections\nGCM data indicates that the following trends\nmay be seen for rainfall in Kenya. The statistics\nare for an A1B (medium) emissions scenario\nunless otherwise stated:21\nx There may be increases in average annual\nrainfall in Kenya by the 2060s. However there\nis considerable model disagreement with a\nrange of projections varying from a 5 per cent\ndecrease to a 17 per cent increase by the\n2030s and no change to a 26 per cent\nincrease by 2060s;\nx The increase in total rainfall is projected to be\nlargest from October to December (-6 mm to\n+29 mm per month by 2030s and 0mm to 30\nmm by the 2060s) and proportional changes\nlargest in January and February (-14 per cent\nto +50 per cent by 2030s and -6 per cent to\n+60 per cent by the 2060s). The broad span of\nprojections indicates high levels of model\ndisagreement;\nx The proportion of annual rainfall that occurs\nin heavy events will increase. The range of\nincrease varies from 2 to 11 per cent by the\n2060s and 2 to 12 per cent by the end of the\ncentury;\nx There is relatively good model agreement\nthat 1 and 5-day rainfall annual maxima will\nincrease. The range of predicted increase for\n5-day events is between 2 to 19mm by the\n2060s and 2mm to 24mm by the end of the\ncentury.\n\nDisasters and extreme climatic events\nMore than 70 per cent of natural disasters in\nKenya result from extreme climatic events22 the\nmost common being floods and droughts.\nRecent major droughts occurred in 1991–1992,\n1995–1996, 1998–2000, 2004–2005 and 2009.23\nMajor floods occurred in 1997/98 and 2006.\nThere are indications that these have intensified\nin recent episodes reflecting a changing climate.\nThe repeated pattern of droughts and floods\nhas large impacts and high economic costs.\nDroughts cost an estimated 8 per cent of GDP\nevery five years24. For instance the 1998 to 2000\ndrought was estimated at US$ 2.8 billion from\nthe loss of crops and livestock, forest fires,\ndamage to fisheries, reduced hydropower\ngeneration, reduced industrial production and\nreduced water supply.25 The impacts of such\nevents are exacerbated by socio-economic\n\n 21\n\ntrends (see Box 1 for a description of flood\ndamage). For example, a significant part of the\nflood damage has been attributed to the\nincrease in population, urbanisation, and value\nassets in flood-prone areas. Changes in the\nterrestrial system, such as deforestation and\nloss of natural floodplain storage, also\n\ncontribute\nto\nincreased\nflooding\nand\ndamage.26The continued annual burden of\nthese events leads to large economic costs\n(possibly as much as $0.5 billion per year,\nequivalent to around two per cent of GDP) and\nreduces long-term growth.27\n\n __________________________________\nPOPULATION PROFILE\n\nKenya is characterised by a rapidly growing\npopulation, rapid urbanisation and increasing\nurban poverty, water scarcity, declining food\nproduction and low resilience to climate\nchange. The combined effects of climate change\nand rapid population growth increase food\ninsecurity, environmental degradation and\npoverty levels in in the country.\nKenya’s population was 37.7 million in the 2009\nnational census, a 9 million person increase\nfrom the 28.7 million reported in the 1999\ncensus. The population is estimated to have\nincreased to 41.8 million in 2013 and is\nprojected to reach 46.7 million by 2017.28 Figure\n8 illustrates this population trend, an increase\nof one million per year.29 This growth is largely a\nresult of past high fertility, which peaked at 8.1\nchildren per woman in 1978 and declined to 4.6\nchildren per woman in 200830. The 2009 census\nreported a population density of 66.4 persons\nper square km in 2009], and this is expected to\nincrease to 80.3 persons per square km by\n2017.31 A high percentage of the population\ndensity is concentrated in the non-ASALs areas\n(about 15 per cent of land area). This puts\npressure\non\nnatural\nresources\ncausing\nsubstantial\nenvironmental\ndegradation,\nparticularly deforestation, and constraining the\ncountry’s\nability\nto\ndevelopment\nin\na\nsustainable\nmanner.\nAddressing\nboth\npopulation growth and climate change should\nbe a top priority.\n\nFigure 8: Population trend, Kenya, 2000-2013\n\nSource: derived from The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data\n\n 22\n\nKenya is in the second stage of general\ndemographic transition models, illustrated in\nFigure 9. This situation is characterised by\ndeclining birth and mortality rates, although the\nbirth rate is higher than the mortality rate\nleading to an increasing ‘youth bulge’.32 Youth\ncomprise about 36 per cent of the national\npopulation but worryingly 61 per cent of them\nremain unemployed.33 The reasons are mainly\nattributed to a lack of vocational or professional\nskills demanded by the job market (about 92\nper\ncent\nfall\nin\nthis\ncategory).34\nThe\nunemployment\nchallenge\nis\nfurther\ncompounded by a low transition to and low\ncompletion rates in secondary education. In\naddition, youth face limited opportunities for\ntechnical and vocational skills training.\n\n Figure 9: Population pyramid for Kenya, 2004 compared with 2009\n\nSource: Derived from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data\n\nA narrowing of the pyramid particularly for 50+\nyears indicates a shorter life expectancy.\nFemales outnumber males at older ages (65-69\nyears) reflecting a higher life expectancy of\nfemales. Women represent 51 per cent of the\ncountry’s population.35\n\nThe majority of the Kenyan population (about\n67.7 per cent) resides in rural areas. However\nthis situation is changing with an increase in\nrural-urban migration.36 The 2009 census\nshowed that the urban population increased\nfrom 5.4 million in 1999 to 12.2 million in 2009.\nClose to half of all Kenyans are projected to be\nurban residents by 205037. Kenya’s urban\npopulation is growing at four per cent per\nannum.38 The increase in urban population and\nlimited affordable housing has resulted in\ninformal settlements with limited housing,\nsanitation, water, energy and waste disposal.\nThe growth of urban population, and the\naccompanying urban poverty (in Kenya about\n55 percent of urban residents currently live in\npoverty in informal settlements) presents a\nmajor development challenge. Residents in\ninformal settlements are highly vulnerable to\nclimate change impacts such as flooding, fires,\nand landslides and often lack basic amenities\n\n 23\n\nand proper sanitation. Better urban planning\nand reforms could help Kenya make the most of\nthe socioeconomic benefits of urbanisation and\nreduce reliance on natural resources such as\nagricultural land.\n\nAbout 46 per cent of the population is under\nthe national poverty line.39,40 Table 3 shows the\nprevalence of poverty in rural areas (49.1 per\ncent) compared to urban areas (33.7 per cent).\nThere are wide variations across counties.\nCounties in the ASALs such as Kitui, Marsabit,\nMandera, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana and\nWest Pokot have poverty levels above 70 per\ncent. These counties are very dry but and\ncharacterised by relatively weak infrastructure\nand poor access to public services.\n\nTable 3: Poverty and inequality in Kenya (per cent), 1993-2006\n\n1992\n1994\n1997\n2000\n2006\nUrban\n\n29.3\n29.0\n49.2\n51.5\n33.7\nRural\n\n 46.0\n46.8\n52.9\n59.6\n49.1\nTotal (urban\nand rural)\n\n41.841\n40.0\n52.3\n56.8\n45.9\nInequality*\n(per cent)\n\n56.9\n44.3\n41.9\n-\n45.2\n\n*Based on Gini coefficient representation of Kenya’s population income distribution\nSource: Modified from UNEP. (2014). Green Economy Assessment Report – Kenya\n\nDespite government efforts to reverse the\npoverty situation, Kenyans below the poverty\nline continue to lack critical services such as\naccess to quality healthcare services, water\nsupply and education. Economic gains have\nlargely\nbenefited\nthe\nwealthiest\nquintile\ncontributing to the country’s social and\neconomic gap (inequality) with great disparities\nbetween the rural and urban areas.\n\nThe poverty and inequality situation expose\nKenyans to climate risk hazards rendering them\nvulnerable to climate change. According to the\nIPCC Working Group II (WGII) 5th Assessment\nReport (AR5) poverty and inequality are the\nmost salient conditions that shape climate-\nrelated vulnerability. Poverty affects livelihood\noptions and creates conditions where people\nhave few assets to buffer extreme events.\nClimate change is an additional burden to the\npoor.\n\nNATURAL RESOURCES PROFILE\n\nBiodiversity\n\nKenya is endowed with a rich biodiversity due\nto the abundance of species within the\ncountry’s varied ecosystems. It is home to five\nglobally important biodiversity hot spots and\nincludes 62 Important Bird Areas (IBAs)42 among\nothers.\nThe\nInternational\nUnion\nfor\nConservation of Nature (IUCN) ranks Kenya\nsecond in Africa in terms of mammalian species\ndiversity.43 Kenya is famous for its diverse group\nof large mammals like the leopard, buffalo,\nblack rhinoceros, African elephant, and African\nlion (also known as the big five). Wildlife based\ntourism contributes about 70 per cent of the\ngross tourism earnings, demonstrating the\nimportance of biodiversity to the economy.44\nThe country’s existing protected area (PA)\nsystem takes care of most of its biodiversity, but\nstill fall short. Kenya’s State of Environment\n\n 24\n\nreport 2010 identifies threats to the country’s\nbiodiversity in the PAs and beyond: humanwildlife conflict; poaching; overexploitation and\nhuman encroachment (human settlements and\nexpansion of their livelihood activities of\nagricultural and livestock development) due\npopulation increase.\n\nNotwithstanding the human-wildlife conflicts,\nclimate\nchange\nhas\na\ndirect\nlink\nwith\nbiodiversity\nand\nspecies\ndiversity\nloss.\nBiodiversity is habitat specific; whenever there\nare changes in climate particular species\ndisappear from their current habitats and new\nspecies appear leading to ecosystem changes.\nObserved changes in Kenya include the drying\nup of rivers and migration of species to new\nhabitats.45\nKenya\nWildlife\nService\n(KWS)\nresearchers confirmed that climate change and\necological disturbances caused an observed\nincrease of infectious diseases leading to deaths\nin wildlife populations. Birds and mammals\nhave been the worst affected, with climate\nchange blamed for the sudden mass death of\nflamingos around Lake Nakuru in the Rift Valley\nin 2006. Hence climate change poses serious\nthreats to biodiversity in Kenya both in aquatic\nand\nterrestrial\necosystems.\nThe\ntourism\nindustry is heavily dependent on biodiversity\nconditions and quality, and climate change is\nexpected to have profound impacts on\nbiodiversity.\n\nForestry\nForests are of high value in Kenya, having\ncritical ecological, social, cultural, and economic\nfunctions. Over 75 per cent46 of Kenya's\nrenewable surface water originates from the\ncountry’s water towers and catchments. The\ncritical water role of forests is important for the\npopulation’s livelihoods, irrigated agriculture,\nand production of hydro-electric power. Forests\ncontribute directly and indirectly to national\nand\nlocal\neconomies\nthrough\nrevenue\ngeneration and wealth creation. Forestry\ncontributes an estimated 3.6 per cent of\nKenya's GDP, excluding charcoal and direct\nsubsistence uses.47\n\nForest classification in the country is based on\ndefinitions set out by the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization (FAO). Forest is defined as a group\nof trees featuring a tree canopy cover of over\n10 per cent, with crowns that are largely\ncontiguous. There are five distinct classes:48\nindigenous closed canopy forests, indigenous\nmangroves, open woodlands, public plantation\nforests and private plantation forests.\n\n 25\n\nFigure 10: Forest classes’ area trend, Kenya, 1990 – 2010\n\nSource: Global Forest Resource Assessment Country Report FAO, page 9 cited in the NCCAP\nMitigation Chapter forestry analysis\n\nFigure 10 shows the area of each of the\nforestland classes in total land area from 1990\nto 2010. Forestry cover comprises mainly open\nwoodlands, encompassing approximately 59 per\ncent of the country’s forest area. Indigenous\nclosed canopy is the second largest class at\napproximately 33 per cent, with public and\nprivate plantations and mangroves making up\nthe remaining share.\n\nFigure 11: Forest area trend, Kenya, 1990-2010\n\nSource: Global Forest Resource Assessment Country Report\n\n 26\n\nKenya has experienced a decline in forest cover\n(Figure 11). At independence in 1963, Kenya’s\nforest cover stood at about 11 per cent.49\nApproximately 12,000 hectares of forest a year\nhave\nbeen\nlost\nthrough\ndeforestation.50\nBetween 1990 and 2010, for instance, forest\ncover fell from 12 per cent in 1990 to 6 per cent\nin 2010.51 The drivers of deforestation are\nmainly unsustainable utilisation and conversion\nof forest land to other land uses.52 About 80 per\ncent of Kenyans rely on wood biomass53 for\ntheir energy requirements and forests also\nprovide other goods to support their livelihoods\nsuch as timber materials. The livelihood needs\nexerts\nconsiderable\npressure\non\nforest\nresources. In addition, the technologies used for\nwood conversion for timber manufacturing and\ncharcoal production are obsolete and wasteful\nleading to overharvesting of trees to meet the\ndemand. As a result deforestation in Kenya has\nbeen high, with a yearly loss to the economy of\nover USD 19 million.54\n\nThe situation is reversing with forestry cover\nestimated as 6.99 per cent as noted in the\ncountry’s National Forest Policy, 2014. The\nincrease is an improvement from 6 per cent in\n2010 and represents good progress toward the\nConstitution’s target of 10 per cent forest cover.\n\nClimate changes is expected to further increase\nforest\ndegradation\npossibly\nresulting\nin\ndesertification.55 This will have adverse impacts\non the economic benefits and livelihoods\nderived from this sector, as well as biodiversity\nand other environmental services. GoK is\nworking to address these challenges, including\nthe development of a national strategy for\nReducing Emissions from Deforestation and\nForest Degradation and fostering conservation,\nsustainable\nmanagement\nof\nforests,\nand\nenhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+).\nThe strategy seeks to incentivise activities to\nhelp meet the tree cover goal of the\nConstitution and Vision 2030. The country has\n\ngained experience in REDD+ through the\nKasigau Wildlife Corridor Project, the first\nactivity in Africa to issue voluntary forestry\ncarbon credits. Other REDD+ projects are under\ndevelopment, including the Mikoko Pamoja\nmangrove restoration project in Kwale and a\nsecond phase of the Kasigau Corridor project.\nThe National Forest Policy 2014 and the Forests\nAct 2005 are the main policy and legislative\ninstruments in this sector, and encourage\nprogress toward the 10 per cent forest cover\nthrough industrial plantations, agroforestry,\nurban forestry and activities implemented by\nlocal forest authorities.\n\nWater Resources\nThe water sector in Kenya underpins its main\neconomic sectors of agriculture, livestock,\ntourism,\nmanufacturing\nand\nenergy.\nThe\ncountry is divided into six major drainage basins\n(Figure 12) consisting of: Lake Victoria North\n(18,374 km2); Lake Victoria South (31,734 km2);\nRift Valley (130,452 km2); Athi (58,639 km2);\nTana (126,026 km2); and Ewaso Ng’iro North\n(210,226 km2).56\n\nIts drainage system is dense with many\nephemeral streams and perennial rivers of\nwhich a small number are permanent. The\npermanent rivers are; Tana, Athi, Sondu, Yala,\nMara, Nzoia and Nyando. Several of these are\ndamned upstream to provide hydroelectricity,\nirrigation and water for domestic use. The main\nrivers drain radially from the central highlands\ninto the rift valley, eastward into Indian Ocean\nand westward into Lake Victoria. Those north of\nMount Elgon and from the highlands along\nSouth Sudan-Ethiopia border drain mainly into\nLake Turkana. The country’s five water towers -\nMount Kenya, Aberdares Ranges, Mau Complex,\nMount Elgon and Cherangany hills - are the\nsource of these rivers. These valuable towers\nare under continuous threat from human\nencroachment which has contributed to the\ndrying up of some of the rivers and streams.57\n\n 27\n\nIn 1992, Kenya was categorised as a water\nscarce country with per capita available water\nresources of 647 m3 per person, below the\ninternationally acceptable threshold of 1000 m3.\nThis was reduced to 586 m3 in 2010 (Table 4)\nlimited availability is further aggravated by\nrapid\npopulation\nincrease\nand\nclimate\nvariability. The scarcity has serious implications\nfor the key sectors of tourism, agriculture and\nindustry, as well as Vision 2030’s flagship\nprojects which rely heavily on water availability.\n\n Figure 12: Kenya water catchment areas\n\n Source: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\nTable 4: Renewable and available water resources\nItem\n2010\n2030\n2050\nPrecipitation (P) *(BCM/y)\n400.1\n441.6\n479.1\nEvapotranspiration € **(BCM/y)\n358.0\n397.3\n425.9\nRenewable WR (P-E) (BCM/y)\n42.1\n44.3\n46.0\nRenewable SW (BCM/y)\n20.6\n24.9\n26.7\nGW Recharge (BCM/y)\n21.5\n19.4\n19.3\nSustainable Yield of GW*** (BCM/y)\n1.9\n1.7\n1.7\nAvailable Water Resources (BCM/y)\n22.5\n26.6\n28.4\nPopulation Projected (million)\n38.5\n67.8\n96.9\nper Capita RWR (m3/y/capita)\n1,093\n653\n475\nper Capita Available WR (m3/y/capita)\n586\n393\n293\nSource: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\nNote: * Multi-model ensemble analysis of 11 GCMs for 2030 and 2050\n** Estimation by FAO Penman-Monteith method\n*** 10% of GW recharge excluding river and riparian areas\n\n 28\n\nFigure 13 gives the distribution of renewable\nsurface water resources while Figure 14\nillustrates the available surface and ground\nwater yields.

The ITCZ brings wet weather\nto the region resulting to Kenya’s two distinct\nwet periods: The ‘long rains’ (March to May)\nand the ‘short rains’ (October to December).\nThe ‘long rains’ bring approximately 70 per cent\nof Kenya’s total rainfall with the ‘short rains’\ncontributing a further 20 per cent.58 The\nremaining six months of the year are typically\ndry, contributing just 10 per cent of the\ncountry’s total rainfall.59\n\nThe Tana and Lake Victoria basins are those\nwith the most renewable surface water\nresources. Athi has the least renewable water\nsources and is the catchment serving the two\nmain cities: Nairobi and Mombasa. The uneven\ndistribution across the basins is a big challenge\nfor water resource management.\n\n 29\n\nFigure 14: National Water Master Plan 2030 available surface and groundwater water yields\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\n3.0\n4.0\n5.0\n6.0\n7.0\n8.0\nLVN\n(0.276)\nLVS\n(0.187)\nRV\n(0.024)\nAthi\n(0.028)\nTana\n(0.062)\nENN\n(0.014)\nRWR (BCM/y)\nSurface Water\n24.9 BCM/y\nGroundwater\n(Sustainable Yield)\n1.7 BCM/y\n\nSource: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\n\nKenya’s water scarcity is expected to be more\nsevere in the future due to an overwhelming\nincrease\nof\nwater\ndemands\nagainst\na\nsubstantially reduced per capita availability of\n393 m3 by 2030 (see Table 5). Figure 15 shows\nthat water demand in 2010 was driven by\nirrigation (50 per cent), domestic use (37 per\ncent) and livestock (8 per cent). Industrial, and\ninland fisheries demand also contributed to the\nrise in water use, although to a lesser degree.\nThe demand from irrigation will increase further\nas Vision 2030 seeks to expand irrigable land by\n1.2 million ha.60 The demand will be greatest in\nthe Tana and Ewaso Ng’iro catchments that\nserve the ASALs region.\n\nFigure 15: Kenya’s water demand 2010\n\nSource: JICA Team - National Water Master Plan 2030\n\n 30\n\nIncreased demand from domestic, livestock and\nindustrial activities is also expected due to the\npopulation growth, as well as implementation\nof Vision 2030 flagship projects.\n\nClimate change is likely to cause changes in\nwater availability in terms of quantity and\nquality, and increasing frequency of floods and\ndroughts is expected to impact the state of the\navailable freshwater resources. Competition for\nthe resource is expected to increase, resulting\nin water resource conflicts between upstream\nand\ndownstream\nusers\nand\nbetween\nagriculturalists and pastoralists.\n\nThe governance framework in the water sector\nis based on the National Water Policy Sessional\nPaper No. 1 of 1999, which was operationalised\nby the enactment of the Water Act in 2002. The\nreforms have aimed at improving service\ndelivery, increasing community participation,\nincreasing\ninvestments\nand\nimplementing\nIntegrated\nWater\nResources\nManagement\n(IWRM). IWRM has intensified activities on\nforestry, soil conservation, and improved land\nuse and water catchment management. To\nproperly develop and manage resources in the\ncountry, the GoK formulated the National\nWater Master Plan in 1992 (NWMP) and\nupdated National Water Master Plan 2030\n(NWMP 2030). The NWMP 2030 factors in new\ncircumstances particularly increasing water\ndemand, impacts of climate change, population\ngrowth,\nand\nalso\nsocial\nand\neconomic\ndevelopments.\n\n ___________________________________\n\nECONOMY, INDUSTRY AND SERVICES PROFILE\n\nEconomy\nKenya is a lower middle-income country with an\nestimated national GDP of US$ 60.9 billion in\n2014.61 Figure 16 gives a visualisation of\nKenya’s\nGDP\ntrend\nfrom\n2000-2013,\ndemonstrating\nthat\nKenya’s\neconomic\nperformance has varied.\n\nFigure 16: National GDP growth rates\n\nSource: Derived from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics data (Data for\n2001 and 2002 not available from source)\n\n 31\n\nGDP growth rates peaked in 2007 at 7.1 per\ncent per annum. Post-election violence in early\n2008 compounded with drought, high global\nenergy and food prices together with the\neffects of the global financial crisis on\nremittance and exports, reduced GDP growth to\n1.5 per cent in 2008.62 The economy rebounded\nin 2010 with GDP growth rates at about six per\ncent, with a slight decline in 2011 and 2012.\n\nFigure 17: Sector contribution to Kenya’s GDP\n\n Source: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\nFigure\n17\nshows\nthe\ndifferent\nsectors’\ncontributions\nto\nGDP\nin\nthe\ncountry.\nApproximately 42 per cent of Kenya’s national\nGDP is derived from its natural resource sectors\n(namely agriculture, forestry, fishing, tourism,\nwater supply and energy). The services sector,\n(which includes transport and communication,\nwholesale and retail trade, financial and other\nservices) accounts for about half of GDP. The\nindustry sector (manufacturing, construction,\nmining\nand\nquarrying)\ncontributes\nthe\nremaining 10 per cent.63\n\nThe informal sub-sector (also known as ‘Jua\nKali’) accounts for about 80 per cent of total\nrecorded employment.64 The sector covers all\nunregulated\nsmall-scale\nactivities\nlargely\nundertaken\nby\nthose\nself-employed.\nAn\nestimated 10 million people were engaged in\nthe informal sector in 2012, up from 6 million\nand 9 million in 2004 and 2010, respectively.65\nThe\ninformal\nsub-sector\nis\ngenerally\ncharacterised by low productivity, vulnerability\nof employment, and low incomes.66\n\nIn addition to concerns about an expanding\ninformal economy, the labour market is also\nbeset with under-employment. In 2013, Kenya’s\nunemployment was estimated at 36 per cent,\nwith those for youth (15-35 years) constituting\nthe highest, at 61 per cent. The rate of\nunemployment varies across the country, with\nthe highest in the north-eastern regions at\nabout 23 per cent (2012) and the lowest in\nNyanza and the western regions, estimated at\n4.8 per cent and 5.2 per cent (2012),\nrespectively.67\n\n 32\n\nIndustry\nThe\nindustrial\nsector\ncomprises\nthe\nmanufacturing,\nconstruction,\nmining\nand\nquarrying sub-sectors. The contribution of the\nsector to GDP in 2013 was 4.8 per cent for\n\nmanufacturing accelerating from 3.2 per cent in\n2012; 5.5 per cent for construction compared to\n4.8 per cent in 2012; and 7.4 per cent for\nmining and quarrying an increase from 4.1 per\ncent in 2012.68\n\n Figure 18: Industry sector growth rate, Kenya 2004-2012\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\nFigure 18 shows a negative trend line in the\nindustry growth rate between 2004 and 2013.\nThe National Industrialisation Policy Framework\n(2011-2015) attributes this to high capital\ninvestment; intermediate and capital goods\nindustries that are relatively underdeveloped,\nhigh energy costs, and environmental concerns.\nThe sector has experienced a weak enabling\npolicy environment because past industrial\npolicies have been contained in many disparate\npolicy documents that have lacked harmonised\nand clearly defined national industrialisation\npolicy. The sector is also characterised by low\nvalue addition, low employment and low\ncapacity\nutilisation.\nA\nnew\nNational\nIndustrialization Policy (2014) is expected to\nprovide\na\nstronger\nand\nmore\nrobust\ninstitutional\nframework\nwithin\nwhich\nto\nsynchronise and coordinate the various policies,\nstrategies and activities. Expansion of the\nindustrial sector forms a significant part of\nKenya’s economic development strategy. The\nstrategies to achieve this include but are not\nlimited to:69\n\nx Promoting investment and expansion in key\nclimate sensitive agro-processing industries;\nx Becoming a provider of basic manufactured\ngoods\nfor\neastern\nand\ncentral\nAfrica\nconsequently expanding the country’s export\nbase;\nx Supporting local industries that use local raw\nmaterials, and adding value to imports that\ncan then be re-exported.\nClimate change will need to be managed to\nachieve these goals. Historically, the sector has\nbeen adversely affected by extreme weather\nevents such as rains and ensuing floods, which\nhave impacted infrastructure such as roads,\nrailways, buildings and ports. These impacts\nindirectly affect industrial production.70 Low\nrainfall has resulted in low water quantities\nleading to interruptions in electricity supply\n\n 33\n\ngiven that most electricity is hydro-generated.\nIn addition, the cost of electricity rises in times\nof drought as diesel generators are used to\nmake up the shortfall. The availability of\nagricultural raw materials needed by industries\nis also adversely affected by recurring drought.\n\nMining, Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extraction\n\nThe country has economically viable quantities\nof coal, iron ore, fluorspar, titanium gypsum,\nlimestone, soapstone, gemstones, soda ash,\ndiatomite, lead, gold, silicon oxide and marble.\nRecent discoveries of oil, gas and rare earth\nminerals suggest that these will be potentially\nimportant resources for Kenya going forward.\nThe mining and quarrying sector registered a\ngrowth of 7.4 per cent in 2013, a substantial\nincrease from 4.1 per cent in 2012.71 The sector\naccounted for only one per cent of GDP and\nthree per cent of total export earnings in\n2014.72 There has been very little exploitation of\nthese resources, and development of the\nmining and quarrying sector is expected to\nsupport resource based industries such as iron\nand steel, cement, building and construction,\nchemical and ornamental industries, among\nothers. The Oil and other mineral resources\nsub-sector has been identified as an additional\npriority sector under the Economic Pillar of\nVision 2030. Developments and decisions could\nimpact on Kenya’s GHG emission profile, with\nuse of domestic coal expected to increase\nemissions in the electricity supply sector.\nVulnerability to climate change in the subsector depends on the mining method. Surface\nmining might be particularly affected by high\nrainstorms and floods.73\n\nManufacturing\n\nMedium and large industries constitute less\nthan five per cent of the total number of\nenterprises but contribute over 60 per cent of\nthe manufacturing sector’s GDP contribution.\nMicro and small enterprises comprise about 95\nper cent of total enterprises (the informal\nsector) but contribute only about 20 per cent to\nthe manufacturing sector’s GDP contribution.\nFormal employment with medium and large\nindustries grew by five per cent in 2012 while\ninformal employment (discussed above) grew\nby 17 per cent in the same period.74 The subsector GDP growth rate was 4.8 per cent in\n2013, an increase from 3.2 per cent in 2012.\nThe sub-sector is highly import dependent, and\nfaces high energy costs and environmental\nconcerns. The unreliable supply of electricity\nmeans that most manufacturers operate\nstandby or diesel emergency power systems.\nOthers such as cement manufacturers are\nexploring coal as an alternative electricity\nsupply source, which could lead to a rise in GHG\nemissions. The First and Second MTPs both give\nattention to growth and diversification in the\nmanufacturing sub-sectors with the aim of\nincreasing the sector’s contribution to GDP and\nforeign exchange earnings. To achieve this,\nthree\nspecial\neconomic\nzones\ntargeting\nmanufacturing were established in Mombasa,\nKisumu and Lamu. Other planned initiatives\ninclude building clusters for meat and leather\nproducts; a stronger dairy sector; and the\ndevelopment of industrial and SME parks in the\n47 counties that will provide linkages to other\nsectors like agricultural and services. Climate\nchange may affect the sub-sector in a number\nof ways. First, climate change affects primary\nsectors such as Agriculture and in turn prices\nand quality and quantity of manufacturing\ninputs. Second, the supply chain particularly\nlogistics is affected leading to delays and in turn\nincrease in cost of services.\n\nServices\n\nTrade\nThe trade sector is a key driver for the\nachievement of national development goal.\nTrade provides linkages with other sectors by\ncreating markets through which goods and\nservices reach the consumer. The trade sector\nin Kenya operates on two levels: domestic and\ninternational.\n\n 34\n\nDomestic trade encompasses mainly wholesale\nand retail trade, contributing an average 10.1\nper cent to GDP. It accounts for about 16 per\ncent and 60 per cent of recorded formal and\ninformal employment, respectively. Kenya has\nrecorded a rapid growth in wholesale retail and\ndistribution, particularly in the supermarkets\nand hypermarkets which realised a growth of 32\nper cent between 2000 and 2010,75 with some\nof these expanding to regional markets. The\nexponential growth of supermarkets has been\ndriven\nby\nchanging\nconsumer\nlifestyles,\nincreased urbanisation, and economic growth.76\n\nInternational Trade: Kenya’s external trade is\nhighly skewed towards agricultural commodity\nexports. The value of total merchandise exports\nwas 45 per cent in 2013 while imports were\n81.1 per cent in the same year.77 A high\npercentage of imports over exports has led to a\nwidening of the country’s trade balance. Most\nof the imports are capital goods or raw\nmaterials (e.g. petroleum products, motor\nvehicles, electric equipment, food, metals and\nplastics) for industrial production. The exports\nconsist\nmostly\nof\nagricultural\nproducts\nparticularly\ntea,\ncoffee\nand\nhorticultural\nproduce. The East African Community, the\ncountry’s largest market, accounts for about 27\nper cent of Kenya’s total exports, followed by\nAsia and Europe.78 The country also exports\nclothing and apparel to the United States\nthrough the African Growth and Opportunity\nAct (AGOA). The export base has remained\nlargely the same since Independence; inferring\nthat the country has been unsuccessful in\ndiversifying the export base. To reduce the\ntrade balance and diversify its export base the\nGoK is actively seeking to enlarge export market\nby integrating external trade as part of foreign\npolicy.\n\nThe trade sector depends on services and\nproducts offered by other sectors such as\nenergy, agriculture and transport. The sector is\nvulnerable to climate change, subject to\nchanges in rainfall reliability and extreme\nweather events such as drought, floods. Climate\nchange impacts affect yields, production costs,\nprices, and, in macroeconomic terms, Kenya’s\ntrade balance. Climate change also affects the\nvalue\nchain\nparticularly\nwarehouse\nand\ntransport facilities (road, rail, sea). Transport\ninfrastructure suffered substantial damage in\nthe 1997 -1998 El-Niño rains which caused\neconomic losses of US$ one billion mainly from\nreduced trade activities.79\n\nTourism\nKenya has a wide diversity of natural assets,\nincluding over 500 km of year-round warm\nsandy coastal beaches, marine ecosystems,\nabundant wildlife, a rich and diverse cultural\nheritage, and Mount Kenya’s glaciers. The\ntourism sector contributes approximately 10\nper cent to overall GDP, making it the third\nmost important sector after agriculture and\nmanufacturing and Kenya’s third largest foreign\nexchange earner after tea and horticulture.80\n\n 35\n\nFigure 19: Tourism numbers\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\nFigure\n19\nshows\ntourist\narrivals\nwere\napproximately 1.5 million in 2013 a decrease\nfrom 1.7 million in 2012. The earnings declined\nfrom KSh. 96 billion in 2012 to KSh. 94 billion in\n2013 (Figure 20). The slowdown in tourist\narrivals in 2013 is attributed to the global\neconomic slowdown, especially in Europe, and\nnegative publicity related to security in the\ncountry. Vision 2030 seeks to position Kenya\namong the top 10 long-haul tourist destinations\nin the world by providing a high-end, unique\nand varied experience for visitors. Internal\ninsecurity and climate change impacts could\npose challenges to achieving this goal.\n\nFigure 20: Tourism earnings\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\n 36\n\nClimate change impacts tourism, which relies on\na natural resource base. The NCCAP showed\nthat climate change may already be affecting a\nwide range of the environmental resources that\nare critical attractions for tourism, such as\nwildlife productivity and biodiversity, and water\nlevels and quality. Noted observed impacts\ninclude a reduction in the volume of the Mara\nRiver (due to climatic variations and the\ndestruction of the Mau catchment) which has\ntaken a toll on migration of wildebeests\nbetween the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania)\nand the Maasai Mara Reserve (Kenya). In\naddition, flash floods have at times rendered\nsome tourist destinations (e.g. Maasai Mara in\n2011) inaccessible due to the destruction of the\nroad infrastructure. Other impacts include\nwildlife human conflicts especially in Northern\nKenya where longer and more frequent\ndroughts have ravaged pastoralist populations\nin recent decades, increasing the pressure on\nthe limited resources available, which have to\nbe shared with wildlife.81 Increases in deaths in\nwildlife populations from infectious diseases.\nAre impacted by climate change Birds and\nmammals have been the worst affected, with\nclimate change blamed for the sudden mass\ndeath of flamingos around Lake Nakuru in the\nRift Valley in 2006. 82\n\nInformation Communications and Technology\n(ICT)\nInformation and Communication Technology\n(ICT) has been identified as a key enabler to the\nattainment of the goals and aspirations of the\nVision 2030, helping to transform Kenya into a\nknowledge and information based economy by\nenabling access to quality, affordable and\nreliable ICT services in the country. The\nGovernment has undertaken various measures\naimed at developing the ICT sector, such as\nputting in place a national broadband strategy.\n\nThe growth in ICT-enabled services has opened\na new window for Kenya. The Vision 2030\nidentified Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) –\nIT enabled - as a priority sector. By 2012 Kenya\n\nhad witnessed growth of key BPO companies\nsuch as KenCall, Safaricom, Kentech and\nHorizon.83 Growth has also been witnessed in\nother related industries such as computer\nhardware manufacturing and the acquisition\nand use of computers, mobile phones and\ntelevision sets. ICT growth has led to computers\nand the internet being common across\nbusinesses in all sectors, with mobile phones in\nparticular becoming an essential part of Kenya’s\npopulation daily lives.\n\nICT has been one of the main drivers of Kenya’s\neconomic growth over the last decade. Since\n2000, ICT has been responsible for 0.9 of the 3.7\nper cent annual GDP growth, and for all of\nKenya’s GDP per capita growth (World Bank).\nThe ICT sub-sector is expected to contribute\nover 10 per cent to GDP by 2017. To achieve\nthis goal, the GoK is implementing various\ninitiatives that include improving universal\naccess to IT, promotion of BPOs, capacity\nbuilding, development of digital content, roll\nout of e-government services, establishment of\nan information technology (IT) knowledge\nbased\ncentre\n(Konza\nTechno\nCity)\nand\npromotion of ICT-based industries.\n\nFrom a climate change perspective ICT has an\nimportant role to play in the development of\ncapacity for adaptation and mitigation.84 For\nadaptation ICT can facilitate the processes of\nknowledge\nintegration\nand\nlearning.\nAn\nexample is the Kilimo Salama partnership\nbetween Syngenta Foundation, UAP Insurance\nand Safaricom that offers insurance policies to\nfarmers who plant on as little as one acre of\nland to shield them from significant financial\nlosses when drought or excess rain negatively\nimpact their harvests. Payments to farmers are\nmade through a mobile enabled platform\n(known as MPesa). ICTs could play an important\nmitigation role through “smart” applications\nsuch as smart metering to promote energy\nefficiency. Additionally ICT growth is expected\nto lead to increased electricity demand and\ndisposal challenges will result from a high rate\n\n 37\n\nof obsolete ICT equipment due to technological\nchange.\n\nTransport\nKenya’s rapidly growing\ntransport sector\naccounts for about 10 per cent of GDP.85 Vision\n2030 identifies transport is a key enabler of\nsustainable growth. Reliable and efficient road,\nrail, air and water transport infrastructure\nfacilitates smooth and faster movement of\ngoods and services and national and regional\nintegration. This, boosts trade within and across\nKenyan\nborders,\npromotes\neconomic\ndevelopment, and contributes to poverty\nreduction and wealth creation. .\n\nThe sector has seen significant enhancements\nto improve the movement of people and goods,\nincluding the building of the Nairobi-Thika\nsuperhighway;\nthe\nmodernising\nof\nthe\nMombasa-Nairobi highway; expanding the\ninternational airport in Nairobi, upgrading of\nthe port of Mombasa; developing a port in\nLamu; and upgrading the railway track between\nMombasa and Nairobi.\n\nThe road transport, subsector has experienced\nsignificant growth, with the vehicle population\n(excluding motorcycles) having increased from\n600,000 in 2000 to 2.2 million in 2013. The high\ngrowth of registered vehicles in Nairobi,\ncoupled with underdeveloped infrastructure\nhas led to severe traffic congestion, especially\nduring the extended peak hours, contributing to\nlocal air pollution and resultant health impacts\nand significant economic losses as much time\nand fuel is spent in the traffic congestion. To\nreduce traffic congestion in Nairobi, the\ngovernment has developed plans to introduce a\nMass Rapid Transport (MRTS) system that\nincludes both a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system\ncomplemented by commuter rail,\n\nAn estimated 47 per cent of Nairobi residents\nand the majority of rural residents rely on\ntransport by foot. Public transport services are\ncomparably expensive or\nin\nsome case\ninadequate to meet demand, and private cars\nare out of the financial reach of the majority of\ncitizens.86 Public transport is relatively under-\n\ndeveloped and is dominated by minibuses\n(matatus). The government has identified the\nmobility needs of Kenya’s rural inhabitants and\nhas stated its commitment to the promotion of\nIntermediate Means of Transport (IMTs) as a\nstrategy for poverty alleviation.\n\nThe vast majority of freight transport, including\ntransit freight headed to other countries, is\nserved by trucks. About 30 per cent of the cargo\nhandled at the port of Mombasa is transit cargo\ndestined for such countries as Uganda, Rwanda\nand Burundi. Railway transport of freight is\nexpected to increase with the construction of a\nstandard gauge railway line linking Mombassa\nto Malaba in Uganda; and development of a\nnew transport corridor linking Lamu Port with\nSouth Sudan and Ethiopia. Most petroleum\nproducts are transported from Mombasa to the\nhinterland via a pipeline.\n\nInternational and domestic air transport has\nbeen growing and plays a key role in supporting\nsome of Kenya’s leading foreign exchange\nearners, namely tourism and horticulture.\nThe transport sector is a significant and growing\ncontributor of greenhouse gas emissions. The\nNCCAP reported that emissions from the sector\nare expected to triple between 2010 and 2030,\nfrom a baseline of six million tonnes of CO2equivalent in 2010. The road-subsector is the\nmain source of emissions, responsible for about\n99 per cent of emissions from non-aviation\ntransport.87 Rail systems improvements and\ndevelopment of an MRT in Nairobi are\nmitigation actions that will improve road safety\nand facilitate regional trade.\nThe transport sector is also impacted by climate\nchange, including heavy rains and sea level rise.\nDue to the importance of transport in the\ndevelopment of Kenya and the region, and as\nrecommended in the NCCAP, Kenya will aim to\nmainstream\nclimate\nchange\ninto\nthe\ndevelopment of port facilities, roads, railways\n\n 38\n\nand bridges to account for rising sea levels,\nflooding and the increased occurrence of\nextreme weather events. Addressing climate\nchange in the in the transport sector means\nworking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\nwhile encouraging development of transport\ninfrastructure that accounts for flooding,\nextreme weather events and other effects of\nclimate change.\n\nAGRICULTURE PROFILE\n\nThe agricultural sector directly contributes\nabout 25.4 per cent of Kenya’s GDP88 and\nanother 27 per cent indirectly via linkages to\nagro-based industries and the service sector,\ngiving an overall 52 per cent contribution to\nKenya’s GDP. The crops (horticulture, food\ncrops and industrial/cash crops), livestock and\nfisheries subsectors are the main components\nof\nthe\nagricultural\nsector,\nrespectively\ncontributing about 78 per cent, 20 per cent and\n2 per cent of agricultural GDP.89 Growth of the\nnational economy is highly correlated to growth\nand\ndevelopment\nin\nagricultural\nsector,\nindicating the sector’s importance for the\nstimulation of overall economic growth (Figure\n21). Agriculture is the primary source of\nlivelihoods for the majority of Kenyans,\naccounting for 18 per cent and 60 per cent of\nthe formal and total employment respectively.\nIt accounts for 65 per cent of Kenya’s total\nexports.90\n\nAreas of high to medium agricultural potential\n(food crop production, cash crops and dairy\nfarming) cover less than 15 per cent of land\narea and supporting about 80 per cent of the\ncountry’s population (NEMA, 2010). Population\nincrease and scarcity of land in the high to\nmedium production areas has led to subdivision\nof land resulting in small uneconomic farms that\ncannot be run sustainably. Farming in the\ncountry is largely small-scale, with 75 to 80 per\ncent of total agricultural production from rainfed farms that average 0.2 to 3 hectares in\nsize.91 The problem is expected to increase with\npopulation growth.\n\nThe crops subsector includes maize, rice,\nwheat, sorghum, potatoes, cassava, vegetables\nand beans. Kenya’s agriculture is 98% rain-fed\nand predominantly small-scale, especially in the\nmedium to high-potential areas. Changes in\nprecipitation either in quantity and/or timing\nhave a great impact on production. Limited\nrainfall also contributes to the production\npressures, which are compounded by high input\ncosts especially fertilizers, poor marketing\nchains, low level of mechanisation and high\ntransport costs.. Production of the main food\ncrops – maize, wheat and rice – has generally\nbeen\nbelow\nthe\ncountry’s\nconsumption\nrequirements\nthus\ncontributing\nto\nfood\ninsecurity.92\n\nThe key cash crops in Kenya are tea, coffee,\nsugar cane, pyrethrum, and tobacco. Tea is one\nof the leading foreign exchange earners in the\ncountry. The horticulture industry is the second\nmost important foreign exchange earner. Its\nproducts include cut flowers, vegetables, fruits,\nnuts, herbs and spices.\n\nThe livestock subsector, including beef, dairy,\nsheep and goats, camel, poultry and pigs, plays\nan important economic and socio-cultural role\nin many Kenyan communities. Dairy cattle are\nmainly kept in the medium to high-rainfall\nareas. Beef is produced on rangelands with\ndairy cattle culls contributing significantly to\nsupply. Kenya ranks second in the East Africa\nregion after Sudan in both animal product yields\nand value.93 Sheep and goats play a key role in\nthe food security and incomes of pastoral\nhouseholds due to their short generation\nintervals, high adaptability and versatile feeding\nhabits. Pig rearing has withstood periodic\nfluctuations\nand\nis\nnow\nrelatively\nwell\nestablished. Camels are reared mainly in the\narid areas, and their high versatility in drought\nperiods means their rearing is gradually\n\n 39\n\nextending to the South Rift region and is\nexpected to expand to other parts of the\ncountry.\n\nProduction in the fisheries subsector is fairly\nminimal\nwith\naquaculture\ncommercial\nenterprises increasingly taking shape.\n\nFigure 21: Agricultural GDP Growth Rate vs. National GDP Growth Rate (% change), 1968-2012\n\nSource: World Bank, 2014\nThe agricultural sector is highly vulnerable to\nclimate change. Growth rates in the agricultural\nsector are correlated with flood and drought\nevents, and historically negative growth indices\nhave been associated with extreme weather\nevents (see Figure 22). A study by the\nAdaptation to Climate Change and Insurance\n(ACCI) project94 reported the occurrence of 41\nflood events and 12 drought events between\n1970 and 2013, noting that flooding tends to be\nmore frequent but more localized, while\ndrought is less frequent but more systemic. The\ncycle of drought is becoming shorter, more\nfrequent and more intense.\n\nAgricultural sector productivity is directly\ninfluenced by emerging and projected changes\nin\nclimatic\npatterns,\nincluding\nincreased\nvariability of seasonal rains. National trends\nindicate an increase in temperature and highly\nvariable rainfall where first season rains are\nlower in amounts and more variable, while\nsecond season rains have increased in amount.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of the extreme\nweather and climate events such as drought\nand floods are also on the increase. These\nweather events result in increased soil erosion,\ndeforestation, loss of soil fertility and reduced\nproductivity. The increasing frequency and\nmagnitude of extreme weather events has\ncontributed to a decline in the annual growth\nrate in agricultural “value added” (Government\nof Kenya, 2014)95.\n\n 40\n\nFigure 22: Agricultural growth index and major extreme events in Kenya 1980 – 2012\n\nSource: World Bank, 2014\n\nENERGY PROFILE\n\nEnergy is a critical component for the Kenyan\neconomy and its population’s standard of living.\nVision 2030 identifies energy as a key\nfoundation and one of the “enablers” upon\nwhich the economic, social and political pillars\nwill be built. The GoK recognises that the\nsuccessful implementation of its flagship\nprojects will greatly depend on supply of\nadequate, reliable, clean and affordable energy.\nAs a result the demand for electricity will\nincrease as the numerous economic activities\nimplemented and new county governments\ntake shape. In particular will be the energy\nintensive activities such as mining; production\nof iron and steel products; irrigation of large\ntracts of land for food security; operation of\npetroleum pipelines for both crude and refined\nfuel oils amongst others. The level and intensity\nof commercial energy use in the country will\ncertainly be a key indicator of the degree of its\neconomic growth and development.\n\nKenya faces serious constraints in energy\nsupply, including low access to modern energy\nservices, high cost of energy, irregular supply\nand high cost of energy investments96. Biomass\n(wood fuel, charcoal, and agricultural waste),\npetroleum and electricity are the main sources\nof energy in the country. They account for 76\nper cent, 21 per cent, and 3 per cent,\nrespectively, of the country’s total energy\nconsumption (Figure 23).\n\nWood fuel is the most important source of\nenergy in the country. About 80 per cent of the\npopulation depends on it for their domestic\nneeds, providing 90 per cent and 85 per cent of\nrural\nand\nurban\nhouseholds’\nenergy\nrequirement, respectively.97 Current wood\nharvesting\nis\nunsustainable\nleading\nto\ndeforestation and land degradation in the\ncountry.98\n\n 41\n\nFigure 23: Kenya Energy Sources\n\nSource: Derived from data based on Ellis K. et al, 2013\n\nPetroleum is imported and mainly used in the\ntransport, commercial and industrial sectors.\nKenya’s import of petroleum accounted for\nabout 16 per cent of the total import bill in\n2012 and 17.9 per cent in 2013 and consumed\nabout 31 per cent and 55 per cent of the\ncountry’s foreign exchange earnings from\nmerchandise exports in 2012 and 2013,\nrespectively.99 Kenya currently relies on imports\nfor all petroleum requirements. However, with\nthe discovery of oil in the country, this trend is\nexpected to change with time.\n\nIn 2013, electricity in Kenya was generated\nmainly from hydropower, geothermal and\nthermal sources. Figure 25 and Figure 26 show\nthe electricity generation by sources in 2013.\nThe\ntotal\ninstalled\nelectricity\ngeneration\ncapacity in Kenya was 7,890 GWh.\n\nFigure 24 shows the electricity generation by\nsources for the period 2004 to 2013.\nHydropower, the main source of electricity,\nreduced considerably in 2009 due to reduced\nrainfall and reduced hydrology in the main\ncatchment areas of the major rivers on which\ngenerating dams are constructed. This was\naggravated by the destruction of water\ncatchment areas leading to dry water levels and\nsiltation in the dams.100 Droughts and declines\nin rainfall have led to lower reservoir levels\nreducing hydropower production.101\n\nGeothermal power is increasingly becoming a\nkey player and may take over from hydropower\nas the leading source of electricity in the\ncountry. Other renewable energy sources such\nas wind, solar and biomass (cogeneration) are\nalso becoming important alternative sources of\nelectricity although these remain insignificant in\nthe country’s overall energy mix. Programmes\nfor their increased development and use have\nbeen formulated such as the revised Feed-inTariff (FiT) policy in 2010.\n\nThe electricity mix is projected to change in\norder to drive the achievement of Vision 2030\nand in light of recent resource discoveries and\nlong-term plans. Kenya’s National Energy Policy\n2014, which has been formulated within the\nframework\nof\nVision\n2030,\nconsiders\ndiversification of electricity sources. Through it,\n\n 42\n\nthe GoK has developed a plan to raise electricity\ngeneration capacity by an additional 5,000 MW\nfrom the current 1,664 MW that will total to\n6,762 MW by 2016. The new capacity will\nmainly be developed from geothermal 1,646\nMW, natural gas 1,050 MW, wind 630 MW and\ncoal 1,920 MW. This new plan will not only\nimprove Kenya’s energy security but also\nreduce\ndependency\non\nhydropower\nand\nimported fuels.\n\nOnly about 25 per cent of the total population\nin Kenya are connected to the grid.102 About 60\nper cent of all the generated electricity is\nconsumed by the commercial and industrial\nsectors and only about 25 per cent is used by\nhouseholds.103\n\nFigure 24: Electricity generation sources for the period 2004 -2013\n\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\nThe key challenges in the electricity sub-sector\nin the country include:\nx Inadequate power generation capacity\nx Major power outages that cost the country up\nto two per cent of GDP and that have led to\nabout 70 per cent of the country’s firms\ninvesting in their own generation compared\nto only 10 per cent of firms in South Africa104\nx High electricity costs\n\nClimate change will exacerbate the situation, as\nprolonged drought leads to a reduction of water\nlevels in dams. The low October to December\n2013 rainfall resulted in reduced water levels in\nthe hydroelectric power generation dams,\nleading to power shortages and electricity\nrationing.105 Flooding has led to siltation of\ndams, and the resultant reduction of water\nstorage\nand\nhydroelectricity\ngeneration\ncapacity.106 The adverse effects of climate\nvariability and change on hydropower are\nprojected to grow.107\n\nHEALTH PROFILE\n\nVision 2030 emphasizes making progress on\nuniversal access to health care, prevention and\nprimary health care, clean water, management\nof communicable disease, maternal and child\nhealth, and non-communicable diseases. It also\nseeks\nto\ninvest\nin\nmedical\nresearch,\npharmaceutical production and health tourism\nas a means of diversifying external revenue\nsources and serve as a regional hub for health\nservices. The GoK allocates about 4.6 per cent\n\n 43\n\nof the national budget to health, which remains\nbelow the Abuja target of 15 per cent.108\n\nKenya has made progress to improve health\ncare especially in tackling communicable\ndiseases such as HIV-AIDs, tuberculosis and\nmalaria. About 52 per cent of Kenya’s\npopulation has access to basic health services\nwithin 5 km, 109 although significant disparities\nin service availability exist between rural and\nurban areas. The ASALs remain the most\ndisadvantaged in the provision of health\nservices especially, the distribution of health\nfacilities and availability of health personnel.\nMortality rates remain high. The main causes of\nmortality include: HIV/AIDS (29.3 per cent),\nperinatal conditions (9 per cent), lower\nrespiratory\ninfections\n(8.1\nper\ncent),\ntuberculosis (TB) (6.3 per cent), diarrhoea (6.0\nper cent) and malaria at (5.8 per cent).110\n\nClimate change will negatively impact progress\nin the health sector. For example, rising\ntemperatures and erratic rainfall may lead to an\nincreased spread of various diseases, such as\nmalaria because of an increase in mosquito\nbreeding habitats. Historical incidences of\nincreased temperature and rainfall, such as\nduring the El Niño events of 1982 to 1983 and\n1997\nto\n1998,\ncoincided\nwith\nmalaria\noutbreaks111 In addition the reduction of surface\nwater will increase the exploitation of ground\nwater which will lead to more people suffering\nfrom diseases such as fluorosis, diabetes and\nhypertension.112 This is because ground water in\nsome areas such as the Rift Valley have been\nfound to contain specific compounds such as\nhigh fluoride levels, high sodium levels and low\nchromium levels which are directly associated\nwith the increased emergence of these\ndiseases.113\n\nThe environment, water, health and sanitation\nsectors are interconnected. Climate change\nimpacts in the environment and water sectors\nalso affect the health and sanitation sector; and\nactions in these sectors need to be looked at\nholistically in order to avoid mal-adaptation.\n\nEDUCATION PROFILE\n\nKenya has had a remarkable increase in access\nand participation rates in the education sector\nas reflected in indicators of the enrolment rate\nand gender parity across all levels of education.\nHowever, disparities still exist, and access and\nparticipation rates remain below national\naverage in the ASALs. The disparities at county\nlevel are further aggravated by inefficient\nutilisation of available resources, as manifested\nthrough teacher absenteeism and limited\nemphasis on monitoring of actual performance.\n\nPrimary\neducation\nrecorded\nthe\nhighest\nprogress, while access rates at pre-primary,\nsecondary and tertiary education remain below\nthe sub-Saharan average of 7%. Learning\noutcomes at the secondary school are still\nweak, with about 70 per cent of candidates\nfailing to achieve the minimum grade for\nadmission to university. Equally, the literacy\nlevel has remained low.\n\nThe GoK has developed plans to address issues\nrelated to access, equity, quality, relevance,\nservice\ndelivery,\ncurriculum,\nteacher\ndevelopment and management, as well as\ntraining in the areas of technology and\nentrepreneurial skill development.\n\n 44\n\nTable 5: National education indicators\n\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\nPre-Primary GER\n60.6\n60.9\n65.6\n66.3\nPre-Primary NER\n49\n50\n52.4\n53.3\nPrimary GER\n110\n109.8\n115\n115.8\nPrimary NER\n92.9\n91.4\n95.7\n95.3\nSecondary GER\n45.3\n47.8\n48.8\n49.3\nMinistry of Education Budget (% )\n16\n15.6\n13.5\n11.4\nPrimary teacher/ Student ratio (public)\n1:52\n1:54\n1:57\n1:56\nSecondary teacher/ Student ratio (public)\n1:30\n1:31\n1:31\n1:32\nSource: Authors derivations of data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics\n\nINSTITUTIONAL PROFILE\n\nThis section provides information on GoK\ninstitutions, policies, plans, strategies and\ninitiatives that provide a governance framework\nfor implementing climate change responses.114\n\nThe Government of Kenya is developing a policy\nand institutional framework to guide the\ncountry toward a low carbon climate resilient\ndevelopment pathway. Kenya’s governance\nstructure has been informed by the global and\nregional commitments and obligations, such as\nUNFCCC (1992), Africa’s African Climate Change\nStrategy (2011) and East Africa’s Climate\nChange Policy, Strategy and Master Plan (2011).\n\nThe first national policy document on climate\nchange, the National Climate Change Response\nStrategy (NCCRS), has improved understanding\nof the issue and has guided policy decisions\nsince its launch in 2010. To operationalize the\nNCCRS, Kenya prepared the National Climate\nChange Action Plan 2013-2017 (NCCAP). The\naction plan is delivered through eight subcomponents:\nx Long-term National Low Carbon Climate\nResilient Development Pathway\nx Enabling Policy and Regulatory Framework\n\nx Adaptation Analysis and Prioritisation\nx Mitigation\nx Technology\nx National\nPerformance\nand\nBenefit\nMeasurement\nx Knowledge\nManagement\nand\nCapacity\nDevelopment\nx Finance\n\nThe Government of Kenya has moved to\nimplement a number of actions in the NCCAP,\nincluding improved drought management and\npromotion of renewable energy. The Ministry of\nPlanning and Devolution (MOPD) has included\nindicators to track progress in mainstreaming\nclimate change in its Second Handbook of\nNational Reporting. A Climate Change Bill is\nexpected to be enacted into law in 2015. This\nBill includes establishment of a National Climate\nChange Council that has responsibility for\ncoordination\nof\nclimate\nchange\nactions,\nincluding mainstreaming climate change in\nnational and county budgets, plans and\nprograms. A draft Climate Change Framework\nPolicy and a National Policy on Climate Finance\nare\nexpected\nto\nprovide\nguidance\non\nmainstreaming to national departments and\ncountry governments.\n\n 45\n\nNational Policies and Legislation\nOther relevant national policies and legislation\nthat\ncontain\nmeasures\nthat\nenable\nmainstreaming of climate change are included\nin Table 6 below.\n\nTable 6: Key National Policies and Legislation\nPolicies\nMeasures to mainstream climate change\nConstitution of Kenya\n(2010)\nA clean and health environment (Articles 42, 69 and 70) is a fundamental right\nunder the Bill of Rights, providing a rationale for the formulation of adaptation and\nmitigation legislation, policies and strategies. The Constitution establishes the right\nto food security while emphasizing sustainable and productive management of land\nand natural resources, such as a goal of tree cover of 10 per cent of the country’s\nland area.\nKenya Vision 2030\nThe national development blueprint has many plans and programs that factor in\naspects of adaptation and mitigation. Its flagship projects include irrigation\nexpansion, geothermal development and slum rehabilitation.\nNational Policy for the\nSustainable Development of\nNorthern Kenya and other\nArid Lands\nFocuses on climate resilience requiring government to find solutions to address\nclimate challenges and to come up with measures to manage drought and\nstrengthen livelihoods. The establishment of the National Drought Management\nAuthority (NDMA), the National Disaster Contingency Fund and the Council for\nPastoralists education are provided for in the policy.\nNational Disaster\nManagement Policy, 2012\nMainstreams disaster risk reduction in the country’s development initiatives, and\naims to increase and sustain resilience of vulnerable communities to hazards.\nNational Environment Policy\n(2013)\nProvide a framework for an integrated approach to planning and sustainable\nmanagement of Kenya’s environment and natural resources.\nEnvironmental Management\nand Coordination Act (1999)\nProvides the framework for the management of the environment, including the\nestablishment of NEMA which is a regulator in matters of environment, the\nDesignated National Authority (DNA) for the CDM and the National Implementing\nEntity (NIE) for the Adaptation Fund.\nKenya Forestry Master Plan\n(1995-2020)\n\nProvides an overarching framework for forestry development and recognises the\nenvironmental role of forests including water values, biodiversity values, climate\nchange values through carbon sequestration and other environmental services.\nSecond National\nEnvironment Action Plan\n(2009-2013)\nProvides a broad framework for the coordination of environmental activities by the\nprivate sector and Government to guide the course of development activities, with a\nview to integrating environment and development for better management of\nresources.\nNational Water Master Plan\n2030\nAssesses and evaluates the availability and vulnerability of country’s water\nresources up to around 2050 taking climate change into consideration.\nWater Act (2002)\nProvides the overall governance of the sector, and recognises the climate change\nimplications on health, sanitation and water.\nAgricultural Sector\nDevelopment Strategy, 20102020\nProvides the framework for transforming agriculture into a modern and\ncommercially viable sector. Notes that addressing food security will require\naddressing the challenge of over-dependence on rain fed agriculture.\nEnergy Policy and Act (2004)\n\nEncourages implementation of indigenous renewable energy sources to enhance\nthe country’s electricity supply capacity. The policy is implemented through the\nEnergy Act of 2006 (revised 2014), which provides for mitigation of climate change,\nthrough energy efficiency and promotion of renewable energy.\nThe Feed in Tariffs (FiTs)\nPolicy (2008,revised 2012)\nPromotes generation of electricity from renewable sources.

The Ministry is also\nresponsible for making policy on climate change and for the coordination\nof climate change response in the country. The National Climate Change\nSecretariat (NCCS) is a department of the Ministry and spearheads the\ndevelopment and implementation of climate change policies, strategies\nand action plans. These include: National Climate Change Action Plan\n(2013-2017) which implements the National Climate Change Response\nStrategy (2010). The Ministry is the national focal point for the UNFCCC.\nIn addition to the NCCS, the Ministry comprises of the following\ndepartments and institutions, which also play a role in the national\nclimate change response:\n• National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) – This is a\nstate corporation established by the Environmental Management\nand Coordination Act No.8 of 1999 whose mandate is to supervise\nand coordinate all matters related to the environment. With regard\nto climate change, NEMA serves as the Designated National\nAuthority for the Clean Development Mechanism and the National\nImplementing Entity for the Adaptation Fund. NEMA is also the\ntechnical entity that produces the National Communications to the\nUNFCCC\n• Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD)\n• Department of Resource Surveys and Remote Sensing (DRSRS)\nMinistry of Devolution and\nPlanning\nThis Ministry is responsible for national development planning,\nleadership and coordination of devolution; and associated monitoring\nand evaluation in Kenya. It leads the process to mainstream climate\nchange into the national plans including the 5 year mid-term plans under\nVision2030. It also works with the MENR to analyse the risks and impacts\nof climate change to national development.\nThe National Treasury\nThe Ministry is charged with the responsibility of formulating financial\nand economic policies as well as the management of revenues,\nexpenditures and borrowing by the GoK. In relation to climate change,\nthe Ministry is responsible for the allocation of funds from the exchequer\nand is the National Designated Authority to the Green Climate Fund\nMinistry of Energy and\nPetroleum\nThe Ministry is mandated to facilitate provision of clean, sustainable,\naffordable and secure energy for national development while protecting\nthe environment. The Ministry has a department of renewable energy\n\n 47\n\nand other associated relevant institutions which include: Rural\nElectrification Authority (REA), Geothermal Development Company\n(GDC), Kenya Electricity Generation Company (KENGEN), Kenya Power\nand the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO),\nCentre for Energy Efficiency and Conservation (CEEC).\nMinistry of Agriculture,\nLivestock & Fisheries\n\nThe Ministry of Agriculture is mandated to promote and facilitate\nproduction of food, livestock and fisheries and agricultural raw materials\nfor food security and incomes; advance agro-based industries, and\nagricultural exports; and enhance sustainable use of land resources as\nthe basis for agricultural enterprises. Due to the sensitivity of agriculture\nto climate change, the Ministry has established a climate change unit\nthat coordinates climate related issues across the agriculture sector. The\nMinistry is also implementing various climate change programmes and\nprojects.\nNational Council for Science &\nTechnology (NCST)\nThe NCST is an advisory institution on matters of Science,\nTechnology, Innovation and Research in Kenya for national social\neconomic development.\nNational Drought Management\nAuthority (NDMA)\nEstablished by Legal Notice in late 2011, the core mandate of the NMDA\nis to exercise general supervision and coordination over all matters\nrelating to drought management in Kenya, and to be the principal\ninstrument of Government in ensuring the delivery of all the policies and\nstrategies that relate to drought management and climate change\nadaptation.\nClimate Change Units/Desk\nOffices\nClimate Change Units and Desk Offices have been established in most\nGovernment of Kenya institutions including: Kenya Agricultural Research\nInstitute (KARI), Kenya Forest Service (KFS), Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS),\nand Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI).\nCounty Governments\nThe Kenya Constitution 2010 establishes 47 constitutionally autonomous\ncounty governments that have defined spheres of power and functions.\nThe County Governments Act, 2012 states that a county government shall\nplan within a framework that integrates economic, physical, social,\nenvironmental and spatial planning, and protect and develop natural\nresources in a manner that aligns national and county government\npolicies. Climate change is a function of the national and county\ngovernment and requires concurrent jurisdiction across both levels.\nVarious functions assigned to county governments are integral to\nfulfilment of actions required to address climate change.\nSource: Kenya's National Climate Change Action Plan\n\nThe\nNational\nEnvironment\nManagement\nAuthority\n(NEMA),\na\nsemi-autonomous\ngovernment agency in the MENR, is responsible\nfor the overall coordination and management of\nthe process of preparation of Kenya’s national\ncommunications.\nNEMA\nwas\nestablished\nunder\nthe\nEnvironmental Management and Co-ordination\nAct No. 8 of 1999 (EMCA) in 1999. The EMCA\nmandates the Authority to exercise general\nsupervision and coordination over all matters\nrelating to the environment and to be the\nprincipal instrument of the GoK in the\nimplementation of all policies relating to the\nenvironment. NEMA’s work is guided by\nprovisions in Articles 42 and 70 of Kenya’s\nConstitution 2010. Article 42 states that every\nperson has the right to clean and healthy\nenvironment. Article 70 provides the right to\nhave environment protected for the benefit of\npresent\nand\nfuture\ngenerations\nthrough\nlegislative and other measures. In addition\n\n 48\n\nNEMA work links closely with the Vision 2030\ngoal of a clean secure and sustainably managed\nenvironment. NEMA has been assigned leading\nroles in the flagship projects of Waste\nmanagement;\nEducation\nfor\nSustainable\nDevelopment (ESD); securing wildlife corridors\nthrough the EIA process; clean development\nmechanisms\namong\nother\nprojects.\nThe\nAuthority also advises the GoK on various\nMultilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs)\nthat should be ratified, domesticated and\nimplemented for the benefits of the country. In\naddition the Authority chairs the interministerial committee overseeing performance\ncontracts required by GoK from the Ministries\nDepartments and Agencies (MDAs) to report on\nEnvironmental sustainability on a quarterly\nbasis and annually.\nThe above platforms strengthen NEMA’s\nmandate as the lead institution in spearheading\nthe national communications process and\nconducting inter-ministerial coordination.\nThe Second National Communication (SNC)\nwork has built on the work done under the First\nNational Communication (FNC), NCCRS, NCCAP,\nthe draft NAP and Kenya’s Vision 2030. Figure\n25 below shows the current institutional set up\nfor the preparation of the SNC.

The annual emissions per\ncapita (without LULUCF) gradually decreased\nfrom 1.5 tCO2e in 1996 to 1.3 tCO2e in 1998,\nwhere it stabilised until 2012. A similar trend\nwas observed for the GHG emissions per capita\nincluding LULUCF.\n\nThe challenge of climate change is likely to\ncompound these trends. There is increasing\nevidence that climate change is directly\naffecting\nthe\nsocial,\neconomic\nand\nenvironmental status of the country. The World\nBank affirms that “poverty and vulnerability to\nclimate change remain the most critical\ndevelopment challenges facing Kenya.”115\n\n50\n\nTable 8: National economic indicators\nIndicator\n1996\n1998\n2012\n\nPopulation (millions)\n28\n28.7\n41.8\nAnnual GHG emissions per capita\n(excluding LULUCF) in tCO2\n1.5\n1.3\n1.3\nAnnual GHG emissions per capita\n(including LULUCF) in tCO2\n2.0\n1.9\n1.8\nEstimated share of informal sector in\nGDP(percentage)\n6.1\n8.2\n25\nRelevant area (square kilometres)\n582,646\n582,646\n582,646\nShare of manufacturing industry in\nGDP (percentage)\n13.8\n16\n8.9\nShare of services in GDP (percentage)\n59\n60.2\n48\nShare of agriculture in GDP\n(percentage)\n25\n26\n26\nLand area used for agricultural\npurposes (million square kilometres)\n52,047\n52,047\n52,047\nUrban population as percentage of\ntotal\n29\n33.6\n32 (2012)\nLivestock population (000)\n29,961\n29,961\n67,454\nForest area (square kilometres)\n20,310\n20,310\n20,509\n(2010)\nPopulation in national absolute\npoverty (percentage)\n48\n48.02\n46\nLife expectancy at birth (years)\n59.9 (1989)\n59.5 (1989)\n60.37 (2011)\nLiteracy rate (percentage)\n73.4\n78\n74 (2007)\nSources: 1st NC; Economic Report 2013; 2nd MTP; NCCAP; State of Environment Report 2009; Planning\nCommission, 2007; Kenya National Human Development Report 2013\n\n51\n\nREFERENCES\nAlkire, S., Roche, J.M., Santos, M.E. & Seth, S.\n(2011).

In\nOctober 2002, Kenya submitted their first\ninventory\nwith\nKenya’s\nFirst\nNational\nCommunication (FNC). The FNC inventory was\nprepared for the reference year 1994 in\ncompliance with Articles 4 and 12 of the\nUNFCCC\nand\nin\naccordance\nwith\nthe\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) Guidelines of 1996.\n\nThis chapter presents Kenya’s greenhouse gas\n(GHG) emissions and removals by sinks for the\nyear 2000, as well as additional years between\n1995 and 2010 in accordance with the\nrecommendation of the Intergovernmental\nPanel\non\nClimate\nChange\n(IPCC).\nThe\ngreenhouse gas Inventory was conducted on an\nindividual sector basis for the Energy; Industrial\nProcesses;\nSolvent\nand\nProduct\nUse;\nAgriculture; Land Use, Land-Use Change and\nForestry (LULUCF); and Waste Sectors. The\ngreenhouse gases included are Carbon Dioxide\n(CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O) and\npartially fluorinated hydrocarbons (HFCs) not\ncovered under the Montreal Protocol. Indirect\ngreenhouse\ngases\nincluding\nNon-Methane\nVolatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC), Carbon\nMonoxide (CO) Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and\nSulphur Dioxide (SO2) are also reported as they\nhave an important influence on chemical\nreactions in the atmosphere.\n\nThe IPCC Revised 1996 Guidelines for National\nGreenhouse Gas Inventories (Volumes 1, 2 and\n3) and the Good Practice Guidance and\nUncertainty\nManagement\nin\nNational\nGreenhouse Gas Inventories were used as the\nbasis to undertake the necessary calculations on\nGHG Emissions and Removals. The use of these\nIPCC Guidelines for all years fulfils the objective\nof the Conference of the Parties for the use of\n\ncomparable methodologies. In accordance with\nthe\nGuidelines,\nCO2\nemissions\nfrom\nInternational Bunkers and burning of biomass\nare not included in the national totals, but are\nreported separately as Memo Items in the\nInventory.\n\nComplete\ndocumentation\nof\nmethods, activity data and emission factors\nalong with references of all data sources are\nreported in Kenya’s National GHG Inventory\nReport 2010.\n\nThe calculation of emissions was assisted using\nUNFCCC’s Non-Annex I National Greenhouse\nGas Inventory Software (version 1.3.2). Annex A\nof the SNC presents the standard reporting\ntables for the years 2000, 2005 and 2010.\n\nThe chapter starts with energy sector for which\nthe methodology, the activity data, the GHG\nemissions and the indirect GHG emissions are\ndiscussed. The other sectors follow with\ndiscussions under the same topics after which,\nthe\ninventory\ngaps,\nneeds\nand\nrecommendations are presented. The chapter\nthen analyses the key sources, uncertainty and\nimprovements between the FNC and the SNC.\nIt concludes with a summary of the GHG\nemissions and removals.\n\nSUMMARY OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\nAND REMOVALS\n\nThis section provides an overall summary of\ngreenhouse gas emissions for Kenya between\n1995 and 2010. Greenhouse gas emissions are\nexpressed as CO2e (Carbon Dioxide Equivalent)\nby IPCC sectors. The carbon dioxide equivalent\nis calculated using the 100 year global warming\npotentials for specific gases that are identified\nfor use with the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines.\n\nFigure 26 and Figure 27 indicates the relative\ncontribution of the four main greenhouse gases\n(i.e., CO2, CH4, N2O and HFCs) to total emissions\nfor each of the inventory years 1995, 2000,\n2005 and 2010.\n\n56\n\nFigure 26: Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions expressed in CO2e Excluding LULUCF (Gg)\n0.0\n10.0\n20.0\n30.0\n40.0\n50.0\n60.0\n70.0\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nEmissions Megatonnes CO2e\nHFC\nN2O\nCO2\nCH4\n\nFigure 27: Total Greenhouse Gas Emissions expressed in CO2e Including LULUCF (Gg)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nEmissions Megatonnes CO2e\nHFC\nN2O\nCH4\nCO2\n\nOverall greenhouse gas emissions in Kenya have\nincreased over the past fifteen years but not at\na rate above the average economic growth of\n3.5% (World Bank, 2014). Average annual\ngrowth in emissions excluding LULUCF was 2.2%\nper year, with LULUCF it was 3.0% per year.\n\nTotal CO2e emissions for the year 2010 are\nestimated to be 48.4 megatons (Mt) without\nthe contribution from LULUCF. This is an\nincrease from 1995 of 13.5 Mt or 38%. With the\nLULUCF sector, total CO2e emissions rise to 69.5\nMt in 2010, an increase from 1995 of 25 Mt or\n56%. Emission growth is primarily driven by\nincreased demand for fossil fuels in the energy\nsector and by increased emissions in the\nLULUCF sector. Energy emissions grew at an\naverage rate of 4.1% per year while LULUCF\n\n57\n\nemissions grew at an average rate of 5.3% per\nyear between 1995 and 2010. Agriculture\nemissions grew much more slowly at an average\nrate of 1.3% per year. Waste and industrial\nprocess emissions account for less than 6% of\noverall emissions and grew at an average\nannual rate of 2.3% and 6.1% respectively\nbetween 1995 and 2010.\nTrends in total CO2e emissions for each IPCC\ncategory for the complete time series 1995 to\n2010 are shown in Figure 28 excluding the\nLULUCF sector. Figure 29 identifies the\nemissions profile with the LULUCF sector.\n\nFigure 28: Greenhouse Gas Emissions in MtCO2e excluding LULUCF (1995-2010)\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nWaste\nIndustrial\nProcesses\nEnergy\nAgriculture\n\nFigure 29: Greenhouse Gas Emissions in MtCO2e including LULUCF (1995-2010\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nWaste\nIndustrial\nProcesses\nEnergy\nLULUCF\nAgriculture\nGreenhouse gas emission contributions by\nsector and greenhouse gas are summarized in\nTable 10 for the year 2010.

In the case of biomass fuels\n(firewood, charcoal and agricultural residues),\nCO2 emissions are not accounted for in total\nenergy sector emissions. Renewable fuels do\nnot generate net emissions and emissions\nassociated with the non-renewable part are\nincluded in the Land-Use Change and Forestry\nsector.\n\nCO2 emissions from combustion of fuels\nsupplied\nfor\ninternational\nwater-borne\nnavigation and international aviation (the socalled bunker fuels) are reported in accordance\nwith Decision 17/CP.8, but not accounted for in\ntotal energy sector emissions.\n\nThe Energy sector also includes fugitive\nemissions\nfrom\nfossil\nfuel\nproduction,\ntransportation and processing. In Kenya’s case\nthis includes emissions from the refining of\ncrude oil into petroleum products, as well as,\nNMVOC emission from the storage and\nhandling of crude oil.\n\nKenya did not have primary fossil fuel\nproduction before 2010 but has had an active\nrefinery\nthat\nmanufacturers\nsecondary\npetroleum products from imported crude.\nAdditional fuels for consumption are imported\nincluding coal from South Africa. Demand for\npetroleum fuels has steadily increased since\n2000 at an average annual rate of 3.4%. The\nhighest growth in demand was related to the\ntransportation sector. Electricity generation\nhas also grown at a similar pace over the same\ntimeframe and renewable resources such as\nhydro and geothermal that are not estimated to\ngenerate significant greenhouse gas emissions\nrepresent an average of about 70% of total\ngeneration between 2000 and 2010. However,\nthe electricity generation mix can fluctuate as\nhydro generation has varied substantially in\nrecent years due to unreliable water levels.\n\nThe national consumption of fossil and biomass\nfuels is identified in Table 11. Data on fossil\nfuels was provided primarily by the Ministry of\nEnergy. Estimates of biomass consumption\nwere based on a number of different studies\nand\nare\nconsistent\nwith\nan\nIntegrated\nAssessment of the Energy Policy conducted by\nKamfor Consultants completed in 2006.\n\n59\n\nTable 2: Domestic Consumption of Fuels (1000’s tonnes of product) (1995-2010)\nType\nFuel\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\nPrimary\nFossil Fuels1\nCrude Oil\n1,382.6\n2,043.8\n1,774.0\n1,643.2\n1,598.7\n1,687.7\n1,610.1\n1,551.5\nBit.

Despite Agriculture’s declining\nproportion of the overall economic activity in\nKenya, livestock numbers and crop production\nhave increased. The cattle population has\nincreased marginally by 8% in that time, but\nother livestock populations including sheep,\ngoat and camels have increased by more than\n40%. Production of wheat and maize crops have\nincreased by 64% and 103%, respectively.\n\nAgricultural activities contribute to greenhouse\ngas emissions through a variety of different\nprocesses. CH4 and N2O are the only significant\ngreenhouse gases emitted by the Agriculture\nSector. CH4 emissions arise from enteric\nfermentation\nand\nmanure\nmanagement\nassociated with livestock, as well as, rice\ncultivation and prescribed burning of savannah\nand crop residues. N2O Emissions arise primarily\nfrom synthetic and natural fertilizers (i.e.,\nmanure, crop residues) applied to cultivated\nsoils and are based on IPCC assumptions\n\n67\n\nregarding atmospheric deposition and leaching\nfrom soils. Other N2O emission sources include\nrice cultivation and prescribed burning of\nsavannah and crop residues and are based on\nland areas or production quantities combined\nwith default IPCC emission factors.

The\ndataset that is employed is from the Food and\nAgricultural Organization (FAO) of the United\nNations Global Forest Resource Assessment\n2010 for Kenya. This method is described as\nApproach 1 in the 2003 IPCC Good Practice\nGuidance for LULUCF.\nThe general method for calculating fluxes of CO2\nto or from the atmosphere and biomass carbon\npools is the same as outlined in the 1996\nRevised IPCC Guidelines. These fluxes are\n\n71\n\nestimated using a state and transition model\nthat parameterizes and defines changes in landuse, land-use management and disturbances\nlike wildfire to estimate annual fluxes over a\ntwenty year historic period between 1990 and\n2010. The inventory considers all forests in\nKenya as managed forest where forest\nmanagement is defined as the process of\nplanning and implementing practices for\nstewardship and use of the forest aimed at\nfulfilling relevant ecological, economic and\nsocial functions of the forest.\nThe carbon pools represented in the model are\nconsistent with IPCC Guidelines and include\nabove-ground biomass, below-ground biomass,\nsoil organic matter and the atmosphere. More\ndetail on the modelling is provided in Kenya’s\n2010 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report.\n\nLand Representation and Activity Data\n\nThe FAO Global Forest Resource Assessment for\nKenya\npresents\nland-use\ndata\nthat\nhas\nconsistent representation over a twenty year\ntime period and is complete and covers all of\nthe land area within Kenya. Although the data\nis not country derived or spatially explicit it is\npublicly available and transparent. Land-uses\nidentified can be mapped at a high level to the\nsix IPCC land-use categories (forest land,\ncropland, grassland, wetlands, settlement and\nother land). Land-use types and historic areas\nare presented in Table 22 below.\n\nTable 23: Areas of different land-use categories and State Classifications between 1990 and 2010\nFAO Land-Use\nCategories\nModelling Land-Use\nState Classifications\n(IPCC Class)\nArea (000 hectares)\nChange in\nArea (000\nhectares)\nfrom 1990 to\n2010\n1990\n2000\n2005\n2010\nIndigenous Closed\nCanopy\nForest (Forest land)\n1,240\n1,190\n1,165\n1,140\n-100\nIndigenous\nMangroves\nMangrove (Forest land)\n80\n80\n80\n80\n0\nOpen Woodlands\nWoodland (Forest land)\n2,150\n2,100\n2,075\n2,050\n-100\nPlantation Forests –\nPublic\nPlant Public (Forest land)\n170\n134\n119\n1,381\n-32\nPlantation Forests –\nPrivate\nPlant Private (Forest\nland)\n68\n78\n83\n94\n26\nBush-land\nBushland (Grassland)\n24,800\n24,635\n24,570\n24,510\n-290\nGrasslands – Other\nLand\nGrassland (Grassland)\n6,438\n6,291\n6,210\n6,210\n-228\nGrasslands – Other\nWooded Land\nGrassland (Grassland)\n3,863\n4,194\n4,140\n4,140\n-137\nSettlements\nSettlement\n(Settlements)\n8,256\n8,192\n8,152\n8,202\n-54\nFarms\nFarms (Cropland)\n9,420\n10,020\n10,320\n10,385\n965\nInland Water Bodies\nOther Land (Other land)\n1,123\n1,123\n1,123\n1,123\n-\nTotal Area for\nCountry\n\n58,037\n58,037\n58,037\n58,037\n-\nSource: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (2010).

It is estimated that overall, living\nbiomass carbon stocks declined from 829 MT of\nCarbon in 1990 to 760 MT of Carbon in 2010.\nSoil carbon stocks were estimated to decline\nonly slightly from 3,016 MT of carbon in 1990 to\n3,015 Mt of carbon in 2010.\n\nIndirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nIndirect greenhouse gas emissions of NOX and\nCO are the result of vegetation fires. Table 27\nidentifies these emissions over time.\n\nTable 28: Total LULUCF Indirect GHG Emissions from Vegetation Fires (Gg)\nIndirect GHG Emissions\nSector in IPCC\nGuidelines\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\nNOX\n5E\n0.18\n0.18\n0.18\n0.17\nCO\n5E\n256.9\n251.1\n256.3\n250\n\n75\n\nWaste\n\nWastes through the processes of disposal,\ntreatment, recycling and incineration produce\ngreenhouse gas emissions. The most important\ngas produced in this source category is methane\n(CH4). Two major sources of this type of CH4\nproduction are solid waste disposal to land and\nwastewater\ntreatment.\nIn\neach\ncase,\nmethanogenic bacteria break down organic\nmatter in the waste to produce CH4. The\nemission potential increases the better the\ndisposal site control conditions are and the\ngreater the depth of the solid waste.\nWastewater emission potential increases for\nwastewater that is treated in anaerobic\nconditions and has a high degree of organic\ncontent, such as those from the residential and\ncommercial\nsectors,\nfood\nand\nbeverage\nindustries and from the pulp and paper\nindustry.\n\nWaste incineration, like other forms of\ncombustion, generates CO2 as well as smaller\namounts of CH4 and N2O emissions, depending\non the composition of the waste. The\nbreakdown of human sewage can also lead to\nsignificant amounts of indirect N2O emissions.\n\nThe calculation of methane emissions from\nSolid\nWaste\nDisposal Sites\n(SWDS)\nwas\ncompleted using the Tier 1 First Order Decay\n(FOD) Model methodology from the 2006 IPCC\nGuidelines. The FOD method produces a timedependent emission profile that better reflects\nthe true pattern of the degradation process\nover time, as opposed to the default method\nthat assumes all potential CH4 is released in the\nyear the waste is disposed. The 2006 Waste\nModel spreadsheet developed by the IPCC was\nemployed to estimate emissions between 1995\nand 2010.

The most important emission sources\nwere both related to agriculture, and primarily,\nto livestock. Enteric Fermentation accounted for\n\n30% of emissions and N2O emissions from\nagricultural soils accounted for 25% of overall\nemissions. The major contributor to N2O\nemissions from agricultural soils is manure\napplied or left on agricultural lands.

These\nuncertainties include the lack of precision of\nactivity data to incomplete knowledge of the\nprocesses that cause emissions or removals of\ngreenhouse gases. The 2000 Good Practice\nGuidance recognizes that the uncertainty of\nestimates cannot be completely eliminated and\nthat the main objective should be to produce\naccurate estimates, i.e., estimates that are\nneither underestimated nor overestimated,\n\n81\n\nwhile at the same time, whenever possible\nseeking to improve estimate precision.\nIn accordance with the recommendations, an\nattempt was made in the inventory to ensure\nthat estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and\nremovals were not biased. Estimate precision\nvaried depending on each sector’s available\ndata as well as resources that could be\ninvestigated for determining emission factors\nthat suited circumstances in Kenya. Where\nemissions and removals were identified in the\nkey category analysis as the most important\noverall, emphasis was given, where possible, to\nensuring that the best activity data and\nemission factors available were used.\n\nThe overall Inventory uncertainty is the result of\nthe uncertainty associated with all activity and\nemission factor data and other parameters used\nin the estimates. For most sectors, it was not\npossible to conduct a detailed uncertainty\nanalysis,\nsince\nthat\nwould\ndemand\na\nconsiderable effort in analyzing the accuracy\nand precision of basic information used.\nNevertheless, a general evaluation of Inventory\nprecision\nwas\nconducted\nbased\non\nthe\njudgment\nand\nknowledge\nof\ninventory\nspecialists. The objective was to identify sources\nof emissions and removals where additional\nresources could be used in the future to reduce\nthe level of overall uncertainty. The precision\nassociated with activity data and emission\nfactors, as well as emission or removal\nestimates, is expressed as a ± a given\npercentage based on a 95% confidence interval\nlimit.\n\nTable 45 details the results of the analysis of\nuncertainty\nfor\nemission\nand\nremoval\nestimates. More detailed descriptions of\nuncertainties are provided in the sectoral level\ninventory reports.\n\nThe highest uncertainty of emission estimates\nwhen considering both uncertainty with activity\ndata and emissions factors is related to the\nestimates of the carbon stocks of forest (i.e.,\nForest Land Remaining Forest Land) in the\nLULUCF sector. The combined uncertainty as a\npercentage of total national emissions in 2010 is\n17.5%. The next highest source is related to\ndirect and indirect emissions of N2O from\nagricultural soils. The combined uncertainty as a\npercentage of total national emissions in 2010\nfor this source is 8.4%.\n\nTable 36: Tier 1 Uncertainty Calculations and Reporting\nIPCC Source Category\nGas\nYear\nemissions\n2010\nActivity data\nuncertainty\nEmission\nfactor\nuncertainty\nCombined\nUncertainty\nCombined\nuncertainty as\n% of total\nnational\nemissions in\nyear 2010\n\nGg CO2\nequivalent\n%\n%\n%\n%\n1.A Fossil Fuel Combustion\nCO2\n11,755\n10\n5\n11.2\n1.83\nCH4\n4,137\n60\n50\n78.1\n4.49\nN2O\n1,299\n60\n100\n116.6\n2.10\n1.B Fugitive Emissions\nCH4\n1\n10\n50\n51.0\n0.00\n2.A.1 Cement Production\nCO2\n1,849\n2\n35\n35.1\n0.90\n2.A.2 Lime Production\nCO2\n35\n20\n2\n20.1\n0.01\n2.A.4 Soda Ash Production and Use\nCO2\n243\n20\n20\n28.3\n0.10\n2.F Consumption of Halocarbons\nHFC\n82\n100\n0\n100.0\n0.11\n4.A Enteric Fermentation\nCH4\n14,540\n10\n30\n31.6\n6.39\n\n82\n\n4.B Manure Management\nCH4\n541\n10\n20\n22.4\n0.17\nN2O\n225\n10\n50\n51.0\n0.16\n4.C Rice Cultivation\nCH4\n278\n10\n40\n41.2\n0.16\n4.D Agricultural Soils\nN2O\n11,890\n10\n50\n51.0\n8.42\n4.E Prescribed Burning of Agricultural\nResidues\nCH4\n1,667\n40\n20\n44.7\n1.04\nN2O\n304\n40\n20\n44.7\n0.19\n4.F Field Burning of Agricultural Residues\nCH4\n105\n50\n50\n70.7\n0.10\nN2O\n31\n50\n50\n70.7\n0.03\n5.A.1 Forest Land Remaining Forest Land\nCO2\n16,821\n69\n30\n75.0\n17.53\nCH4\n3\n30\n70\n76.2\n0.00\nN2O\n0\n30\n70\n76.2\n0.00\n5.B.1 Cropland Remaining Cropland\nCO2\n615\n40\n70\n80.6\n0.69\n5.B.2 Land Converted to Cropland\nCO2\n3,560\n69\n30\n75.0\n3.71\n5.C.1 Grassland Remaining Grassland\nCO2\n179\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.19\n5.E.1 Settlements Remaining Settlements\nCO2\n-85\n69\n30\n75.0\n-0.09\n6.A Solid Waste Disposal on Land\nCH4\n277\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.29\n6.B.1 Industrial Wastewater\nCH4\n348\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.36\n6.B.2 Domestic and Commercial\nWastewater\nCH4\n601\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.63\nN2O\n664\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.69\n6.C Waste Incineration\nCO2\n7\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.01\nCH4\n0\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.00\nN2O\n0.2\n69\n30\n75.0\n0.00\n\nTOTAL\n71,974\n\nThe results in Table 44 suggest that efforts to\nreduce the overall uncertainty of Kenya’s\ngreenhouse gas inventory could be focused on\nonly a few emission sources.

The primary activity required is\nto improve the overall understanding of\ncarbon stocks in forests. The representation\nof forest lands in the inventory should be\nimproved.

Included in report will be\nthe new categories for land representation. In\naddition, careful monitoring through the\nexamination of regular and consistent geospatial data should be conducted to improve\nestimates of forest land-use changes. It is\nessential that data be collected to link landuse changes from the available GIS data to\nabove ground biomass stocks, biomass\ngrowth and biomass removals. As part of this\neffort detailed surveys should be undertaken\nto\nascertain\nthe\namount\nof\nbiomass\n(fuelwood, wood for charcoal, commercial\nharvesting) that is removed from forests and\ntheir geographic distribution.

N2O\nemissions are driven by the application of\nmanure to soils, or simply by manure from\npasture being left on grazing lands. The use of\nagricultural\nresidues\nas\na\nfertilizer\nenhancement also contributes to significant\nN2O emissions. Improving the estimates of\nlivestock\npopulations\nand\ndetermining\ncountry specific rates of nitrogen excretion\nfrom livestock will greatly improve the overall\nestimates. Country-specific Tier 2 level\nnitrogen excretion rates for different livestock\ncategories describe the annual average\nnitrogen excretion for each livestock species\nin the country in kg N/animal/yr. N excretion\nrates can be derived from N intake and N\nretention data. This typically requires the\ngross\nenergy\nintake\nof\nthe\nanimal\n(MJ/animal/day), the percent crude protein in\nthe diet, milk production for dairy cattle and\nweight gain per day. In addition, improving\nestimates of overall quantities of nitrogen\nfertilizers and agricultural residues applied as\na fertilizer to fields would reduce overall\nuncertainty.\n\nx Enteric Fermentation. Tier 1 emission factors\nare used in the analysis and the adoption of a\nTier 2 methodology emission factors would\nsignificantly improve the quality of the\nestimates. The use of a Tier 2 methodology\nwould require the development of country\nspecific emission factors based on enhanced\nlivestock characteristics. Data required to\ndevelop country specific emission factors\nincludes average daily feed intake or\nalternatively weight, average weight gain per\nday, feeding conditions, milk production, fat\ncontent of milk, percentage of females that\ngive birth, number of offspring and feed\ndigestibility. It is recommended that this is\npursued for dairy and non-dairy cattle\nlivestock as this represents 67% of total\nenteric\nfermentation\nemissions.\nImprovements\nin\nestimates\nof\noverall\nlivestock populations would also reduce\nuncertainty.\n\nx Fossil Fuel Combustion. Uncertainty in fossil\nfuel combustion emissions is driven by the\nuncertainty in the consumption of fuelwood\nand charcoal in Kenya. A new national survey\nto characterize wood removal for energy\nconsumption is imperative to improving the\nquality of the data. Surveys should be\nconducted for both consumers and producers\nof fuelwood and charcoal. A comparison of\ntop-down end-use surveys with estimates of\nbottom-up harvesting and production could\nsignificantly\nreduce\nuncertainty.\nCH4\nemissions from the residential sector which is\nthe fifth most important key category is\ndominated by emissions related to biomass\ncombustion.\n\nx Carbon emissions from land converted to\ncropland. New land-use data information\ngathered for Croplands should be examined\nto determine whether assumptions that\napproximately 5,000 ha per year of natural\nForest Land as well as large areas of\nWoodlands and Bushlands were converted to\ncroplands between 1990 and 2010. This data\nlikely now exists with the Kenya Forest\nService. In addition, it is important to\nimprove estimates of how much carbon is\nreleased in relation to these conversions.\n\nINVENTORY GAPS, NEEDS AND\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nA number of significant gaps, needs and\nconstraints\nwere\nidentified\nduring\nthe\npreparation\nof\nthe\nSecond\nNational\nCommunication (SNC) inventory for Kenya.\nGaps include not only information on activity\ndata, but also resources and capacity. There is a\nstrong need for institutional capacity building\nand training of government staff to do the\nnecessary data collection and analysis required\nto reduce inventory uncertainties and improve\nthe quality of activity data and emission factors\nused to generate the inventory.\n\n84\n\nThe sub-sections below summarize specific\ngaps, needs and recommendations associated\nwith activity data collection, capacity building\nand development of an integrated and\nsustainable Greenhouse Gas Inventory System.\nActivity Data Collection\nKey data gaps that were identified in regards to\nactivity data and are outlined in Table 46 below\nand are organized by IPCC Sector. Specific\nrecommendations are also provided that could\nbe followed to address the data gaps.\n\nTable 37: Key Inventory Activity Data Gaps and Recommendations\nIPCC Sector\nKey Activity Data Gap Identified\nRecommendation for Addressing Data Gap\nEnergy\nNational energy balances, including imports,\nexports, consumption and international\nbunker data for major economic sectors are\nnot available (e.g., residential, commercial,\ntransportation etc).\nNational energy balances should be routinely\nprepared by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum\nand should include biomass fuels.\nEstimates of woodfuel and charcoal\nconsumption have very high uncertainty and\nare not based on recent surveys.\nA comprehensive nation-wide bottom-up survey of\nproducers and a top-down survey of consumers\nshould be conducted (by Kenya Forest Service) to\nreduce the level of uncertainty associated with\nproduction and demand for woodfuel and charcoal.\nIndustrial\nProcesses\nLime production data is based on an\ninternational agency source (US Geological\nSurvey)\nCountry-level data should be collected by the\nindustry sub-sector (at Kenya Association of\nManufactures or KEPSA) and available from the\nKenya National Bureau of Statistics.\nInformation on the amount of HFCs imported\nannually in bulk and in products is not\ncomplete and has a high degree of\nuncertainty. Bulk imports of HFCs are tracked\nby NEMA using customs excise data;\nhowever, the reliability of the data is low as\nthere are problems with the assignment of\nappropriate HS Codes and information that\nclearly identifies the type of HFC or other\nozone depleting substance that is being\nimported.\n\nAdditional training and support should be provided\nto customs agents so that there is a reliable tracking\nsystem for HFCs. The primary route of entry for HFCs\nis through products and surveys should be\nconducted to reliably estimate the number of HFC\ncontaining products imported and the charge and\ntype of HFCs in associated air conditioning,\nrefrigeration and aerosol products.\nSolvent and\nProduct Use\nInformation on solvents and paints imported\nis difficult to obtain and collate so that it can\nbe used in inventory work. While customs\ntracks imports through HS Codes, the\ndatabase is not easily accessible.\nData should be made available in electronic format\nand summarize annual quantities in consistent units\nof different solvents and paints associated with\nspecific HS Codes.\n\nInformation on bulk imports of nitrous oxide\nwere not available for the inventory\nBulk imports of nitrous oxide gas should be tracked\nby customs and provided in electronic format\nindicating annual quantities imported.\n\n85\n\nIPCC Sector\nKey Activity Data Gap Identified\nRecommendation for Addressing Data Gap\nAgriculture\nData on the fraction of different livestock that\nare managed under different animal waste\nmanagement systems is lacking and default\ndata was used.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries\nshould undertake an assessment to accurately\ndetermine the fraction of different livestock that are\nmanaged under different animal waste management\nsystems.\nPrescribed burning of Savannah was\nestimated from IPCC defaults, but it is\nsuspected that burning practices have\nsignificantly changed over the years which\nmay have reduced burning from historic\nlevels.\nThe Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries\nshould undertake an assessment of the burning of\nsavannah to determine if the estimated areas\nburned represent existing management conditions\nin Kenya.\nPrescribed burning of crop residues was\nestimated for four major crops (maize, rice,\ncorn and sugarcane).\nThe Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries\nshould review the assumptions regarding prescribed\nburning of crop residues and if necessary conduct\nsurveys to estimate the extent of the practice for\ndifferent crops.\nLULUCF\nChanges in land-use were estimated using a\nforest orientated dataset of land-use\nclassification from the Food and Agricultural\nOrganization (FAO). The data was used\nbecause it was the best available at the time\nthe inventory work was conducted.\nThe Kenya Forest Service (KFS) is working to develop\na national land classification system aligned with\nIPCC Guidance and could become the future basis of\nestimating removals and emissions from the LULUCF\nsector. KFS is working on the National Forest\nInventory, which will be able to inform the next GHG\nInventory work. Continued research and effort is\nrequired to link the land-use changes indicated in\nthis report to biomass stocks and changes in carbon\npools.\nEstimates of wood removal from forests for\nwoodfuel and charcoal are unreliable and not\nbased on recent surveys.\nWork on estimates of woodfuel removal and\ncharcoal production identified for the energy sector\nwould greatly enhance the robustness of the\nremoval and emission estimates of the LULUCF\nsector. This work could be run by the Kenya Forest\nService\nWaste\nEstimates of domestic and industrial solid\nwaste sent to solid waste management sites\nhave a high degree of uncertainty. The\ninventory work draws on the environmental\nassessments for four solid waste disposal\nsites within Kenya.\nThe National Environment management Authority\nshould collect and provide data on the amount of\nwaste deposited annually. This data should be\nestimated either through weigh scale records or\nrecords of the number of vehicle loads.\n\n86\n\nIPCC Sector\nKey Activity Data Gap Identified\nRecommendation for Addressing Data Gap\nThe total degradable organic content of\nindustrial wastewater was estimated based\non the production (tonnes) of different\nproducts that typically generate high volumes\nof industrial wastewater. High level\nassumptions were made regarding the type of\ntreatment facilities in place. The National\nEnvironment management Authority has\nadditional data on more than a 1,000\nwastewater treatment facilities that could be\nreviewed.\nNEMA could undertake a review of existing data on\nindustrial wastewater treatment sites to generate\nmore reliable estimates of the total degradable\norganic content of industrial wastewater produced\nand the associated type of treatment.\n\nCapacity Building\n\nCapacity building is required at both the\ninstitutional and personnel level and multisectoral representation (i.e., Energy, Industrial\nProcesses,\nSolvent\nand\nProduct\nUse,\nAgriculture, LULUCF and Waste) is critical.\nAlthough some initial and basic training on\ngreenhouse gas inventory work has been\nprovided under the Ministry of Environment\nWater and natural Resources through the UNDP\nsponsored Low Emission Capacity Building\nProgramme, it is recommended that training\nworkshops be conducted as part of future\ngreenhouse gas inventory work to provide both\nto government staff and local consultants\nsectoral level training. The workshops should\nfocus on familiarizing a wide audience of\nstakeholders with inventory methodologies and\ntools, engaging them in the data collection\nprocess and providing them with hands-on\nexperience with inventory data, methods and\ntools. The ultimate objective should be such\nthat appointed government staff can complete\nall aspects of inventory work with limited\noutside consultancy.\n\nDifferent national and county government\ndepartments and organizations integral to\ninformation gathering for the different sectors\n(e.g., Ministry of Agriculture Livestock and\nFisheries, Kenya Forest Service, Ministry of\nEnergy and Petroleum and the Kenya Revenue\nAuthority) need to develop capacity to continue\nsupporting GHG inventories. One suggested\napproach is to provide training for sector leads\nfrom each of the six major sink/source\ncategories (Energy, Industrial Processes, Solvent\nand Product Use, Agriculture, Land-Use Change\n& Forestry, and Waste). It is recommended that\nat the beginning of the development of future\ninventories\nthat\nresponsibilities,\nroles,\nresources and training for sectoral teams be\nclearly identified. Sustainable Development and\nEnvironment\nStaff,\nwho\nare\nultimately\nresponsible\nfor\nthe\npreparation\nof\nthe\ninventory, should be exposed to all sector\ntraining so as to serve as local assistance to\nnational experts.\n\nThe capacity building should be designed to\nestablish ongoing data collection and analysis in\nall the relevant government ministries and\ndepartments, should include the necessary\nprivate sector participation at both association\nand industry sector levels.\n\nSustainable Greenhouse Gas Inventory\nSystems\n\nDeveloping a sustainable GHG Inventory system\nshould be a key objective for Kenya to address\nthe challenge of more frequent and demanding\n\n87\n\nreporting of inventories to the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC).\nFrequent,\naccurate,\nconsistent,\ncomplete and transparent reporting for Kenya is\ncrucial for not only meeting international\nobligations but for the assessment of Nationally\nAppropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) and\nfor projecting global progress towards targets\nto stop dangerous climate change warming.\n\nIn the context of more frequent reporting of\nnational GHG inventories by non-Annex I\nParties, it is imperative that the preparation\nprocess shift from a project-based approach to\na more internalized and institutionalized\napproach (UNFCCC, 2012). This shift would\nsupport the timely delivery of the required\ninformation and more efficient use of available\nresources by Parties. Experience in Kenya has\ndemonstrated that because the development of\ngreenhouse gas inventories has been conducted\non an ad-hoc basis with the use of consultants\nthere has been a “memory loss” between the\npreparation of the INC and the SNC and\ninsufficient capacity developed within internal\nstructures. Clear records of activity data used in\nthe INC and methodologies followed were not\nalways retained which makes it difficult to\nvalidate previous assumptions and update the\ninventory.\n\nInsufficient evidence and documentation of\nquality control/quality assurance also brought\ninto question the reliability of the existing 1994\nInventory. In addition lessons learned from the\npreparation of the INC were not passed on in an\neffective manner since methodological choices\nwere not always explained.\n\nKey components of a sustainable GHG have\nbeen identified by IPCC and UNFCCC guidelines\nand are indicated below:\n\nx\nInstitutional Arrangements;\nx\nMethods and Data Documentation;\nx\nQA/QC Procedures;\nx\nArchiving;\nx\nKey Category Analysis; and,\nx\nInventory improvement planning.\n\nA brief description of each of these components\nfollows; however, any system must be tailored\nto account for national circumstances and\nconstraints.\nFurther\ndetails\nof\nthese\ncomponents are available from the United\nStates Environmental Protection Agency’s (US\nEPA’s) approach to building sustainable national\nGHG inventory management systems using predefined National System Templates.\n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\nInstitutional\nArrangements\nidentify\nhow\ndifferent organizations can work together for\ncollective action. These arrangements can\neither be formal or informal, and should include\nprovisions that define roles and responsibilities\nof all the organizations that are involved in the\ninventory preparation process including key\nstakeholders.\n\nClearly defining institutional arrangements can\nhelp inventory teams assess and document the\nstrengths\nand\nweaknesses\nof\nexisting\ninstitutional\narrangements\nfor\ninventory\ndevelopment so as to ensure continuity and\nintegrity\nof\nthe\ninventory,\npromote\ninstitutionalization of the inventory process,\nand\nfacilitate\nprioritization\nof\nfuture\nimprovements. Memoranda of Understanding\ncan be executed between the lead institution\nand lead sector institutions that clearly outlines\nthe expected deliverables and responsibilities\nand ensures that they have a mandate for\nongoing contributions to the preparations of\nthe\ninventories.\nThrough\nclearly\ndefined\ninstitutional arrangements, it will be easy to\nassess the existing capacity gaps and how to\naddress them.\n\nA sustainable GHG inventory system is best\nserved by a strong lead institution that has a\nsound and capable expert team to develop\ninventories without extensive support from\n\n88\n\nexternal consultants.\n\nMethods and Data Documentation\n\nDocumenting the choice of methodologies and\nthe activity data and emission factors used to\nprepare estimates of greenhouse gas emissions\nand removals is critical to the transparency of\nthe inventory. Identifying documentation\nprocedures can assist inventory teams in\nreporting the origin of methodologies, activity\ndatasets, and emission factors used to estimate\nemissions or removals. Future inventory teams\ncan then refer to the documentation to\ndetermine what information was collected, how\nthe data were obtained, and what methods\nwere used, as well as to reproduce estimates.\n\nIn addition to this inventory report, individual\nsector level inventory reports have been\nprepared to clearly document all methods and\ndata for easy future reference.\n\nQA/QC Procedures\n\nQuality assurance (QA) is a planned system of\nreview procedures. It is performed by\npersonnel not directly involved in the inventory\ncompilation and development process. Quality\ncontrol (QC) is a system of routine technical\nactivities to assess and maintain the quality of\nthe inventory as it is being compiled. It is\nperformed by the personnel compiling the\ninventory. Identifying QA/QC procedures can\nhelp to establish a cost-effective QA/QC\nprogram\nthat\nimproves\ntransparency,\nconsistency, comparability, completeness, and\nconfidence in national GHG inventories.\n\nArchiving\n\nArchives refer to a collection of records in a\ngiven location that have been created during\nthe development of the inventory (references,\nmethodological\nchoice,\nexpert\ncomments,\nrevisions, etc.). An archive system helps to\nmake a national inventory transparent, allows\nestimates\nto\nbe\neasily\nreproduced\nand\nfacilitates\ndevelopment\nof\nsubsequent\ninventories by future inventory team members.\n\nA position of Archiving Officer within the lead\ninstitution should be considered to undertake\nthis task.\n\nKey Category Analysis\n\nKey category analysis (KCA) has been conducted\nfor this inventory and is presented in the\nprevious section. The KCA identifies the sources\nand/or sinks that have the greatest contribution\nto national emissions, and thus should be the\nfocus of improvement efforts. Resources should\nbe allocated to prioritize the necessary data\ncollection and development of country specific\nemission factors.\n\nInventory Improvement Plan\n\nThe concept of continual improvement is useful\nin developing inventories with the objective of\nincreasing\nthe\ntransparency,\nconsistency,\ncomparability, completeness and accuracy of\ninventories over time. Inventory improvement\nplanning is the process of developing specific\npriorities for future capacity-building projects\nbased on the needs identified for each of the\nkey components of sustainable GHG inventories\n(i.e., institutional arrangements, methods and\ndata\ndocumentation,\nQA/QC\nprocedures,\narchiving and Key Category Analysis. One of the\nkey inputs into the inventory improvement\nprocess should be feedback obtained through\nreviews of previous GHG Inventory reports.\n\nOTHER PLANS AND INTERVENTIONS\nPartnership of the GoK with Australia Aid and\nClinton Climate Initiative.\n\nThe\nSystem\nfor\nLand-based\nEmissions\n\n89\n\nEstimation in Kenya (SLEEK) is a Government of\nKenya\nprogram\nto\ndevelop\na\nrobust\nMeasurement, Reporting and Verification\n\nsystem to estimate land-based emissions in\nKenya\nand\nprovide\nthis\ndata\nto\ndrive\ndevelopment in the country.\n\nThe\nSystem\nfor\nLand-Based\nEmissions\nEstimation in Kenya (SLEEK) is a cutting-edge\nsystem that will track emissions in Kenya and\nfind innovative ways to deliver this information\nto Kenyans.\n\nSLEEK’s primary aim is to allow Kenya to\naccurately estimate and track its carbon\nemissions in the land sector. This includes\nforestry, agriculture, and other land uses. To do\nthis, it will bring together a wide range of data\nsources and scientific information – climate\ndata, models of Kenya’s plants and crops,\ninformation about the carbon content of our\nsoils and maps of land use.\n\nThe system will also play a key role in providing\ninformation to help Kenya respond to a range of\nother development challenges. This includes\nguiding Kenya’s reforestation effort, helping\nreduce emissions from agriculture, and helping\nKenya benefit from carbon markets.\n\nSLEEK will also help put better information in\nthe hands of farmers and communities. SLEEK\nwill provide data that can be used to develop\napps that can help farmers in a wide range of\nways, such as informing decisions about which\ncrop to plant, how many cattle their land can\nsupport, and where trees are most likely to\nsurvive.\n\nTo realise this ambitious agenda, SLEEK is\nbringing together scientists and policy makers\nfrom across the government, strengthening\ntheir capacity to share knowledge and work\nacross academic boundaries. The program is\nbeing delivered by the Ministry of Environment,\nWater and Natural Resources and is supported\nby the Government of Australia through the\nClinton Foundation.\n\nWhat’s MRV?\n Measurement,\nReporting\nand\nVerification\nsystems are used by countries to track their\ncarbon emissions and report changes to the\nUnited National Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC). They play an essential role in helping\ntackle climate change by providing essential\ninformation\nabout\na\ncountry’s\ncarbon\nemissions.\n\nSLEEK is Kenya’s Measurement, Reporting and\nVerification (MRV) system for the land-sector. It\nwill combine weather data, biological growth\nmodels\n(capturing\ncarbon\nemissions\nand\nsequestration from trees, crops and soils), and\nland cover maps to estimate the changes in\nKenya’s land-sector emissions over time. It will\nalso develop scenarios and models to assess\nchanges in carbon emissions in response to land\nuse changes.\n\nWhy does Kenya want a MRV system?\nWithout an accurate assessment of Kenya’s\nemissions it will be difficult to plan effective\npolicies to reduce emissions as well as benefit\nfrom\ninternational\nprograms\nto\nreduce\nemissions through stopping deforestation or\nimplementing clean growth policies. SLEEK will\nposition Kenya as a leader in emissions\nestimation and will provide a basis for other\ncountries in the region and across the world to\nlearn from Kenya.\n\nSLEEK is being delivered by wide range of\ninstitutions\nand\nMinistries\nacross\nthe\nGovernment of Kenya.\n\nThese institutions are working collaboratively\nthrough element working groups, which are\nteams that have been specially convened to\naddress each of the areas needed to build a\nMeasurement,\nReporting\nand\nVerification\n(MRV)\nsystem.\nThese\nteams\nare\nbeing\n\n90\n\ncoordinated by the Ministry of Environment,\nWater and Natural Resources and Natural\nResources.\nx Climate Parameters and Trends: This team is\ncompiling\ncomprehensive\nclimate\ndata\ncovering Kenya and scenarios showing how\nthis could change.\n\nThe Climate Parameters and Trends Element\nWorking Group is responsible for building\ncomprehensive climate maps that will allow\nSLEEK to estimate emissions at any location in\nKenya. These maps will show temperature,\nrainfall, solar radiation, frost and evaporation.\nTo complete this task, the team must\nextrapolate from Kenya’s weather stations\nusing\nnew\nsoftware\nthat\nis\nbeing\nimplemented in Kenya for the first time,\nwhich\nwill\nallow\nKenya\nto\ngenerate\ncomprehensive maps.\n\nThe Climate team will also develop scenarios\nand trends based on IPCC projections. This\nwill improve Kenya’s capacity to plan for the\nimpacts of a changing climate.\n\nA key part of the group’s work is to digitize\nover 1.8 million paper climate records that\nare currently stored in paper format. Once\nthese records are digitised, Kenya’s scientists\nwill have access to a far more complete\nclimate record that will allow them to run\nmore accurate analysis and models. This will\nhelp Kenya’s farmers, communities and land\nmanagers by providing them with more\naccurate weather data to help them make\nessential decisions\n\nx Crop Growth & Plant Parameters: This team\nis building models that will track carbon as\ncrops and plants grow.\n\nThe Crop Growth and Plant Parameters\nElement Working Group is responsible for\nassessing the amount of carbon that is stored\nand emitted in Kenya’s crops and plants as\nthey grow. To do this, the team will undertake\ndetailed assessment of the main crops in\nKenya and will develop models that can track\ncarbon emissions from crops during the\ngrowth process.\n\nMeasuring the emissions from a particular\ncrop is not easy – all leaves, stems and\nbranches need to be measured, and carbon\nneeds to be followed into the soils, deadwood\nand the atmosphere. This work requires the\nscientists involved in SLEEK to set-up a range\nof experimental sites, where they can track\nthe growth of Kenya’s most important plants\nin fine, scientific detail.\n\nThe team is also responsible for identifying\nthe management practices that are used in\nKenya. This is because the level of carbon\nstored by a particular crop can differ\nsignificantly based on the management of\nthat crop. For example, double cropping\nmaize with a second crop will produce a\nsignificantly different response compared\nwith planting maize alone.\n\nx Soil Carbon: This team is assessing the level of\ncarbon stored in Kenya’s soils and using\nmodels to track this change over time.\n\nThe Soil Carbon Element Working Group is\nresponsible for assessing the level of carbon\nstored in Kenya’s soils. Carbon is naturally\nstored in soils and is essential for any type of\ntree growth. As trees grow they draw on\nstores of carbon. Equally, when trees and\nplants die or drop leaves some of this carbon\nis reintroduced into the soil, while the rest\nemitted into the atmosphere.\n\nTo assess the carbon in Kenya’s soils, the Soil\nCarbon team will customize the RothC model\nfor Kenya. RothC is an international model\nthat is used around the world to track the\nflow of carbon dioxide and other gases within\nsoils.\n\nTo undertake this customization the Soil team\n\n91\n\nwill need to set up field trials across Kenya to\nunderstand the different soil types across the\ncountry. To do this, they will need to setup\nintensive field sites that can track changes in\ncarbon over time. They will also need to\nunderstand how soil carbon changes with\ndifferent land-uses.\n\nOnce the team has developed a robust\nunderstanding of different soil types and how\nthey change over time, the team will need to\ndevelop maps that show the distribution of\ndifferent soil types across Kenya\n\nx Forest Biomass and Growth: This team is\ndeveloping models to track how carbon is\nstored and released by trees as they grow.\n\nForests are one of the most important carbon\nsinks in Kenya. The Forest team will be\nresponsible for tracking the changes in\nKenya’s\nforest\ncover\nover\ntime,\nand\nunderstanding how the changes in Kenya’s\nforests effect emissions.\n\nThis is done by measuring the amount of\ncarbon stored in trees as they grow. To do\nthis, scientists must measure the entire tree\nas it grows to understand how much carbon is\nstored in the parts of tree such as the\nbranches, trunk and leaves. This scientific\nprocess must be undertaken for each of the\nkey Kenyan species and models must be\ndeveloped to be able to simulate the process.\n\nThe team also must assess the carbon in the\ndead wood and litter that is shed by the main\nKenyan species.\n\nHaving understood the amount of carbon\ntypically stored in Kenyan species, the team\nwill be responsible for understanding the\ndifferent ways that Kenyan forests are\nmanaged. This will allow the team to use the\nforest models to estimate carbon flows across\nKenya’s forests.\n\nx Land Use Change and Management: This\nteam is responsible for understanding the\ndrivers of change in Kenya’s land sector,\nwhich will help explain change in the future.\n\nThis team will examine the key drivers of\nchange in Kenya’s land-sector. They will look\nat the factors that typically lead to changes\nfrom one use to another. For example, this\nteam will look at the factors which lead to\nconversion of forests to agriculture, such as\nbuilding new roads or the expansions of new\nforests communities.\n\nThis understanding will allow the team to\nunderstand how policy decisions will affect\nKenya’s land-sector. This will provide policymakers and communities with a far more\ndetailed assessment of the implications of\nland-policy decisions.\n\nx Modelling: The modelling team is working to\ncombine the information and data collected\nthrough SLEEK to produce a unified, accurate\nreport of Kenya’s emissions form the landsector.\n\nThe Modelling team is responsible for\ncombining all the data collected through\nSLEEK and using it to estimate Kenya’s\nemissions.\n\nTo do this, the team is working with experts\nto develop and apply cutting-edge tools that\nwill be able to track changes in Kenya’s\nemissions from year to year by combining the\ndata-sets in a way that simulates natural\nprocesses using Kenyan specific data.\n\nx Land Cover Change: This team is responsible\nfor using remote sensing imagery to develop\nmaps that will show the changes in land-cover\nover time.\n\nThe Land Cover Change Element Working\n\n92\n\nGroups is responsible for using remote\nsensing and other satellite imagery to map\nKenya’s lands. These maps will provide as\nmuch information as possible on the land\ncover. For example, the maps will show\nwhether the land is covered by forest,\nbuildings or a particular crop.\n\nUsing historical satellite imagery, this team\nwill then be able to compare maps over time,\nshowing how the land cover has changed in\nKenya. This information will be provided to\nthe modelling team, who will be able to use\nthe maps to estimate how Kenya’s carbon\nemissions have changes as a result of changes\nin land cover.\n\nx Crop Selection App: SLEEK will provide\nweather data & crop data to help farmers\nmake better decisions about how to use their\nland.\n\nx Forest App: This app can use SLEEK weather,\nland-use and forest data to help identify sites\nwhere reforestation is most likely to be\nsuccessful.\nSTATE OF THE ART GIS LAB SET UP AT DRSRS\n\nThe Department of Resource Survey and\nRemote Sensing (DRSRS) has been part of the\nSLEEK program leading the component of data\nprovisioning in the area of Land cover and land\ncover change across the country. Clinton\nFoundation has invested in a state of the art GIS\nlab in the institution to build the country’s\ncapacity to map and track land cover change\nand provide the data during the program and\nfor the long term. The lab has been equipped\nwith 14 desktops and 5 laptops, a server and\nthe latest versions of Geographic Information\nSystem (GIS) and Remote Sensing software that\nwill be used to produce credible land cover\nmaps for monitoring land use changes over\ntime to improve decision making in land use\nmanagement.\n\nRepresentatives from Survey of Kenya, Kenya\nForest Service, DRSRS and Regional Centre for\nMapping of Resources for Development have\nalready started working in the lab and started\nthe land cover mapping work for the country.\nThe lab will continue to produce these maps for\nsustainable flow of data into the SLEEK data\nplatform beyond the program timelines. Over\nthe past 3 weeks, the team has been carrying\nout data preparation and testing of various land\ncover mapping methods to identify the most\nsuitable method that is applicable for Kenya.\n This will set a benchmark of standards for\nsustainability.\n\nProgram Structure\n\n93\n\nSource: MoEWNR; http://www.sleek.environment.go.ke/program-structure/\n\nThe Program Steering Committee develops\npolicy, coordinates inter-ministerial support,\nand approves all workplans and budgets.

This\nimprovement has facilitated a much deeper\nanalysis and understanding of the impacts due\nto climate change on the various sectors.\n\nRecognising that the risks posed by climate\nchange are legitimate but highly unpredictable,\nthe Government of Kenya published in 2010 its\nNCCRS, which investigated climate vulnerability.\nThe NCCAP)116 process included a climate riskbased adaptation analysis through an extensive\nconsultative process which was built on the\nfindings of the NCCRS, with the aim to:\nx Provide evidence of the key climate risks to\nKenya\nx Assess climate change impacts on the sectors\nx Document climate adaptation activities that\nare underway, planned and recommended\nx Develop a set of potential and priority\nadaptation actions to address projected\nclimate impacts per sector that will feed into\nKenya’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP)\nx Support the integration of climate change\nadaptation into relevant new and existing\nsector policies, development, budgetary and\nplanning processes and strategies, and across\ndifferent levels.\n\nThe adaptation analysis conducted during the\nNCCAP is summarised in the Adaptation\nTechnical Analysis Report (ATAR) and detailed\nin a series of reports compiled in the Adaptation\nAnnex to the NCCAP.\n\nA comprehensive National Adaptation Plan\n(NAP) to accompany the NCCAP is at an\nadvanced stage of development. Evidence and\nrecommendations of the ATAR have been\ndrawn on to set adaptation priorities and to\nframe an adaptation strategy that responds to\nKenya’s\ndevelopment\nneeds\nand\nclimate\nvulnerability by proposing initiatives to build\nadaptive capacity and resilience through social\nsectors. A framework is being developed for the\ngovernance of climate adaptation decisionmaking and implementation from local to\nnational levels. The draft NAP addresses the\nintegration of climate change adaptation into\nrelevant new and existing policies, programmes\nand activities; and incorporating adaptation\nplanning in the annual and medium-term\n\n100\n\nplanning processes and strategies, within all\nrelevant sectors and at different levels of\ngovernment.\n\nThis chapter on Assessment of Vulnerabilities\nand Adaptation to Climate Change in Kenya\nassesses past climate trends and briefly\nsummarises\nthe\npossible\nfuture\nclimate\nscenarios in the country, the risks and\nvulnerabilities associated with the trends.\nAdaptation actions are then proposed. The\nchapter draws on existing assessments and\nresearch through desk research, supplemented\nwith expert interviews. The chapter draws\nextensively from prior work including the\nNCCRS, NCCAP, ATAR and Draft NAP, and\nincludes updated research.\n\nBASELINE CLIMATIC, ENVIRONMENTAL AND\nSOCI-ECONOMIC SCENARIO\n\nKenya’s baseline climatic, environmental and\nsocio-economic scenarios have been described\nin detail in Chapter 1 of this Second National\nCommunications report.\n\nThe country is situated between 5oN 5oS and\nlongitudes 34oE and 42oE with varied landforms\ntypes\nwhich\nare\ndivided\ninto\nplains,\nescarpments, hills with low and high mountains\nand breaks. What would otherwise be a largely\ntropical climate is moderated by a diverse\ntopography and the influence of the Indian\nOcean and Lake Victoria. This means that Kenya\nexperiences significant geographical climate\nvariations. The Indian Ocean runs along the\ncountry’s south-eastern border, bringing a\ncomparatively wet climate to the narrow\ncoastal zone. This gives way to large areas of\nlow lying semi-arid land that stretch north and\nwest, before rising sharply to the temperate\nhighland plateau, one of Africa’s most fertile\nregions. The plateau is bisected by the East\nAfrica Rift Valley, which separates Lake Victoria\nin the west and the mountainous regions of the\ncentral and northern highlands that include the\nnation’s highest peak of Mount Kenya (at 5,200\nm).\n\nDroughts\nand\nfloods,\noften\nregionally\nconcentrated, occur relatively frequently (on\naverage every three to four years), and are\nlinked to El Niño or La Niña episodes.117 An\nimportant pattern of ocean-influenced climate\nvariability comes from the Indian Ocean Dipole\n(IOD), which can accentuate the effects of El\nNiño episodes and lead to extreme weather in\nthe region. More generally, climate variability of\nboth rainfall and temperature significantly\nimpacts Kenya’s economy. For example, it has\nbeen estimated that flooding costs the country\nin the region of 5.5 per cent of GDP every seven\nyears and drought costs approximately 8 per\ncent of GDP every five years. In total these\nclimatic events cost the country around 2.4 per\ncent of GDP per year.118\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS\n\nPresent Climate Change (Trends and\nbaseline)\n\nObserved Temperature Trends\nTemperatures in Kenya vary dramatically from\nregion to region, with high altitude regions\nexperiencing substantially cooler temperatures\nthan the coastal and lowland zones. Nairobi sits\nin the central highlands at an elevation of\n1,800m and has a mean annual temperature of\n18°C, whereas Mombasa, in the coastal\nlowlands,\nexperiences\nmean\nannual\ntemperatures of 26°C.119 Kenya’s equatorial\nlocation means that there is little temporal\nvariation in temperature, with the coolest\nmonths (June to August) typically being 2°C\ncooler than the warmest.\n\nObserved climate data for Kenya shows a\ndistinct warming trend since the 1960s.120 From\nthe early 1960s, Kenya has experienced\ngenerally increasing temperature trends over\nvast areas. Over the inland areas, the trends in\nboth minimum (night/early morning) and\n\n101\n\nmaximum (daytime) temperatures depict a\ngeneral warming (increasing) trend with time.\nHowever, the increase in the minimum\ntemperatures is steeper than in maximum\ntemperatures. The result of the steeper\nincrease in Tmin and a less steep increase Tmax\nis a reduction in the diurnal temperature range\n(difference\nbetween\nthe\nmaximum\nand\nminimum temperatures) – Figures 33-38 depict\nthese trends for some selected representative\nlocations in the country.\n\nFigure 33: Temperature Trends for Nairobi (Central Kenya).

Annual minimum Temperature.\n\n104\n\nThe minimum temperature depicts a steady increase over the years\nSource: Data and figure from KMD, 2012)\n\nTemperature trends in Kenya since 1960 have\nthe following characteristics:121\n\nx Mean annual temperature has increased by\napproximately 1°C at an average rate of\n0.21°C per decade.\nx The increase in temperature has been most\nrapid in the months from March to May\n(0.29°C per decade) and slowest in June to\nSeptember (0.19°C per decade).\nx The average number of hot days per year\n(defined as daily temperature that is in the\ntop 10% of daytime temperatures for that\nregion and season) has increased by 57 (a\n15.6% increase) between 1960 and 2003. The\nrate of increase is highest in March to May\nwith the average number of hot days\nincreasing by 5.8 days per month.\nx The average number of hot nights per year\n(defined as night-time temperature that is in\nthe top 10% of night-time temperatures for\nthat region and season) increased by 113 (a\n31% increase) between 1960 and 2003. The\nrate of increase is highest from September to\nNovember with the average number of hot\nnights increasing by 12 days per month.\nx The average number of cold days and nights\n(defined as temperatures in the lowest 10%\nfor that region and season) has decreased by\n4.4% and 11.4% respectively. The rate of\ndecrease of cold days is highest in September\nto November (5.7%) and the rate of decrease\nof cold nights is highest from December to\nFebruary (11.5%).\n\nObserved Precipitation Trends\n\nOn an annual basis, rainfall in Kenya is governed\nprimarily by the movement of the Inter-Tropical\nConvergence Zone (ITCZ), a belt of low pressure\nthat forms near the equator and migrates south\nthrough Kenya in October to December and\nreturns, moving northwards in March, April and\nMay. The ITCZ brings wet weather to the region\nand so Kenya experiences two distinct wet\nperiods:\n\nx The ‘long rains’ (March to May)\nx The ‘short rains’ (October to December).122\n\nThe ‘long rains’ bring more than 70% of Kenya’s\n\n105\n\ntotal rainfall with the ‘short rains’ contributing a\nfurther 20%.123 The remaining 6 months of the\nyear are typically dry, contributing just 10% of\nthe country’s total rainfall. There is also\nsignificant geographical variation, with the Arid\nand Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs) typically receiving\nless than 250mm compared with up to 2,000\nmm in the high mountain regions (Figures 39 A\nand B).\n\nAs is evident from Figure 39 A, Kenya’s rainfall\nalso varies over longer time periods.124 Annual\nvariation in rainfall is influenced by the\nrelationship between the ITCZ and the surface\ntemperatures of the Indian Ocean. Warmer\nthan average ocean surface temperatures – El\nNiño episodes – usually result in above average\nrainfall in the short rainfall season, whereas\ncolder than average surface temperatures – La\nNiña episodes – bring drier than average\nweather.125 As the ‘short rains’ are most\naffected by the presence of El Niño or La Niña\nconditions, they account for the majority of the\ninter-annual rainfall variability (74%).126\n\nAlthough there is little evidence of an overall\nchange in precipitation, there is a significant\ngeographical diversity in observed rainfall\ntrends. Observed climate trends show mixed\ntrends with some areas having increasing and\nothers decreasing rainfall all over the country\non an annual basis. Whilst considerable\nuncertainty\nremains\nover\nthe\nstatistical\nsignificance of rainfall trends in Kenya, some\nstudies have suggested that the rainfall during\nthe ‘short rains’ can be isolated from the total\nrainfall.127 This would explain the trend for\nnorthern wetting and southern drying.\n\nEven though some studies suggest a generally\nmixed rainfall trends in the country, rainfall\npatterns are highly localised. Rainfall variations\nover Mombasa on Kenya’s coast and Lodwar in\nthe North West of the country demonstrate the\nlocalised nature of rainfall trends over the last\n50 years. (Figures 40 [A, B, and C] and Figure 41\n[A, B and C])\n\n106\n\nFigure 39: Distribution of mean annual rainfall and rainfall variation in Kenya. A: Distribution of mean annual\nrainfall.

They show a\ngenerally increasing trend in the proportion\nof heavy rainfall events (defined as daily\nrainfall total that is in the top 5% of rainfall\nevents for that region and season).\nx\nTrends for 1-day rainfall maxima and 5-day\nrainfall maxima also show inconsistent\ntrends.\nx\nRainfall patterns in the country are highly\nlocalised.\nx\nPeriodic droughts occur in Kenya relatively\nfrequently. Moderate drought events have\nbeen recorded on average every 3-4 years\nand major droughts affect the country\nevery 10 on average. Prolonged droughts\nhave become more common since 2000,\nincreasing the amount of arid and semi-arid\nland area to 80% of the total surface area.11\n\n________________________\n\nFuture Climate Change (Climate Change\nScenarios)\n\nFor Kenya, Regional Climate Models (RCMs)\nthat give greater spatial resolution for Kenya\nhave also been developed.129 130\n\nFuture Temperature Trends\n\nGeneral Circulation Models (GCM)131 data\nindicates that the following trends are\nconsidered likely for temperatures in Kenya.\n132\nStatistics quoted are for medium emissions\nscenario, relative to the baseline period 19611990, unless otherwise stated (see NCCAP and\nATAR for more details):\n\nx Mean annual temperature is projected to\nincrease by between 0.8 and 1.5°C by the\n2030s and 1.6°C to 2.7°C by the 2060s.\nx An increase is projected in the frequency of\n\nx hot days and hot nights. Projections indicate\nthat hot days could occur on 19-45% of days\nby the 2060s and 26-69% of days by the\n2090s. Hot nights are projected to increase\nmore quickly, occurring on 45-75% of nights\nby mid-century and 64-93% of nights by the\nend of the century.\nx Projections suggest a decrease in the number\nof days and nights that are considered ‘cold’\nin the current climate. Cold days and nights\nare expected to become very rare. GCM\nprojections suggest that there will be no cold\ndays or nights by the 2090s.\n\nFigure 42 provides a visualization of the trend\nthat GCMs have suggested for increased\ntemperatures for Kenya.133 Here the size of\nthe pixels indicates the degree of agreement\nover the magnitude of the increase. There is\ngood model agreement of temperature\nincreases of up to 3°C by 2100.\n\n111\n\nFigure 42: Temperature change for Africa by 2100 (from the 1960-1990 baseline) averaged over 21 CMIP3\nmodels\n\nSource: Met Office. (2011). Climate: Observations, projections and impacts. Kenya. Exeter, UK:\nMet Office.\n\nUsing the RCMs, the following temperature\ntrends in Kenya have been projected (See\nFigure 43):134\n\nx The whole of the country could warm by\nbetween 1°C and 5°C (by 2071-2100).\nx The dry seasons (March to May and October\nto December) will experience the greatest\nincrease in temperature, particularly in the\nnorth of the country.\nx The ‘long rains’ from March to May will\n\nexhibit the smallest increase, particularly in\nthe northeast of the country, where negligible\nchanges are projected in comparison to the\nbaseline period.\nx The northwest of the country will be warmer\nby around 1°C more than the rest of the\ncountry.\nx North eastern regions, in particular around\nWajir, will experience relatively less warming\nthan the rest of the country, by approximately\n1 -2°C.\n\n112\n\nFigure 43: RCM (RegCM3) temperature projection results for 2071-2100 (A2 emission scenario; 20km resolution).\n\nSource: GoK; National Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (ATAR)\n\n113\n\nFuture Precipitation Trends\n\nGCM data indicates that the following trends\nmay be seen for rainfall in Kenya.135 The\nfollowing statistics are for an A1B (medium)\nemissions scenario unless otherwise stated\n(see the NCCAP and ATAR for more details).\n\nx GCMs suggest that there may be increases in\naverage annual rainfall in Kenya by the\n2060s. However there is considerable model\ndisagreement with a range of projections\nvarying from a 5% decrease to a 17% increase\nby the 2030s and no change to a 26%\nincrease by 2060s.\nx The increase in total rainfall is projected to\nbe largest from October to December (-6 mm\nto +29 mm per month by 2030s and 0 mm to\n30 mm by the 2060s) and proportional\nchanges largest in January and February (-14\n% to +50 % by 2030s and -6 % to +60 % by\nthe 2060s). Again, the broad span of\nprojections indicates high levels of model\ndisagreement.\nx The GCMs suggest with greater confidence\n(on the basis of good model agreement) that\nthe proportion of annual rainfall that occurs\nin heavy events will increase. The range of\nincrease varies from 2 to 11% by the 2060s\nand 2 to 12% by the end of the century.\nx There\nis\nalso\nrelatively\ngood\nmodel\nagreement that 1 and 5-day rainfall annual\nmaxima will increase. The range of predicted\nincrease for 5-day events is between 2 to\n19mm by the 2060s and 2mm to 24mm by\nthe end of the century.\nx Figure 44 provides a visualisation of the trend\nthat GCMs have suggested for increased\nprecipitation for Kenya. Here the size of the\npixels indicates the degree of agreement\nover the magnitude of the increase. It shows\nthat\nthere\nis relatively\nstrong model\nagreement that precipitation will increase\nover Kenya.\n\nFigure 44: Percentage change in precipitation for Africa by 2100 (from 1960-1990 baseline) averaged over 21\nCMIP3 models.

Exeter, UK: Met Office.\n\n114\n\nThrough RCMs, the following precipitation\ntrends are projected in Kenya by the 2090s:\n\nx During\nthe\n‘long\nrains’,\nKenya\ncould\nexperience a significant increase in rainfall\nwith the largest increase occurring over the\nhighland districts and the coastal region\n(Figure 45 top right).\nx During the ‘short rains’ an increase in rainfall\ncould predominantly affect the region to the\nwest of the Rift Valley. The rest of the country\ncould experience slightly decreased rainfall in\nisolated pockets (Figure 45 bottom right). This\nis in contrast to the GCM average results,\nwhich suggest wetter conditions during the\n‘short rains’.136\nx The northeast of the country is projected by\nthe RCM to become significantly drier on an\nannual basis.

The number of rainfall\n\nmonitoring stations in Kenya has decreased\nfrom 2,000 in 1977, 1,497 in 1990 and 700 in\n2012. Today, Kenya has 62 temperature\nstations and 27 synoptic climate stations\nmeasuring a range of climate variables.138\n\nKey knowledge gaps for climate information\ninclude139:\n\nx Understanding\nrainfall\nseasonality\nand\ngeographical variations by increasing the\nnumber of rainfall monitoring stations to\nimprove regional modelling.\nx The role of ocean patterns on the regional\nclimate is not well understood. Improved\nunderstanding of the relationship between\nthe ENSO (El-Niño Southern Oscillation) and\nIOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) and precipitation\nevents would be advantageous.\nx Further\nresearch\non\nthe\ninfluence\nof\ntopography and of Lake Victoria on local\nclimate patterns is needed.\nx Some of the climate data that has been\ncollected\nis\nyet\nto\nbe\ndigitised\nand\ninformation exchange is limited by poor\ncommunications in some parts of the country.\n\nUncertainty about future climatic conditions\nwill persist, unless there is continued\ninvestment\nin\nseasonal\nforecasts\nand\ndownscaled\nclimate\nprojections.140\nThe\ncommon\napproach\nof\nrepresenting\nuncertainty is to examine output from\ndifferent climate models risks. However, this\nmay result in a gross over-estimation of our\ncurrent ability to predict sectoral responses to\nclimate change, for example in agriculture.141\nAlthough more exhaustive characterisation of\nuncertainty may be scientifically tractable,\nthe prospect of reducing uncertainty\ndepends on further progress being made\nin the underpinning climate science.142, 143\n\nA number of specific actions have been\nidentified and these can be found in\nTable 4 9 .\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND\nVULNERABILITY\nThe increasing variability in climate and the\nprojected incremental changes in air and sea\ntemperatures, precipitation and sea level,\ntogether with changes in the frequency and\nseverity of extreme events will have significant\nimplications\nfor\nsocial,\neconomic\nand\nenvironmental systems. The cumulative impacts\nof climate change over the next two to three\ndecades have the potential to reverse much of\nthe progress made towards the attainment of\nVision 2030. The costs of climate change could\nbe equivalent to 2.6 per cent of Kenya’s GDP\neach year by 2030.\nDroughts\nand\nfloods\nin\nparticular\nhave\ndevastating consequences on the environment,\nsociety and the wider economy. The associated\nspillover to the macro-economy has been\nsignificant. The overall impact of the 2008-2011\ndrought in Kenya is estimated at KSh 968.6\nbillion (USD 12.1 billion), and was predicted to\nhave caused a slowing down in the growth of\nthe country’s economy by an average of 2.8 per\ncent per year during that period. Similarly, the\n1998-2000 drought is estimated to have\nresulted in a 16 per cent reduction in the GDP in\neach of the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 financial\nyears.144 Lost industrial production alone due to\ninadequate power supply during this period\namounted to a loss of approximately KSh 110\nbillion (USD 1.4 billion).145\nFloods have also caused equally devastating\nconsequences in recent years, including loss of\nlives and livelihoods, personal property damage\nand\ndamage\nto\ninfrastructure,\nwith\n\n117\n\nramifications for the economy. For example, the\n1997-98 El Niño floods are estimated to have\ncaused damage equivalent to at least 11 per\ncent of GDP, including KSh 62 billion (USD 777\nmillion) in damage to transport infrastructure\nand KSh3.6 billion (USD 45 million) to water\nsupply infrastructure.\nWhile floods are generally associated with\nhigher damages on public infrastructure assets,\nthe burden of droughts falls more heavily on\npeople, communities and the private sector. In\nparticular, the livestock and agriculture sectors\nwere the most affected by the 2008 and 2011\ndrought events, with respective drops in\nproductivity of 72 per cent and 13 per cent.146\nAlong with these direct impacts, climate-related\nevents affect the overall performance of the\neconomy in the long run. Other macroeconomic trends which have been evident\nduring droughts and which appear to be\nexacerbated by climate related effects include:\n\nx Reduced\nforeign\nexchange\nearnings\n(Kenyan\nbusiness\nand\ninternational\ncompetitiveness)\nx Altered balance of payments (e.g. reduced\nexports, increased imports)\nx Current account deficit (e.g. reduced\ngovernment\nrevenues\nor\nincreased\nexpenses)\nx Price inflation (e.g. increased food or\nenergy prices).\n\nAs detailed in the NCCAP (2013-2017), the\nimpacts and risks identified below are based on\ndesk-based review, utilising peer-review and\ngrey literature, together with Kenya’s First\nNational Communication to the UNFCCC,\nstakeholder\nand\ncounty\nconsultations,\nTechnology Needs Assessment reports and\nother relevant national planning documents. By\nincorporating an assessment of their future\nlikelihood and consequence (the two key\nelements of risk), the assessment prioritised\nand ranked impacts with reference to the\nthemes of the Medium Term Plan. The strength\nof this methodology is that it puts climate\neffects at the centre of the analysis and derives\npriorities to address the most important risks –\noften assessed in terms of expected economic\nlosses where there is adequate information.\n\nRecent UNFCCC decisions have recommended\nnational adaptation planning be based on\nassessments of development needs and climate\nvulnerability. This approach recognises that\nadaptation actions need to address socioeconomic development deficits as well as\nclimate effects. The strength of this approach is\nthat\na\nfuller\nintegration\nwith\nnational\ndevelopment planning and implementation is\npossible than through the climate risks-based\napproaches. In the Draft National Adaptation\nPlan (NAP), the climate risk-based approach of\nthe ATAR and development needs and climate\nvulnerability have been combined to draw the\nstrengths from each. For this reason, this report\nhas heavily borrowed from the work already\ndone in the Draft NAP. Underpinning the Draft\nNAP is a Risk Assessment Report (TR1), which\nbuilds on the review of impacts undertaken for\nthe National Climate Change Response Strategy\n(NCCRS)147,\nand\nprovides\na\nmore\ncomprehensive and systematic assessment of\nhow climate change may exacerbate existing\nvulnerabilities.\n\nThe climate change impacts and risks to Kenya’s\neconomy have been analysed in detail for each\nsector in the Adaptation Technical Analysis\nReports (ATAR). Impacts for particular sectors\nhave been analysed as follows:\n\nWater Resources\n\nFreshwater\nresources\nare\nalready\nhighly\ninfluenced by inter-and intra-annual rainfall\nvariability, including the extremes of flooding\nand drought and climate change may further\nreduce the availability of this resource through\n\n118\n\naltered rainfall patterns, higher evaporation,\nlower lake levels, accelerated loss of glaciers\nand rising sea level. Water availability is already\na significant problem in cities. For example,\nMombasa receives only half of the water\nrequired to meet its needs, which leads to\nrationing and use of private sources.148\nIncreased temperatures and rainfall variability\nare likely to exacerbate the conditions already\nexperienced and may in the future have a\nsignificant impact on water availability.\n\nIn coastal locations, sea level rise is likely to\nrender more acute the current water supply\nand salinisation problem, as freshwater aquifers\nare contaminated with saline water.\n\nAgriculture, livestock and fishing (food\nsecurity)\n\nClimate change has the potential to significantly\naffect\nagriculture-based\nlivelihoods\nby\nchallenging the sustainability of current arable,\npastoral and fishing practices. Agriculture is\nextremely vulnerable to climate change, due to\nthe natural connections and dependencies that\nexist between climatic conditions and plant\ndevelopment. There are a variety of climate\ndrivers that are likely to directly and indirectly\nimpact agricultural productivity, as outlined\nbelow:\n\nx Higher temperatures are likely to directly\nreduce yields of desirable crops in the longterm. For example, parts of south west Kenya\nhave\nbeen\nhighlighted\nas\npotentially\nexperiencing a flip in the number of reliable\ncrop growing days from more than 90 to less\nthan 90 by the 2050s.149 This will clearly have\nimplications\nfor\nrural\nlivelihoods\nand\n“cropping might become too risky to pursue\nas a major livelihood strategy”.\nx Changes in precipitation patterns are likely to\ndirectly increase the likelihood of short-term\ncrop failures and long-term production\ndeclines. Rain-fed agriculture is and will\nremain the dominant source of staple food\nproduction and the livelihood foundation of\nthe majority of the rural poor in Kenya.150 The\nhigh\ninter-annual\nunpredictability\nin\nprecipitation is already having devastating\nconsequences on rural livelihoods in Kenya,\nwith\ndroughts\nand\nfloods\na\nfrequent\noccurrence in both the arid and semi-arid\nlands (ASALs) and the high potential areas.\nx A number of indirect impacts, such as\nincreased rates of runoff and soil erosion, and\nincreased\ncrop\nlosses\nfrom\nwildlife\nmigrations, insects, diseases and weeds, could\nsignificantly magnify production losses.\n\nDue to the fact that the majority of farmers are\nsmall-scale and subsistence, depending on the\n20% of Kenya’s land that is suitable for\nproducing crops for their own needs, the\nultimate end-point consequences resulting from\na decline in agricultural production are\ndetrimental impacts for food security and\nhuman health.\n\nWith respect to the longer-term implications of\na changing climate on agricultural productivity,\nfor Kenya there will be distinct “winners and\nlosers”, as climate change inevitably favours\nsome crops and regions over others. Equally,\nsome regions, namely the mixed rain-fed\ntemperate and tropical highlands, are projected\nto experience an increase in crop yield, whereas\nothers, namely the ASALs, are projected to\nwitness a significant decline in crop yields and\nlivestock numbers, as water resources become\nincreasingly scarce. These patterns are largely\ndriven\nby\nregional\nvariability\nin\nfuture\nprecipitation and geographic exposure to\nextreme events, particularly drought frequency.\nFor instance, for large parts of the ASALs and\nlowlands, where maize cropping is possible,\nmaize yields are projected to decline by 20 per\ncent by the 2050s.151 These losses are in the\nrange of 200-700 kg/ha, although in some grid\nsquares in the analysis, losses are larger than\nthis.152\nHowever, maize yields are projected to increase\n\n119\n\nin some of the highland areas of the East\nAfrican region, including the central and\nwestern highlands of Kenya, and the Great\nLakes Region by the 2050s. These increases in\nyield equate to between 200-700 kg/ha.153 In a\n\nfurther study,154 maize yield in the mixed rainfed temperate / tropical highland were\nprojected to increase by 33.3% by 2030s and\n46.5% by the 2050s. The possible trends for\nmaize are particularly encouraging, considering\nthe nation’s dependence on this crop and the\nhigh source of calories per capita per day this\ncrop contributes (36%).155\n\nFor the livestock sector, implications of climate\nchange on livestock-based rural livelihoods are\npredicted to be largely negative, with farmers\nexpected to incur heavy losses in the future.\nGrazing and mixed rain-fed livestock systems\nare highly vulnerable to climate, due to their\nheavy dependence on natural resources. A\nchanging climate is likely to have a number of\ndirect and indirect impacts on livestock\nproduction, as outlined below:\n\nx Higher temperatures and reduced water\navailability directly cause heat stress in\nlivestock,\nwhich\naffects\nphysiological\nprocesses, health and mortality. For example,\nheat stress for cattle causes a decrease in\nfood intake and an increase in respiratory\nrate, which affects milk yields.156 In a warmer\nclimate, excessively high temperatures are\npredicted to damage livestock production\n(through losses of herds to drought, which\nfrequently occurs currently in ASALs), as\nfarmers are forced to reduce their stock levels\nor risk losing them altogether.157\nx Livestock systems are directly impacted by\nnatural disasters, specifically flooding. For\nexample, during the El Niño flood of 1997/98,\nlarge numbers of livestock died from\ndrowning in the floodwaters, with several\nregions experiencing losses of over 90%.158\nx Climate\nchange\nmay\nindirectly\ncause\nincreased disease pressure on livestock,\nthrough direct effects on pathogens, hosts,\nvectors and epidemiology, together with a\nnumber of indirect effects, including changes\nin ecosystems and the abundance and/or\ndistribution of the competitors, predators and\nparasites of vectors.159\nx Climate-induced changes in crop resources\nwill have knock-on negative and positive\nconsequences for livestock systems, through\nthe allocation of feedstuffs, such as pasture,\nforage and grain. Changes in the quantity and\nquality of feed will encourage farmers to\neither decrease or increase their stocks.160\n\nPastoralism is the dominant form of livestock\nkeeping in Kenya. Approximately 60% of the\ncountry’s livestock is found in the ASALs, which\nconstitute about 80% of the country’s land mass\nand home of approximately 10% of the\ncountry’s population161. Extreme weather and\nclimate events already greatly impact the\nlivelihoods of pastoralists in Kenya, as the ASALs\nare\nlargely\ncharacterised\nby\nhigh\nevapotranspiration rates, low organic matter\nand poor infrastructure.162 Greater drought\nfrequency, in particular, may inhibit crop and\nanimal system recovery, resulting in long-term\ndegradation of grazing resources, continual\nreduction in herd size, and destabilisation of the\nsocial and economic standing of resource-poor\nlivestock keepers.20163\nAn increased drought frequency to more than\none drought every five years could cause\nsignificant, irreversible decreases in livestock\nnumbers in ASALs.164 Results indicate that a\ndrought\nonce\nevery\nfive\nyears\n(i.e.\nrepresentative of current conditions) keeps\nherd sizes stable in ASALs.165 Increased\nprobability of drought to once every three years\nhas the potential to decrease herd sizes, due to\nincreased mortality and poorer reproductive\nperformance of the animals.166 Recent droughtassociated food insecurity has been highest\namong the pastoralists and small-scale mixed\nfarmers found within these regions.167\n\nFor the fisheries sector, climate change-induced\n\n120\n\ndegradation of both freshwater and marine\nenvironments is likely to have significant\nimplications for associated biodiversity and\nfisheries. Increasing water temperatures and\ndecreasing water levels are likely to negatively\nimpact\nfish\nstocks,\nwith\ndetrimental\nconsequences for the rural communities such\nsystems support. With respect to marine fishing\nactivities, direct effects of climate change on\nmarine capture fisheries include sea level rise,\nsea temperature change, lower ocean pH levels,\nand changes in rainfall that will affect estuarine\nfisheries,\nchanges\nin\nocean\ncirculation,\nincreased storm frequency and intensity. These\ndirect effects will in turn alter fish habitats and\nchange the distribution and composition of\nspecies, which will have a profound impact on\nmarine ecosystems and fisheries.\n\nIn recent times, the fisheries sector has\nexperienced the detrimental consequences of\nclimate variability, specifically droughts. The\n2008-2011 drought impacted Kenya’s fisheries\nsector in a variety of complex and interrelated\nways. Low inflows into the lakes and reservoirs\nas a result of prolonged drought condition\ncoupled with the high evaporative effects have\ncontributed to receding water levels (e.g. Lakes\nTurkana, Naivasha, and Baringo) and the drying\nup of ponds.168 The receding water in the Lakes\nreduced the breeding grounds and also the\nfishing grounds, and some of the streams\nfeeding the lakes dried altogether.169\n\nIn summary, these are the impacts of climate\nvariability and climate change on Agriculture,\nLivestock and Fishing sector:\n\nx Higher temperatures are likely to directly\nreduce yields of desirable crops in the long\nterm. For example, parts of south west\nKenya have been highlighted as potentially\nexperiencing a significant reduction in the\nnumber of reliable crop growing days by\nthe 2050s170.\nx Changes in precipitation patterns are likely\nto directly increase short-term crop\nfailures and long-term production declines\nfor rain-fed agriculture. The high interannual unpredictability in precipitation is\nalready having negative consequences on\nrural livelihoods.\nx A number of indirect impacts, such as\nincreased rates of runoff and soil erosion,\nand increased crop losses from wildlife\nmigrations, insects, diseases and weeds,\ncould significantly magnify production\nlosses.\nx Declines in agricultural production will be\ndetrimental for the food security and\nhuman health of small-scale subsistence\nfarmers and their local communities.\nx Approximately\n60\nper\ncent\nof\nthe\ncountry’s livestock is found in the ASALs,\nwhich constitute about 80 per cent of the\ncountry’s land mass and which are home\nof\n30\nper\ncent\nof\nthe\ncountry’s\npopulation171. Pastoralism is the dominant\nform of livestock-keeping in the ASALs and\ngiven the recourse to mobility to manage\nclimate\nvariability,\npastoralism\nis\ninherently\nadaptive.\nHowever,\nthe\nincreased frequency of extreme weather\nevents, multiply the impact of factors that\nconstrain pastoralists’ livelihoods. Climate\nchange introduces additional uncertainties\ninto existing vulnerabilities, particularly in\nthe ASALs.172\n\nDroughts, being the prime recurrent disaster in\nKenya have occurred in 1991/92, 1995/96,\n1998/2000, 2004/2005, and 2008-11. The cycle\nof drought is becoming shorter, more frequent\nand more intense. Each of these events has\ncaused\nsevere\ncrop\nlosses,\nfamine\nand\npopulation displacement in the country. The\nprolonged drought of 2008 - 2011 resulted in\ncrop production losses of Ksh 69 billion for food\ncrops and Ksh 52 billion for cash crops, with\nmaize, tea and coffee losses being the highest.\n\nThe livestock sector experienced the worst\n\n121\n\nimpacts, losing approximately Ksh 699 billion,\nwith Ksh 56 billion in damages due to costs\nfrom veterinary care, water, feeds and\nproduction decline and Ksh 643 billion in losses\ndue to animal deaths.173\n\nDuring the 2008-2011 drought, the fisheries\nsector experienced effects with estimated value\nof Ksh 4.2 billion, comprising Ksh 3.6 billion in\nlosses and Ksh 0.5 billion in damages.\n\nImpacts on coastal zones\n\nClimate change impacts, including increases in\nsea surface temperature, sea level rise and\ncoastal erosion, are likely to put additional\npressure on coastal ecosystems174, including\nislands, estuaries, beaches, coral reefs and\nmarine\nbiodiversity.\nSea\nlevel\nrise\nin\ncombination with extreme weather events is\nlikely to intensify flooding as the majority of the\ncoastland is low-lying. Coral reef ecosystems\nare particularly vulnerable to climate change\nimpacts, with associated consequences for the\nlivelihoods of millions of people depending on\nthose ecosystems for food, income and\nshoreline protection. In the Western Indian\nOcean region, corals are already experiencing\nsubstantial\nstress\nfrom\nincreasing\nwater\ntemperatures and ocean acidity, with several\nsignificant coral bleaching and mortality events\nin recent decades (e.g. 1998). Climate change is\nvery likely to lead to more of such events and\nlower the recovery rate of pre-bleaching coral\ncover,\nfollowing\nincreasing\nsea\nsurface\ntemperatures. Furthermore, marine biological\ninvasions are increasingly recognised as a threat\nto biodiversity. Invasive alien species and\nHarmful Algal Blooms (HABs) are a current and\nsignificant threat to the health of coastal\necosystems\nthat\nmay\nbe\nclimate-change\nrelated. A number of medium to large-scale\nHABs impacted the northern coasts of East\nAfrica between December 2001–February 2002)\nand led to extensive fish mortality in Kenya (e.g.\nsurgeon fish, snapper, triggerfish).175\n\nIn coastal locations, ports and transport\ninfrastructure is particularly exposed, together\nwith tourism assets and settlements situated\nclose to the coast.\n\nHuman health\n\nClimate change is expected to put at risk\nhuman health by exacerbating the magnitude\nand occurrence of existing impacts, such as\nheat stress, air pollution, asthma, vector-borne\ndiseases\n(such\nas\nmalaria,\ndengue,\nschistosomiasis\n–\nalso\nreferred\nto\nas\nswimmer’s itch or snail fever – and tick-borne\ndiseases),\nwater-borne\nand\nfood-borne\ndiseases\n(such\nas\ndiarrhoeal\ndiseases).\nAccording to the World Health Organisation,\nincreasing temperatures and precipitation\npatterns arising from a changing climate in the\npast 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives\nannually,176 among which 88% of the disease\nburden afflicts children under the age of 5. The\ncurrent burden of climate-sensitive disease is\nhigh in Kenya and future climate change is\nexpected to “exacerbate the occurrence and\nintensity of future disease outbreaks and may\nincrease the spread of diseases in some\nareas”.177 For Kenya, the potential implications\nof a changing climate on health are as follows:\n\nx Geographic exposure to malaria, which is\none of the most physically and economically\ndebilitating diseases in Kenya, is predicted to\nshift due to increasing temperatures and\nchanging\ndistribution\nof\nprecipitation.\nReports indicate that the Kenyan Highlands,\nwhich were initially free of malaria, will be\nexposed to the risk of malaria following\nincreasing temperatures and precipitation.178\n179 180 In contrast, exposure will likely be\nreduced in lower altitudes.181 A recent\nmodelling study has projected that by 2055,\nas a result of the central average climate\nwarming (2.3°C) across the projections, the\n\n122\n\npopulation annually affected by malaria in\nrural areas over 1,000 metres (which\ncomprises 63.5% of the population of Kenya)\nwould increase by up to 74%. However,\nthere is controversy over the spread of\nmalaria to the Highlands because most of\nthe studies fail to integrate non-climate\nfactors, such as the decline in the control\nand treatment of the disease.182\nx Increasing annual temperature is likely to be\nresponsible for increasing prevalence of\ndiarrheal\ndisease,\nparticularly\namong\nchildren\nunder\n5\nyears.\nFurthermore,\nextreme events, especially extreme rainfall,\nwill further threaten the health of the\nincreasing population without basic sanitary\ninfrastructure and reliable waste collection\ninfrastructures.\nx Extreme events and El Niño floods are also\nlikely to lead to increasing outbreaks of\nother diseases such as cholera and rift valley\nfever.\nFor\nexample,\nrift\nvalley\nfever\noutbreaks\nin\nEast\nAfrica\nare\nclosely\nassociated with the heavy rainfall that occurs\nduring the warm phase of the ENSO\nphenomenon.183\nx In coastal areas, toxins from HABs can create\nsignificant health risks for humans and wideranging impacts on marine ecosystems. The\nmost potent HABs produce neurotoxins that\nmay be responsible for human illness or\ndeath via consumption of contaminated\nseafood, particularly bivalve molluscs (e.g.\noysters, mussels), commonly referred to as\nshellfish poisoning. During recent years there\nhas been an apparent increase in the\noccurrence of HABs in many marine and\ncoastal regions184 and a number of cases are\nreported in Kenya. This may be due to\nincreased stratification of the upper water\ncolumn, changes in ocean circulation altering\nphytoplankton assemblages and increased\nfreshwater\nrun-off\nfrom\nland\nwith\nconsequent\nnutrient\nenrichment\n(eutrophication).\n\nForestry and wildlife\n\nAnticipated impacts of climate change on\nbiodiversity\ninclude\nshift\nof\necosystem\nboundaries, change in natural habitats and\nsharp increases in extinction rates for some\nspecies.\n\nDuring the 2008-2011 drought, drought and\nindirect\nimpacts\nfrom\nwildfires\nincluded\nenvironmental losses as a result of damages to\nplant and animal species, habitats, reduced\nforest\nproductivity,\nlower\nwater\nlevels,\nincreased livestock and wildlife mortality rates.\n\nKenya’s natural resources, in particular its rich\nflora and fauna, are among the country’s most\nvaluable\nnatural\nassets.\nThe\nnatural\nenvironment is exceptionally diverse and as a\nconsequence climate-related risks will vary\ndepending on the setting.\n\nDrought, in particular, already threatens\nKenya’s rich biodiversity and species loss has\nbeen observed, while in other places, the\nnumber of indigenous and important species\nhas dwindled significantly.185 Drought also\ncauses poorer habitat suitability in terms of\nfood, water, cover and useable space, leading\nto\nwildlife\nmigration,\nmortality\nthrough\nstarvation, predation, reduced production and\nrecruitment (survival of young ones) and\nbroader\nenvironmental\ndegradation.\nIn\naddition to these extreme events, the slow\ncreeping\nchange\nin\ntemperature\nand\nprecipitation patterns over the longer-term are\nlikely to negatively impact vegetation and\nwetlands, with associated consequences for\nbirds and animals higher up the food chain.\nThe distribution of forests in Kenya is largely\ndetermined by precipitation, which means\nclimate change has the potential to cause\nsignificant forest dieback and biodiversity loss.\nThis\nwould\nhave\nassociate\ndetrimental\nconsequence for rural livelihoods that are\n\n123\n\ndependent on forest goods and services.\nForest fires are an additional hazard that is\ninfluenced by climatic conditions. Since about\n1990, Kenya has lost an average of >5,700\nhectares of forested land per year due to\nforest\nfires.186\nThe\nprojected\nrise\nin\ntemperatures and long periods of drought are\npredicted to lead to more frequent and more\nintense fires. Forest fires have in the recent\npast affected Kenya’s major forests, including\nthe Mount Kenya forest fire in February/March\n2012.\n\nUrban and housing\n\nClimate change is likely to make rural livelihood\nstrategies and living conditions increasingly\nchallenging and as a result is likely to\nexaggerate the rural-to-urban migration trend\nKenya is currently experiencing. Specific risks\nand challenges for communities, especially\nthose living in urban environments and\nparticularly the most vulnerable, include river\nand flash flooding, with flood related fatalities\nconstituting 60 per cent of disaster victims in\nKenya. Extreme events and particularly El Niño\nrains are likely to undermine the health of\nKenya’s inhabitants directly through increasing\nnumbers of injuries and deaths and indirectly\nthrough\nwater\nquality\nissues\nand\nfood\ninsecurity. Drought and associated water\nscarcity, in particular, have the potential to\nexacerbate existing inequalities. Women in\nKenya\nhave\nbeen\nobserved\nto\nbe\ndisproportionately affected by drought because\npre-existing gender discrimination exposes\nthem to higher rates of poverty and insecurity\nand because of the extra socio-economic\nburden they have meeting the needs of\nhouseholds, children, the vulnerable and the\nelderly.\n\nArid and semi-arid lands\n\nThe influx of civil strife and drought-driven\nrefugees to northern Kenya creates challenges\nfor the ASAL economy and natural resource\nbase. According to UNHCR, Kenya hosted\n650,000 refugees located in three camps in\n2012. KFS reported that 11.3 million tonnes of\nfuelwood were cut by the refugees from an\narea of 80-km radius over three years. The\nrecovery of these resources will take a long\ntime in the pastoral areas.\n\nOver the past few decades, transformations in\nthe ASALs have impacted on the livelihoods of\nthe pastoralists. Migration of rural communities\nfrom the congested high-potential areas and\nthe dry arid areas to cities has contributed to\noverpopulated slums and settlements that lack\nbasic services. The dwellers of the slums in turn\ncontinue to migrate to the semi-arid areas and\npursue non-pastoral activities such as cropping\nin grazing lands not well suited for agriculture.\n\nThe 2008-2011 drought in Kenya had profound\nimpacts on many communities, destroying\nlivelihoods and increasing vulnerability. In\npastoralist areas where men are traditionally\nresponsible for livestock, reduced herd sizes\nforced men to migrate to urban centres for\nwage employment. This had implications for\nwomen and children due to the additional\nburden of sustaining household food, water and\nhuman security. School attendance rates\ndecreased, child labour increased and conflicts\nover resources were observed to intensify.\n\nTourism\n\nWith its close connections to the environment\nand climate itself, tourism is considered to be a\nhighly climate-sensitive industry.187 A wide\nrange\nof\nclimate-induced\nenvironmental\nchanges will have profound effects on tourism\nat the local and regional destination level.\n\nChanges in water availability, biodiversity loss\nand reduced landscape aesthetics, increased\nnatural\nhazards,\ncoastal\nerosion\nand\ninundation and the increasing incidence of\n\n124\n\nvector-borne diseases will all impact the\ntourism industry to varying degrees. However\nlimited research has been undertaken on the\nimpacts of climate change on tourism in Kenya.\n\nManufacturing, Transport and Trade\n\nClimate change has the potential to impact\nmanufacturing, retail and trade sectors across a\nrange of economic scales, from individual\nbusinesses\noperating\nin\nmanufacturing,\nwholesale and retail through to the national\neconomy and international trade. Impacts to\ncritical supporting infrastructure, such as\nenergy, water, communications and transport,\nhave the potential to reverberate into the\nprivate sector, with consequences for business\ncontinuity, revenue, workforce and associated\nsupply chains.\nClimate induced changes in productivity in the\ntea, coffee and vegetables subsectors have\nimplications for exports and imports. For\nexample, recent crop failure in maize resulted in\nthe importation of 2.6 million bags between\n2008 and 2009, worth Ksh 6.7 billion.188\n\nReduced output of hydropower that resulted\nfrom 2008-2011 drought reduced revenue for\nthe electricity utility, Kenya Power Company by\nKsh 2.6 billion. Likewise, the Kenyan electricity\nproducer KenGen also reported a downward\ntrend in their revenue in late 2010, totalling Ksh\n1.25 billion.189 Reduced hydropower production\nwas accompanied by an increased share of\nthermal power generation at a higher cost of\ngeneration. The losses due to higher production\ncosts are estimated to be about Ksh 29.8 billion\ncontributing to total cumulative losses of\napproximately Ksh 32.4 billion.\n\nClimate change is a potential “external\nshock” to the financial services sector for\nexample through exposure to indirect risks\nto\ninvestment\nportfolios,\nand\nretail\ncustomers defaulting on loans, and to\ninsurance through increased risks leading to\nhigh claim ratios and lower uptake of\ninsurance cover.\n\nInfrastructure (for energy and transport)\n\nA range of climate drivers have the potential\nto\ncompromise\ninfrastructure\ndesign,\nfunction and performance across a range of\nsettings. In coastal locations, ports and\ntransport\ninfrastructure\nis\nparticularly\nexposed, together with tourism assets and\nsettlements situated close to the coast.\nRiverine flooding and landslides have the\npotential to cause significant damage to\nphysical\ninfrastructure\nsuch\nas\nroads,\nbridges, water pipelines and power lines,\nresulting\nin\nwidespread\ndisruption,\na\nrequirement\nfor\nadditional\ncapital\nexpenditure\nand\nwider\nenvironmental\ndamage. Droughts cause underperformance\nof hydroelectric power infrastructure, with\npower generation in periods of drought\nreduced by almost 40 per cent of normal\nyears.190\n\nPRIORITY ADAPTATION OPTIONS\n\nThe development of the draft National\nAdaptation\nPlan\n(NAP)\nincluded\nthe\nidentification of criteria, which were used to\nselect priority actions under each Medium Term\nPlan theme. The criteria were weighted to\nensure\nactions\naddressing\nexisting\nvulnerabilities scored highly. Projected changes\nwere addressed through the selection of no and\nlow\nregrets\nmeasures,\nincorporation\nof\nknowledge of future climate change into\ndecisions on long-lived fixed assets and policies,\nand identifying where a long lead-in decision\ntimeline is required before an action can take\neffect. Adaptation priorities identified and\nelaborated in the NAP are listed below in Table\n\n48. These priorities are based on risk and\nvulnerability assessments across the MTP II\nsectors, and build on NCCAP priority actions in a\n\n125\n\nwide range of sectors. For details, reference is\nmade to the NCCAP and the ATAR.\n\n126\n\nTable 39: Adaptation priorities identified and elaborated in the NAP\nx MTP SECTOR\nx PRIORITY ADAPTATION ACTIONS\nx Energy\nx Increase the resilience of current and future energy systems*\nx Science, Technology and\ninnovations\nx Support innovation and development of appropriate technologies that\npromote climate resilient development*\nPublic sector reforms\nIntegrate climate change adaptation into the public sector reforms\nx Human\nResource\nDevelopment, Labour and\nEmployment\nx Enhance adaptive capacity and resilience of the informal private sector\nx Infrastructure\nx Climate proofing of infrastructure (energy, roads, buildings, ICT)*\nx Land Reforms\nx Mainstream climate change adaptation in land reforms*\nEducation and training\nEnhance awareness, education and training in climate change adaptation across\npublic and private sectors\nHealth\nStrengthen integration of climate change adaptation into the health sector*\nEnvironment\nEnhance climate information services\nEnhance the resilience of ecosystems to climate variability and change*\nWater and irrigation\nMainstream of climate change adaptation in the water sector by implementing the\nNational Water Master Plan (2014)*\nPopulation, urbanisation and\nhousing\nEnhance the adaptive capacity of the population, urbanisation and housing sector*\nGender, Vulnerable Groups and\nYouth\nStrengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerable groups (lactating women, children\nunder 5, elderly, sick, physically challenged) through social safety nets and insurance\nschemes\nTourism\nEnhance the resilience of the tourism value chain\nAgriculture, livestock\ndevelopment and fisheries\nEnhance the resilience of the agriculture, livestock and fisheries value chains by\npromoting climate smart agriculture and livestock development*\nPrivate Sector/ Trade;\nManufacturing; Business\nProcess Outsourcing, Financial\nservices\nCreate enabling environment for the resilience of private sector investment,\ndemonstrate an operational business case*\nOil and mineral resources\nIntegrate climate change adaptation into the extractive sector, including climate\nproofing of infrastructure*\nDevolution\nMainstream climate change adaptation into county integrated development plans\n* Denotes adaptation actions that have mitigation co-benefits.\n\nADAPTATION GOVERNANCE\n\nThe following organisations constitute part of\nthe governance framework for adaptation in\nKenya:\n\nx The Climate Change Secretariat, MENRRDA\nleads the work on adaptation, including the\ndevelopment of the NAP and implementation\nof the NCCAP.\nx NEMA is the National Designated Authority\nfor the CDM and the National Implementing\nEntity\nmanaging\nactivities\nunder\nthe\nAdaptation Fund.\nx The Vision 2030 Secretariat, Ministry of\n\n127\n\nPlanning and Devolution, is undertaking work\nto assess adaptation and mitigation in flagship\nprojects.\nx The Ministry of Planning and Devolution is\ndeveloping climate change indicators in its\nHandbook to measure progress under the\nMTP2.\nx County government are developing climate\nchange indicators to track progress under\ntheir County Integrated Development Plans.\nx The National Drought Management Authority\nundertakes activities on drought management\nand emergency preparedness that improve\nadaptive capacity.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nStockholm Environment Institute (SEI) (2009).\nThe Economics of Climate Change in Kenya.\nDFID, DANIDA.\nDowning, C., Preston, F., Parusheva, D.,\nHorrocks, L., Edberg, O., Samazzi, F.,\nWashington, R., Muteti, M., Watkiss, P. and\nNyangena,\nW.\n(2008).\nKenya:\nClimate\nScreening and Information Exchange.

Such measures may either reduce\nthe increase in greenhouse gas emissions\n(abatement) or increase terrestrial storage of\ncarbon (sequestration). All the measures have to\nbe in compliance with the applicable national and\ninternational agreements, policies and legislation.\n\nAlthough developing countries are not required to\ntake on emission reduction commitments, Kenya\nviews undertaking climate change mitigation and\nassessment\nas\na\nmeans\nto\nsustainable\ndevelopment. For the country, undertaking\nmitigation evaluation analysis also facilitates the\nimplementation\nof\nmitigation\nprojects,\nstrengthening of institutional and human capacitybuilding and the prioritisation and evaluation of\nsocial, economic and environmental programmes.\n\nThis\nchapter\npresents\nKenya’s\nmitigation\nevaluation analysis, describing the low-carbon\nassessment undertaken in the six mitigation\nsectors: energy, transport, industry, agriculture,\nforestry and waste management. The assessment\npresented in this report is based on the Mitigation\nchapter of the NCCAP, but with updated data and\ninformation. Detailed analysis of the development\nscenarios were carried out during the NCCAP\nprocess in 2012. Therefore, this report does not\nattempt to conduct assessment of the country’s\nlow carbon development pathway with new\ndevelopment scenarios. It however updates the\ndetailed assessment carried out during the NCCAP\n\nprocess by applying the latest available data and\ninformation, some of which were not available at\nthe time of developing the NCCAP.\n\nAs per the NCCAP, the assessment – which\nincludes a bottom-up assessment of mitigation\nopportunities and a top-down economy-wide\neconomic, energy and emissions model – provides\nthe evidence base for prioritising low-carbon\ndevelopment\nopportunities\nand,\nultimately,\ndeveloping investment proposals to attract\ninternational climate finance through nationally\nappropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) and\nreducing emissions from deforestation and forest\ndegradation plus the role of conservation,\nsustainable\nmanagement\nof\nforests\nand\nenhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+).\n\nMETHODOLOGY FOR THE MITIGATION\nASSESSMENT\n\nWithin the framework of Kenya’s national\ncircumstances and the country’s sustainable\ndevelopment objectives, Kenya has used available\nand appropriate methods in order to formulate\nand prioritise programmes containing measures to\nmitigate climate change. The measures applied\ninclude social, economic and environmental\nfactors.\n\nThe mitigation assessments conducted by Kenya\nentail the generation of information on the\nnational analysis of the potential costs and\nimpacts of the various technologies and practices\nto mitigate climate change, which are relevant for\nsustainable development and useful for policy\nmaking\nwith\nregard\nto\nformulation\nand\nprioritisation of mitigation programmes.\n\nUnder Subcomponent 4 of the NCCAP, a detailed\ntechnical analysis was undertaken to identify the\nmain elements of a low-carbon development\n\n135\n\npathway, recognising that the pathway needs to\nemphasise sustainable development and climate\nresilience co-benefits. This view was supported by\nstakeholders and experts through an extensive\nconsultation and validation process. The NCCAP’s\nlow carbon analysis carried out under the NCCAP\nprocess, and updated in this Second National\nCommunications, demonstrate that mitigation\nactions can contribute to low-carbon pathways in\nthe six sectors set out in the UNFCCC: energy,\ntransport, industry, agriculture, forestry and\nwaste. However, some of the sector baseline\nemissions are different as the Second National\nCommunications has applied the latest available\ndata. The emission reduction options and their\npotential however remain the same as those\ndetermined in the NCCAP. The general\nmethodology used to develop the low-carbon\nscenario assessment for the NCAPP is outlined in\nFigure 46. A detailed description of the\nmethodology is provided in Chapter 6 of the\nNCCAP.\n\nFigure 46: General methodology used to develop the low-carbon scenario assessment for the NCAPP\nThe mitigation assessment presented in this\nsection deviates from the NCCAP work identified\nin Figure 45 in only a few small ways. A new\nemissions reference case or business as usual\n\n136\n\nscenario is developed using the historical GHG\nemissions developed and presented in Chapter 2\nas well as from new available historical data from\n2011, 2012 and 2013. As a result emissions\nprojected for each sector to 2030 vary from the\nNCCAP work. In some cases this changes expected\nenergy demand or economic activity which affects\nthe emission reduction potential of the mitigation\noptions investigated under the NCCAP. Out of the\n31 mitigation actions considered under the NCCAP\napproximately 11 mitigation actions in the\nelectricity generation and energy demand sectors\nrequired significant updates due to baseline\nchanges.\n\nThe NCCAP provides full details of a range of\nadaptation and mitigation actions in the context\nof a low carbon climate resilient development\npathway. The actions have not been affected by\nthe updated data and the potentials are exactly as\nspecified in the NCCAP. The big wins identified will\nmake a significant impact on sustainable socioeconomic\ndevelopment,\nadaptation\nand\nmitigation in Kenya. They include:\nx Geothermal power generation\nx Restoration of forests on degraded lands and\nreforestation of degraded forests\nx Climate smart agriculture and agroforestry\nx Improved cookstoves\nx Mass rapid transit system in Nairobi, including\nbus rapid transit with light rail transit corridors\n\nAll these ‘big win’ opportunities combine climate\nresilience and mitigation benefits and capture\nover two-thirds of the mitigation potential\nidentified in the NCCAP low carbon assessment.\nMore specific mitigation actions proposed for\neach national planning sector are presented in this\nreport.\n\nEMISSION BASELINE PROJECTION\n\nAn assessment of mitigation options to be\nundertaken as Nationally Appropriate Mitigation\n\nActions (NAMAs) or other appropriate mitigation\nprogrammes requires that there is a projection of\nexpected baseline or business as usual emissions\ninto the future that accounts for existing\ngovernment policies from which to consider the\nimpact of individual NAMAs. It is important that\nthis projection reflects only existing policies,\nregulations and financial commitments and does\nnot account for potential new policies or account\nfor financing that is speculative in nature. For this\nreason, targets and goals expressed by the GoK in\nVision 2030 and elsewhere, have not been\nconsidered as constituting the baseline, unless\nappropriate policies have been put in place and\nfunds committed to reach them.\n\nThis section describes the methods used to\nproject baseline emissions for Kenya out to 2030\nfor the entire Kenyan economy and by sector and\nthen presents the results. The method applied is\nin line with the assessment done in the NCCAP.\nHowever, the data and information used for this\nchapter\nof\nKenya’s\nSecond\nNational\nCommunications has been updated to reflect new\ninformation and data that has been generated\nsince the NCCAP was prepared in 2012. The\ninformation is organised by the following seven\nsectors used for analysis in the low-carbon\nscenario analysis of the NCCAP:\n\nx Energy demand\nx Electricity generation\nx Transportation\nx Industrial processes\nx Agriculture\n\n137\n\nx Forestry\nx Waste.\n\nFinal projections of the baseline emissions for\neach sector out to 2030 are illustrated in Figure\n47.\n\nFigure 47: Emission Baseline Projection for Kenya (MtCO2e)\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nIndustrial Processes\nEnergy Demand\nTransportation\nLULUCF\nElectricity Generation\nAgriculture\n\nSector\nBaseline Emissions (MtCO2e)\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nAgriculture\n30\n23\n26\n30\n32\n34\n36\n39\nElectricity Generation\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n12\n24\n40\nLULUCF\n12\n21\n18\n21\n26\n25\n23\n20\nTransportation\n4\n4\n4\n7\n9\n12\n16\n17\nEnergy Demand\n4\n5\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nIndustrial Processes\n1\n1\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nWaste\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n4\nTOTAL\n52\n55\n57\n70\n80\n96\n115\n138\n\nIn the reference case, emissions increase up until\n2030 in all sectors except LULUCF:\n\nx Electricity emissions grow the most, increasing\nfrom 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide\nequivalent (MtCO2e) in 2010 to 40 MtCO2e in\n2030. Much of this increase is attributed to new\ncoal and natural gas coming online to meet\nincreasing energy demand.\n\n138\n\nx Forestry sector emissions are likely to decline\nafter 2020 due to the reduced clearing of forests\nand increases in the number and size of trees, a\nresult of tree planting programmes and a\nreduced projection in wood harvesting.\nx Agriculture and forestry sectors are the largest\nemitters, accounting for approximately 75 per\ncent of emissions in 2010 and 45 per cent in\n2030, mainly due to emissions from livestock\nand deforestation.\nx Emissions in other sectors grow significantly,\nwith transport emissions increasing by about\nthree times between 2010 and 2030, and\nemissions from the waste sector and energy\ndemand doubling in the same time period.\n\nEnergy Demand\n\nThe Energy demand sector includes all fuel\ncombustion emission sources that are not related\nto the electricity generation sector and the\ntransport sector. This includes fossil and biomass\n fuels consumed by residential, commercial,\nindustrial, agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors.\nFuture growth in petroleum product consumption\nin the Energy Demand Sector was estimated based\non the overall historic growth of all fossil fuels\nbetween 2000 and 2009. This total growth was\nestimated to be 3.4% per year. The growth rate in\ncoal consumption was based on the demand for\nenergy to meet future cement production,\nestimated to increase by 5% annually. Future\nbiomass consumption data were available from a\nUNEP study and these were used to estimate the\nbiomass growth rates.191 Table 49 summarises the\nassumptions that are used to develop the\nprojections of the inventory emissions between\n2011 and 2030.

Historical information on the total\nconsumption of different energy consumers\n(urban households, rural households, commercial\nand industry) is available from the data on\npetroleum fuels sales and a number of reports.\nHowever,\nthere\nis\nlittle\ncomprehensive\ninformation available on the end-use demand\nwhere these fuels are ultimately consumed, such\nas for cooking, lighting and heating water. A large\nnumber of reports provide details on usage\npatterns of households and ownership of\nappliances but this data only indirectly indicates\nactual energy consumption. Other data, especially\nfor biomass consumption, was often found to be\ncontradictory and therefore not reliable.\n\nEnd-use allocation is based on estimates from\nexperts and from the literature. There is no\ncomprehensive source of information in Kenya on\nthe historical end-use consumption patterns of\ndifferent consumers of biomass and fossil fuels. A\nlarge number of documents were reviewed that\nprovided some evidence of end-use consumption\npatterns or ownership of appliances specific to\ncertain fuels but this data was seldom aggregated\nto the national level or only indirectly indicated\nactual energy consumption.\n\nFor example, there was detailed data on the\ndistribution of cooking devices used by urban and\nrural households, but this data only indirectly\nindicated fuel consumption. Additional data or\nassumptions were required in order to estimate\nhow much fuel and what type of fuel was\nconsumed. Expert opinion or detailed end-use fuel\nconsumption patterns from other countries were\nin some cases used to identify the share of fuel\nused by different end-uses. As a result, there is a\nfair degree of uncertainty associated with the enduse allocation and a number of the estimates are\nnot Kenyan specific. However, the uncertainty in\nend-use allocation does not affect overall\nestimates of emissions, but it does impact the\nuncertainty associated with estimates of the\npotential for mitigation where specific end-uses\nare targeted.\n\nTable 51 summarises the allocation of different\nfuels to both consumers and specific end-uses.\nThe cement industrial sector is separated from the\nenergy consumption of all other industry.\n\nAdditives\n3,308\n4,613\n6,116\n8,108\n10,752\nFuelwood\n434,691\n457,966\n482,543\n508,495\n535,905\nCharcoal\n56,488\n60,176\n64,105\n68,291\n72,749\nAgricultural Residues\n82,630\n94,984\n109,186\n125,511\n144,277\n\n141\n\n142\n\nTable 42: Estimate of end-use consumption by fuel and consumer (%)\n\nEnd-Use Consumption by Fuel and Consumer (%)\nFuel\nConsumer\nTotal Fuel Share by\nConsumer\nCooking\nHot Water\nIndustrial\nProcess\nLighting\nKerosene\nUrban\n58%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n58%\nRural\n25%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n25%\nCommercial\n11%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n11%\nOther Industrial\n6%\n0%\n0%\n6%\n0%\nFuel Oil\nCommercial\n46%\n0%\n37%\n0%\n9%\nCement\n22%\n0%\n0%\n22%\n0%\nIndustrial\n32.2%\n0%\n0%\n54%\n0%\nHeavy Diesel\nOil\nCommercial\n70.7%\n0%\n57%\n0%\n14%\nIndustrial\n29.3%\n0%\n0%\n29%\n0%\nLubricants\nIndustrial\n100%\n0%\n0%\n100%\n0%\nLPG\nUrban\n44.7%\n45%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nRural\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nCommercial\n44.7%\n45%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n10.7%\n0%\n0%\n11%\n0%\nCoal\nCement\n100%\n0%\n0%\n100%\n0%\nAgricultural\nResidues\nUrban\n20%\n17%\n1%\n0%\n2%\nRural\n60%\n51%\n3%\n0%\n6%\nCommercial\n10%\n8%\n2%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n10%\n0%\n0%\n10%\n0%\nFuelwood\nUrban\n5%\n4%\n0%\n0%\n1%\nRural\n80%\n68%\n4%\n0%\n8%\nCommercial\n10%\n8%\n2%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n5%\n0%\n0%\n5%\n0%\nCharcoal\nUrban\n75%\n75%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nRural\n20%\n20%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nCommercial\n5%\n5%\n0%\n0%\n0%\nIndustrial\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n0%\n\n143\n\nElectricity Generation\n\nDeveloping a baseline projection for Kenya’s\nelectricity sector is challenging because there is\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding how the sector\nmay grow to meet a large suppressed demand for\nelectricity. Specific plans are in place but they\nassume very high growth rates. The Updated\nLeast Cost Power Development Plan (ULCPDP)\npresumes a 14% per annum growth rate in\nelectricity supply between 2010 and 2030 in their\nreference case.192 This compares to historical\ngrowth in electricity supply of about 7% between\n2000 and 2010. The cost to achieve this dramatic\ngrowth is estimated at U.S$ 41.4 billion (excluding\ncommitted\nprojects)\nwhile\ngeneration\ntechnologies that are expected to make up the\nvast majority of new supply still face considerable\nbarriers to implementation.193 Technologies such\nas nuclear, coal and wind have either not been\nproven in Kenya or have limited current\npenetration. Geothermal, which is expected to\ncomprise the largest portion of generation, has\nhigh initial costs, long lead times and risk of\nresource exploration that must be overcome.\n\nThe baselines outlined in the NCAPP and in this\nsection are in line with each other but they are not\nidentical to the reference case in the Updated\nLeast Cost Power Development Plan.194 This is\nbecause the objective of the baseline emissions\nforecast is to consider a scenario based on existing\npolicies and regulations and assume no growth in\ninternational\naid\nand\nrelated\ninternational\ninvestments.\nSpecifically,\nany\nadditional\ninternational\nsupport\nand\ninvestment\nfor\nelectricity generation projects that may be tied to\nlow-carbon development are not included in the\nemissions reference case, unless the international\nsupport and related investments have already\nbeen committed. Including such international\nsupport would mean that\nthe\nsubstantial\nrenewable generation investment in geothermal,\nwind and small hydro in the aspiration of Vision\n2030 reference case could not be part of a NAMA,\nfor\nexample.\nConsequently,\nincluding\nthis\npotential investment in the baseline would mean\nthat billions of dollars in investment opportunity\nthrough the development of NAMAs and other\nmitigation projects could not be considered in the\nmitigation\nscenario.\n\nFigure 48\nFigure 48 compares the total installed capacity between 2010\nand 2030 presented in the reference case adopted in this\nlow-carbon analysis to the reference case in the Updated\nLeast Cost Power Development Plan.195\n\n144\n\nFigure 48: Comparison of installed capacity between 2010 and 2030\n0\n2,000\n4,000\n6,000\n8,000\n10,000\n12,000\n14,000\n16,000\n18,000\n20,000\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nInstalled Capacity (MW)\nULCDP\nReference\nCase\nReference\nCase\n\nRevised projections of short-term generating\ncapacity installations were provided by the then\nMinistry of Energy (now Ministry of Energy and\nPetroleum).196 Table 52 outlines the new\ngeneration capacity that is included in the\nbaseline for the years between 2012 and 2017.\n\n145\n\nTable 43: Information provided from the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum on new capacity additions\nNew Additions to Capacity Between 2012 and 2017\nNew power plants and generating\ncapacity that will come online in the\nnext five years\n2012\nHYDRO 21MW – Sang\nGeothermal 2.3 MW – Eburru\nGeothermal 75 MW – Olkaria\n2013\nWind 60MW - Aeolus\nMSD 81MW - Triumph\nMSD 84MW - Gulf\nMSD 87MW - Melec\nMSD 80MW – Muhoroni\nWind 6.8 MW - Ngong\n2014\nGeothermal 140 MW – Olk4\nWind 300 MW - Turkana\nGeothermal 36 MW - Olk3\nWind 50 MW - Osiwo\nHydro 32 MW- Kindaruma\nGeothermal 140 MW - Olk 1 – 4&5\n2015\nGeothermal 280MW\nHydro 6 MW – small hydro\n2016\nIMPORT 400MW\nCoal 600MW - Mombasa\n2017\nGeothermal 140MW\nGeothermal 45MW\n\nFor years beyond 2017, the baseline projection\ndeviates from the Updated Least Cost Power\nDevelopment Plan 2011 reference case in order to\nreflect a baseline that is based on existing policies\nand regulations and assumes no growth in\ninternational\naid\nand\nrelated\ninternational\ninvestments, specifically assuming no additional\ninternational support that would be tied to\nNAMAs or similar mitigation activities. Since there\nis no gas generation in the medium term, the\nanalysis adopts the trend identified in the ULCDP.\nImports also assumed follow the same trend as\nthe ULCDP. All other technologies including coal,\nmedium-speed diesel (MSD), wind, hydro and\ngeothermal are based on the same rate of growth\ngeneration capacity that is installed in the medium\nterm plan (2012 to 2017). In the baseline it is\nassumed that no nuclear energy will be added\nbefore 2030. Figure 49 compares the installed\ncapacity of different technologies in 2030 in the\nreference case adopted in the low-carbon analysis\nto the reference case that is presented in the\nUpdated Least Cost Power Development Plan.197\n\n146\n\nFigure 49: Comparison of installed capacity in 2030 (MW)\n0\n1,000\n2,000\n3,000\n4,000\n5,000\n6,000\nCapacity in 2030 (MW)\nBaseline Projection\nULCDP Reference\n\nTotal generation capacity under the GHG\nemissions reference case is 11,191 MW in 2030\nversus from 17,220 MW under the Updated Least\nCost Power Development Plan.

The summarised\ninvestment costs for implementing the six low\ncarbon options to 2030 are shown on Table 66.\nThe details of these costs are provided in the\nNCCAP.\n\nThe methodology used for calculating these primary\ncosts is detailed in the Low Carbon – Mitigation\nAnnexes of the NCCAP. It is estimated that KSh839\n– 1,110 billion of these investment costs would\nhave to be borne by the public sector, with the\nremaining costs covered by private sector and\nhousehold investments. Kenya sees clear potential\nto make effective use of bilateral and multilateral\nfunding, as well as international climate finance\nmechanisms – such as the Green Climate Fund\nand emerging NAMAs and REDD+ mechanisms– in\nmoving forward with the implementation of these\nactions.\n\nTable 57: Projected investment costs for priority mitigation actions\n\n153\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\n\n154\n\nSUMMARY OF MITIGATION ACTIONS\n\nBased\non\nthe\ncomprehensive\nbottom-up\nassessment in the NCCAP and the update\nconducted during the preparation of the Second\nNational Communication, six proposed priority\nareas for low carbon development and proposals\nfor their implementation are described in Table 67\nbelow. These six priority areas cover about threequarters of total abatement potentials found in\nthis study. Their full deployment would almost\nhalve GHG emissions by 2030 compared to the\nreference\ncase\nscenario\n(cross-sectoral\ninteractions not taken into account). Investment\ncosts would vary, but significant reductions can be\nobtained at marginal costs of less than US$15 per\ntonne of carbon. Some of these options also\ndeliver fuel savings, which may result in overall\nsocial cost savings relative to high emitting\noptions.\n\nSignificant investments will be required and a\nseries of barriers will need to be addressed before\nthe low-carbon opportunities can be realised.\nImplementing the six priority low carbon actions\nwould require investments of KSh 1,371 – 1,773\nbillion (USD 16.12 – 20.84 billion) until 2030\n(equivalent to a Net Present Value of KSh600 –\n770 billion at a real discount rate of 10 per cent).\nOut of these investment costs, it is estimated that\nKSh839 – 1,110 billion would have to be borne by\nthe public sector, with the remaining costs\ncovered\nby\nprivate\nsector\nand\nhousehold\ninvestments. A large challenge is financing the\nhigher upfront costs of low carbon investments.\nKenya sees clear potential to make effective use of\nbilateral and multilateral funding, as well as\ninternational climate finance mechanisms – such\nas the Green Climate Fund and the international\nsupport likely to be mobilised to support the\nemerging NAMA and REDD+ mechanisms– in\nmoving forward on the Action Plan, in addition to\nsystematic domestic support.\n\n155\n\n156\n\n157\n\nTable 60: Summary of Mitigation Actions\nNumber\nAction\nEstimated Cost\nKSh to 2030\nMITI-1\n\nRestoration of Forests on Degraded Lands -Undertake a programme of\nwork to restore forests on 960,000 hectares up to 2030 including: inter alia\ndryland forest restoration activities; awareness raising, consultation and\ndemonstration; capacity building; development, testing and application of\ncompensation and benefits-sharing mechanisms; measuring, monitoring and\nti\nd\nh\n186-290billion\n\nMITI-2\n\nGeothermal - Develop an additional 2,275 MW of geothermal capacity by\n2030 through a support programme aimed at encouraging private sector\ninvestment.

While strong growth will likely continue due to high\ndemand projected average growth between 2010 and 2030 is\nestimated to be somewhat lower than this historical growth rate.\nGrowth in 2010 was approximately 6%.\nGrowth in Service\nDemand (vehicle\nkm travelled)\n+1% per year\nIncreased travel per vehicle is likely as this is a trend that has been\nobserved in most countries where road networks are being expanded\nas is the case in Kenya; however, this growth rate is expected to be\nvery small due to the limited capacity of current roadways to handle\nboth new vehicle stock and additional traffic.\nChange in fuel\nefficiency of\npassenger\nvehicles\n+1.8% per year\nHistoric improvements between 2000 and 2010 in average fleet wide\nfuel efficiency are low. This may be explained by the fact that average\ncar size, and proportion of trucks and SUV vehicles increased over the\nlast decade. We assume that fuel efficiency will improve at an\nincreased rate going forward. New fuel efficiency is based on a fleet\nturnover rate of 4% (average lifetime of vehicle 25 years) and an\naverage improvement in fuel economy of new vehicles compared to\non-road vehicles determined from fuel economy data for Japanese\nvehicles. The average improvements in fuel economy for new vehicles\nis 33% for passenger vehicles,\n\n160\n\nChange in fuel\nefficiency of\nfreight vehicles\n+1.2% per year\nHistoric improvements between 2000 and 2010 in average fleet wide\nfuel efficiency are low. This may be explained by the fact that average\ncar size, and proportion of trucks and SUV vehicles increased over the\nlast decade. We assume that fuel efficiency will improve at an\nincreased rate going forward. New fuel efficiency is based on a fleet\nturnover rate of 4% (average lifetime of vehicle 25 years) and an\naverage improvement in fuel economy of new vehicles compared to\non-road vehicles determined from fuel economy data for Japanese\nvehicles. The average improvements in fuel economy is 25% for freight\nvehicles.\n\nRail, marine and domestic aviation sub-sectors\nwere assumed to have an average demand growth\nof 4.4%. This growth rate is in line with current\nprojections for the economy and business as usual\nestimates in the growth rate of transport\npetroleum demand in a UNEP study.198 An average\nimprovement in fuel efficiency of 1% was\nassumed.\nThis\nefficiency\nimprovement\nis\nconsistent with an increase in rail fuel efficiency of\n1.1% per year in the United States between 1990\nand 2006.199\n\nIn order to look at low-carbon options that\ndifferentiate between personal passenger, bus\nand freight vehicles it is necessary to divide the\ntotal consumption of on-road transportation fuels\nindicated in Table 98 into these end-uses. This is\nchallenging because there is limited information\non the fuel usage by end-use in Kenya. The basis\nfor the on-road allocation by end-use was vehicle\nregistration data between 2000 and 2006200 and\ndetailed vehicle registration data on new vehicles\navailable for 2005 and 2008.201 Table 60 below\nindicates the distribution by on-road vehicle type.\nPassenger vehicles include all personal passenger\nvehicles including motorcycles.\n\nTable 51: Distribution of vehicle types in Kenya based on historic data\nType\nHistoric Fleet (2006)\nPassenger Vehicles\n85.8%\nBuses\n5.3%\nFreight Vehicles\n8.9%\nTOTAL\n100%\n\nNew vehicle registration data between 2005 and\n2008202 indicates that approximately 22% of the\nnewly registered vehicles in this period were\ndiesel and 78% were gasoline. There are several\n\n161\n\nreasons why this historic share is likely not\nindicative of the average share in the on-road fleet\nof vehicles.\n\nTable 52: Share of vehicles by fuel type for passenger, buses and freight vehicles\nVehicle Type\nFuel\n% Share\nVehicles in 2010\nPersonal Passenger\nVehicles\nDiesel\n32%\n329,475\nPetrol\n68%\n700,135\nALL\n100%\n1,029,610\nBuses\nDiesel\n90.0%\n57,169\nPetrol\n10.0%\n6,352\nALL\n100.0%\n63,521\nFreight Vehicles\nDiesel\n90.0%\n96,182\nPetrol\n10.0%\n10,687\nALL\n100.0%\n106,869\nTOTAL\nDiesel\n40%\n482,826\nTOTAL\nPetrol\n60%\n717,174\nTOTAL\nTOTAL\n100%\n1,200,000\n\nFirst, is the rising share of gasoline vehicles in\nrecent years and second, is that vehicle lifetime\nfor diesel vehicles is on average longer. Based on\nthese factors, the share of passenger diesel\nvehicles was adjusted to 32% of the total, and the\nshare of diesel buses and freight vehicles was\nadjusted to 90%. Table 61 indicates the vehicle\ntype and fuel shares used in the model.\n\nTotal projections of on-road vehicle population by\nfuel and vehicle type are shown in Figure 51\nrelative to the total Kenyan population (black\n\nline). This figure illustrates that the number of\nvehicles is expected to increase significantly faster\nthan for overall population. In 2010 vehicle\n\nownership was approximately 30.7 vehicles per\nthousand population. This level of ownership\nmore than doubles in 2030 to 69.9 vehicles per\nthousand population.\n\nFigure 51: On-road vehicle population growth in Kenya (millions)\n\n162\n\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nKenya Population (millions)\nOn-Road Vehicle Population (millions)\nFreight Vehicles\nPetrol\nFreight Vehicles\nDiesel\nBuses Petrol\nBuses Diesel\nPassenger Vehicles\nPetrol\nPassenger Vehicles\nDiesel\nPopulation Millions\n\nBaseline projections of transportation emissions\nbroken down by fuel type and major end-use is\nindicated in Figure 52.\n\nFigure 52: Baseline greenhouse gas emission projections for the transportation sector\n\n163\n\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MtCO2e\nHeavy diesel oil Navigation\nGasoline - Freight\nVehicles\nJet Kerosene Aviation\nLight diesel oil Freight Vehicles\nGasoline - Passenger\nVehicles\nLight diesel oil Passenger Vehicles\n\nIndustrial Processes\nIn Kenya the main industrial processes emission\nsources\nare\nreleases\nfrom\nprocesses\nthat\nchemically or physically transform materials (for\nexample, cement, lime and soda ash are notable\nexamples where there are processes that release\na significant amount of CO2).

The\nprobability of transitioning a parcel of land from\none state (a particular land-use classification) to\nanother is defined in the model based on available\ndata on land-use change, management activities\nand disturbances.\nProjections of land-use changes and biomass\nremovals (e.g., wood, charcoal, timber) that\nimpact emissions and removals from LULUCF\nbetween 2011 and 2030 are based on a number of\ndifferent assumptions which are summarised in\nTable 64.\nTable 55: Projection assumptions for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry\nEmission /\nRemoval\nCategory\nMetric\nAssumption\nNotes\nConversion of\nForest Land to\nFarm lands\nHa converted\nper year\nbetween 1990\nand 2010\nReduced by\n50% between\n2010 and 2030\nIncreased protection and forest management under the\nForest Conservation And Management Bill, 2014 is expected\nto reduce the rate of deforestation.

The breakdown of\nhuman sewage can also lead to significant\namounts of indirect N2O emissions.\nHistoric solid waste data disposal was estimated\nfrom Environmental Impact Assessments for four\nsolid waste disposal sites in Kenya (Dandora,\nMombasa, Kisumu and Nakuru).

In addition, there has been a strong focus\non expanding geothermal power, which is\nconsidered a key enabler for Kenya’s economic\ngrowth. Although geothermal is the most\npromising renewable energy source, Kenya also\nhas excellent bioenergy, solar, wind and hydro\nresources for the supply of electricity.\n\nThe analysis of six low carbon development\noptions for electricity supply (Figure 58) shows\nthat geothermal power has by far the largest\nabatement potential (14 MtCO2e per year) in\n2030, with other technologies varying between\n0.5 and 1.4 MtCO2e. Increasing the share of\nrenewable electricity can have benefits in terms of\nenergy security (through decreased energy\nimports) and reduced costs of generation. In\nparticular, geothermal power can provide low-cost\nbase load generation, facilitating economic\n\nactivity and development. It would also reduce\nthe current reliance on hydropower thereby\nimproving climate resilience.\n\nAs part of the NCCAP implementation, the Kenya\nhas\nalready\ndeveloped\na\nNAMA\nfor\nthe\nacceleration of geothermal development in Kenya.\nThis NAMA has been posted in the NAMA registry.\n\nEnergy Demand\n\nEnergy demand includes the final use of electricity\nand other sources of energy, such as biomass\ncombustion. At present, roughly 25 per cent of the\npopulation is connected to the electricity grid.\nAbout 60 per cent of electricity is consumed by\nthe commercial and industrial sectors, while\napproximately 25 per cent is used by households.\nDirect fuel combustion of biomass from wood\nsources, such as fuelwood and charcoal, is the\ndominant fuel source in Kenya, accounting for\nalmost 70 per cent of primary, non-electricity,\nnon-transport energy demand. This has placed the\nforests under pressure and has led to widespread\nscarcity of biomass. Direct fuel use in the\nindustrial and commercial sectors is relatively low.\nMoreover, the energy sector may be an important\ntransition point. The exploitation of indigenous\ncoal resources is beginning and domestic oil\nresources were discovered in early 2012.\n\nElectricity\ndemand,\nparticularly\nhousehold\ndemand, is expected to rise sharply with\ncontinued economic development and a growing\nshare of the population gaining access to\nelectricity. Even when using a conservative\napproach to estimate future energy demand,\nenergy-related GHG emissions are expected to\nincrease from 8 MtCO2e in 2010 to 50 MtCO2e in\n2030.\n\nEight low carbon development options were\nanalysed in the energy demand sector (Figure 58).\nImproved cookstoves that reduce the volume of\nbiomass required for cooking have the largest\n\n174\n\npotential for GHG emission reductions, 5.6 Mt\nCO2e a year in 2030. Replacing kerosene lamps\nwith renewable lighting technologies, using\nliquefied petroleum gas (LPG) instead of fuelwood\nfor cooking, and cogeneration of heat and power\nin agriculture were also found to have significant\nabatement potentials of over 1.5 MtCO2e a year in\n2030. The opportunities for promoting energy\nefficiency are captured under energy efficiency\nacross\nindustry,\nenergy\nefficient\nelectrical\nappliances and energy efficient light bulbs.\n\nSustainable development benefits associated with\nthe use of improved fuelwood or charcoal-based\nand LPG-based cookstoves include significant\nhealth benefits as a result of reduced indoor air\npollution. Health benefits are also expected with\nthe\nreplacement\nof\nkerosene\nlamps\nwith\ndistributed renewable energy (such as solar)\nlanterns. These technologies can also bring cost\nsavings to consumers, depending on the price of\nalternatives. Improved cookstoves and the use of\nLPG for cooking contribute to increased climate\nresilience as they lower fuelwood demand and\nreduce pressure on forests.\n\nFigure 58: Low carbon development wedge for energy demand\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nCogeneration in Agriculture\nCement Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\nIndustrial Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\nEnergy Efficient Light Bulbs\nSolar Thermal Water Heating\nRenewable Lamps\nLPG Stove Substitution\nImproved Cookstoves\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n\n175\n\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nImproved Cookstoves\n1.49\n2.35\n3.30\n5.22\nLPG Stove Substitution\n0.45\n0.71\n0.99\n1.30\nRenewable Lamps\n0.46\n0.70\n1.02\n1.51\nSolar Thermal Water Heating\n0.00\n0.02\n0.06\n0.14\nEnergy Efficient Light Bulbs\n0.01\n0.12\n0.39\n1.00\nIndustrial Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\n0.16\n0.48\n0.77\n1.15\nCement Energy Efficiency\nImprovement\n0.05\n0.07\n0.17\n0.21\nCogeneration in Agriculture\n0.13\n0.72\n1.23\n1.64\n\nElectricity Generation\n\nFigure 59: Low carbon development wedge for electricity supply\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nClean Coal (USC)\nLandfill gas generation\nSolar PV -distributed gridconnected\nHydro generation expansion\nWind generation expansion\nWind generation baseline\nGeothermal generation\nexpansion\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n\n176\n\n201\n5\n202\n0\n202\n5\n2030\nGeothermal generation\nexpansion\n0.00\n1.01\n6.37\n14.07\nWind generation baseline\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\nWind generation expansion\n0.00\n0.20\n0.33\n1.36\nHydro generation expansion\n0.25\n0.42\n0.76\n1.10\nSolar PV - distributed gridconnected\n0.00\n0.11\n0.29\n0.65\nLandfill gas generation\n0.02\n0.14\n0.21\n0.34\nClean Coal (USC)\n0.00\n0.36\n0.65\n1.11\n\nNote: The methodological approach for the\nelectricity sector analysis deviates from a\ntraditional analysis of climate mitigation options.\nUsually, mitigation options are assumed to replace\na business as usual alternative or reference mix\n(Figure 59). However, for this analysis, the\nambitious electricity expansion plans needed to\nsatisfy Vision 2030 were assumed to be supply\nconstrained in the absence of external support.\nInternational climate finance for low-carbon\ndevelopment opportunities provides the funding\nfor additional capacity expansion that would not\nbe installed in the reference case.\n\nTransportation\n\nKenya’s transport sector is dominated by road\ntransport. The total vehicle population (excluding\nmotorcycles) is estimated to have doubled from\n600,000 vehicles in 2000 to 1,200,000 vehicles in\n2010. Public transport is relatively underdeveloped and is dominated by minibuses\n(matatus). The vast majority of freight transport,\nincluding transit freight headed to other countries,\nis served by trucks. At the same time, increasing\nurbanisation and the growth of major cities have\nput pressure on urban transport systems and\ninfrastructure. In Nairobi and other major cities,\nsevere traffic congestion, especially during the\nextended peak hours, contributes to local air\npollution and leads to significant economic losses\nin time and fuel. That said, the majority of\nindividual trips in cities are still by foot because\npublic transport services are comparatively\nexpensive and private cars are out of the financial\nreach of the majority of Kenyans.\n\nWith the sector experiencing strong growth, GHG\nemissions from transport are projected to grow\nsignificantly from 7 MtCO2e in 2010 to almost 20\nMtCO2e in 2030 (Figure 60). Improved traffic\nconditions and access to modern transport\nservices are required, along with increased\nefficiency\nthrough\nimproved\ntechnologies,\nalternative (including non-motorised) modes of\ntransport and fuel substitution.\n\nSeven low carbon development options were\nanalysed for the transport sector (Figure 5.4). The\noption with the largest mitigation potential is the\ndevelopment of an extensive mass transit system\nfor greater Nairobi in the form of bus rapid transit\n(BRT) corridors, complemented by light rail transit\n(LRT) in very high thorough fare corridors. This\n\n177\n\npublic transport system has an abatement\npotential of approximately 2.8 MtCO2e a year in\ntotal. The second largest mitigation potential is\nthe introduction of biodiesel, with a 10 per cent\nblend\nrequirement\nhaving\na\npotential\nof\napproximately 1.2 MtCO2e a year in 2030. The\nabatement potentials for the other low-carbon\ndevelopment options vary between 0.5 and 0.8\nMtCO2e a year in 2030.\n\nAccording to the Nairobi County Government, the\nBRT system implementation programme has been\nstarted in early 2015. A BRT system NAMA is also\nunderway as part of the implementation of the\nNCCAP.\nIn\naddition,\nKenya\nhas\nalready\ncommissioned the construction of a standard\ngauge railway from the Port of Mombasa all the\nway to the City of Kisumu. This will facilitate high\nspeed train transport and is expected to shift a\nsignificant passenger and freight transport from\nroad to rail.\n\nIntroducing\nlarge-scale\nbus\nrapid\ntransit\n(potentially complemented with some light rail\ntransit) has significant associated benefits in terms\nof reduced traffic congestion, improved local air\nquality and improved road safety. These options\nare in line with the priorities of the Government of\nKenya, which has started to secure funding for\nthese actions. A shift of freight transport from\nroad to rail through modernising and extending\nthe existing rail network would facilitate regional\ntrade, as well as improve traffic safety and road\ninfrastructure lifetimes. While the use of biofuels\nwould lower GHG emissions and the need for\nfossil fuel imports, large-scale production of\nbiofuels could compete for land with food\nproduction if poorly planned; any move towards\ncommercial growing of biofuel crops should be\npursued in a well-regulated manner.\n\nFigure 60: Low carbon development wedge for transportation\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nFreight from Road to Rail\nLRT Nairobi\nBRT Nairobi\nBioethanol\nBiodiesel\nImproved Heavy-Duty Vehicle\nStock Efficiency\nImproved Passenger Vehicle\nStock Efficiency\n\n178\n\nIndustrial Processes\n\nThe industrial sector is relatively small in Kenya,\nboth in terms of its share of GDP and contribution\nto total GHG emissions (in terms of process\nemissions). 95 per cent of industrial process\nemissions in Kenya are created by two industries:\ncement manufacturing (1.9 MtCO2e in 2010) and\ncharcoal manufacturing (0.8 MtCO2e in 2010). The\nfigures for charcoal production assume that the\nfeedstock used is completely carbon neutral. If 35\nper cent unsustainable biomass usage is assumed,\nemissions from charcoal production increase to\n4.3 MtCO2e.\n\nIn the reference scenario, emissions from charcoal\nproduction are projected to remain relatively\nstable, while emissions from cement production\nincrease to 4.4 MtCO2e in 2030. Process emissions\nfrom cement manufacturing can be reduced by\nreplacing clinker in the cement mix with\nalternative materials. Although some Kenyan\ncement companies are already implementing this\napproach to varying degrees, this was not\nconsidered in this low carbon analysis. The most\nsignificant low carbon development opportunity is\nthe introduction of more efficient kilns for\ncharcoal production, with an abatement potential\nof 1.6 MtCO2e per year in 2030 (see Figure 61).\nSustainable development benefits include reduced\nfuelwood demand leading to lower levels of\ndeforestation.\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nImproved Passenger Vehicle Stock\nEfficiency\n0.10\n0.22\n0.42\n0.64\nImproved Heavy-Duty Vehicle Stock\nEfficiency\n0.03\n0.11\n0.55\n0.84\nBiodiesel\n0.10\n0.65\n0.88\n1.21\nBioethanol\n0.23\n0.30\n0.40\n0.55\nBRT Nairobi\n0.82\n1.64\n1.98\n2.28\nLRT Nairobi\n0.21\n0.41\n0.50\n0.57\nFreight from Road to Rail\n0.05\n0.18\n0.40\n0.83\n\n179\n\nFigure 61: Low carbon development wedge for industrial processes\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nImproved Charcoal Production\nSystem\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nImproved Charcoal Production\nSystem\n0.26\n0.69\n1.03\n1.56\n\nAgriculture\n\nAgriculture is the largest source of GHG emissions;\nit was responsible for more than one-third of\nKenya’s total emissions in 2010. Agricultural\nemissions are likely to increase from 30 MtCO2e in\n2010 to 35 MtCO2e in 2030 (Figure 61), largely\ndriven by livestock methane emissions and land\nuse change , which account for 90 per cent of\nagriculture emissions and about 30 per cent of\noverall national emissions. The sector also plays\nan important role in sequestering carbon in soil\nand trees on farms.\n\nAgricultural low carbon development options have\nthe potential to abate in the order of 6 MtCO2e\nper year in 2030 (Figure 62). The most significant\nreduction can be achieved through agroforestry,\nwhich has an abatement potential of 4 MtCO2e\n\n180\n\nper year in 2030. Other low carbon development\noptions include conservation tillage and limiting\nthe\nuse\nof\nfire\nin\nrange\nand\ncropland\nmanagement, with abatement potentials of over\n1.1 and 1.2 MtCO2e per year in 2030, respectively.\nThese three options are elements of a climatesmart agriculture approach, and a framework to\nencourage investment in climate-smart agriculture\nwill be an important action.\n\nLow\ncarbon\ndevelopment\nactions\nin\nthe\nagricultural sector have important sustainable\ndevelopment\nbenefits,\nincluding\nimproved\nretention of water and nutrients in the soil, and\nreduced soil erosion. These actions increase soil\nfertility and crop yields, improving food security\nand the livelihoods of farmers. Such efforts are\nimportant in arid and semi-arid lands where\nclimate conditions are expected to become more\nextreme. Efforts to increase agroforestry will help\nmeet Kenya’s goal of increasing tree cover on\nfarmland to 10 per cent as a means to preserving\nand maintaining the environment and combating\nclimate change.\n\nImportant actions related to the livestock sector\ninclude manure management through biogas\npromotion, and rangeland pasture rehabilitation,\nmanagement and conservation. In addition,\nactions to help farmers and pastoralists adapt to\nclimate change, discussed in Adaptation chapter\nof this Second National Communication , should\nbe undertaken in a manner that is as low-carbon\nas possible, complemented by awareness raising\nand education.\n\nFigure 62: Low carbon development wedge for agriculture\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\n40\n45\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nLimiting use of Fire in\nRange and Cropland\nManagement\nAgroforestry\nConservation Tillage\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\n181\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nConservation Tillage\n0.11\n0.65\n1.09\n1.09\nAgroforestry\n0.28\n1.66\n3.05\n4.16\nLimiting use of Fire in Range and Cropland\nManagement\n0.24\n0.26\n0.27\n0.29\n\nLULUCF\n\nForestry and other land use related emissions\naccounted for 23 MtCO2e in 2010, or about 32 per\ncent of national emissions. Emissions primarily\noriginate from deforestation, where forests are\ncleared for fuelwood and charcoal production or\nto create agricultural land. The Government of\nKenya is working to increase tree cover to 10 per\ncent of total land area – a goal stated in the 2010\nconstitution.\n\nEmissions are expected to increase to 26 MtCO2e\nin 2015 and then decline to 22 MtCO2e by 2030,\n(See Figure 63). Reduced deforestation and\nincreases in the carbon stock of trees contribute\nto the decline in emissions. On-going GoK REDD+\nactivities are taken into account in the reference\ncase. Low carbon development actions in the\nforestry sector have the potential to abate an\nadditional 40 MtCO2e per year in 2030 compared\nto the baseline (Figure 63).\n\nThe most significant abatement potential can be\nachieved through restoration of forests on\ndegraded lands. Abatement potential of 32.6\nMtCO2e per year by 2030 is likely through\nconservation and sustainable forest management\ninterventions. Restoration of degraded forests has\nan abatement potential of 6.1 MtCO2e per year by\n2030, and reducing deforestation and forest\ndegradation potentially can abate 1.6 MtCO2e per\nyear by 2030.\n\nKenya’s forest resources provide important\nenvironmental and ecosystem services, and\ncontribute to economic development, rural\nlivelihoods,\nwater\navailability\nand\nclimate\nresilience (adaptation benefits). Maintenance of\nand increased forest cover in water catchments is\ncritical for sustaining water availability and the\ngeneration of hydropower.\n\n182\n\nFigure 63: Low carbon development wedge for the LULUCF\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nGHG Emissions MTCO2e\nReducing Deforestation\nand Forest Degradation\nReforestation of\nDegraded Forests\nRestoration of Forests\non Degraded Lands\nLow Carbon Pathway\n\nEmission Reductions (MtCO2e)\n2015\n2020\n2025\n2030\nRestoration of Forests on Degraded Lands\n2.17\n13.03\n23.88\n32.56\nReforestation of Degraded Forests\n0.40\n2.42\n4.44\n6.06\nReducing Deforestation and Forest\nDegradation\n0.13\n0.79\n1.44\n1.57\n\nWaste\n\nLandfills and sewage treatment plants generate\nGHG emissions through the production of\nmethane.

The summarised\ninvestment costs for implementing the six low\ncarbon options to 2030 are shown on Table 66.\nThe details of these costs are provided in the\nNCCAP.\n\nThe methodology used for calculating these\nprimary costs is detailed in the Low Carbon –\nMitigation Annexes of the NCCAP. It is estimated\nthat KSh839 – 1,110 billion of these investment\ncosts would have to be borne by the public sector,\nwith the remaining costs covered by private sector\nand household investments. Kenya sees clear\npotential to make effective use of bilateral and\nmultilateral funding, as well as international\nclimate finance mechanisms – such as the Green\nClimate Fund and emerging NAMAs and REDD+\nmechanisms– in moving forward with the\nimplementation of these actions.\n\nTable 57: Projected investment costs for priority mitigation actions\n\n185\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\n\n186\n\nSUMMARY OF MITIGATION ACTIONS\n\nBased\non\nthe\ncomprehensive\nbottom-up\nassessment in the NCCAP and the update\nconducted during the preparation of the Second\nNational Communication, six proposed priority\nareas for low carbon development and proposals\nfor their implementation are described in Table 67\nbelow. These six priority areas cover about threequarters of total abatement potentials found in\nthis study. Their full deployment would almost\nhalve GHG emissions by 2030 compared to the\nreference\ncase\nscenario\n(cross-sectoral\ninteractions not taken into account). Investment\ncosts would vary, but significant reductions can be\nobtained at marginal costs of less than US$15 per\ntonne of carbon. Some of these options also\ndeliver fuel savings, which may result in overall\nsocial cost savings relative to high emitting\noptions.\n\nSignificant investments will be required and a\nseries of barriers will need to be addressed before\nthe low-carbon opportunities can be realised.\nImplementing the six priority low carbon actions\nwould require investments of KSh 1,371 – 1,773\nbillion (USD 16.12 – 20.84 billion) until 2030\n(equivalent to a Net Present Value of KSh600 –\n770 billion at a real discount rate of 10 per cent).\nOut of these investment costs, it is estimated that\nKSh839 – 1,110 billion would have to be borne by\nthe public sector, with the remaining costs\ncovered\nby\nprivate\nsector\nand\nhousehold\ninvestments. A large challenge is financing the\nhigher upfront costs of low carbon investments.\nKenya sees clear potential to make effective use of\nbilateral and multilateral funding, as well as\ninternational climate finance mechanisms – such\nas the Green Climate Fund and the international\nsupport likely to be mobilised to support the\nemerging NAMA and REDD+ mechanisms– in\nmoving forward on the Action Plan, in addition to\nsystematic domestic support.\n\n187\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\nTable 58: Suggested priority low-carbon development opportunities up to 2030\n\n188\n\nSource: GoK NCCAP Mitigation Analysis 2012\nTable 59: Suggested priority low-carbon development opportunities up to 2030 (continued)\n\n189\n\nTable 60: Summary of Mitigation Actions\nNumber\nAction\nEstimated Cost\nKSh to 2030\nMITI-1\n\nRestoration of Forests on Degraded Lands -Undertake a programme of work\nto restore forests on 960,000 hectares up to 2030 including: inter alia\ndryland forest restoration activities; awareness raising, consultation and\ndemonstration; capacity building; development, testing and application of\ncompensation and benefits-sharing mechanisms; measuring, monitoring and\nti\nd\nh\n186-290billion\n\nMITI-2\n\nGeothermal - Develop an additional 2,275 MW of geothermal capacity by\n2030 through a support programme aimed at encouraging private sector\ninvestment.

The report is structured as follows:\nSection 2 covers the steps taken to integrate\nclimate change into relevant social, economic\nand environmental policies and the relevant\nnational, social, economic and environmental\npolicies and activities geared towards the\nimplementation of the Convention.\n\nSection 3 briefly describes the activities related\nto technology transfer, including the country’s\ntechnology needs assessments. It covers the\npriority needs on transfer of know-how and\naccess to ESTs, including measures relating to\nenhancing the enabling environment for their\ndevelopment. Also illustrated are the country’s\ncurrent and planned technology transfer\nmechanisms, development and enhancement of\nthe country’s endogenous capacities and knowhow, especially as relates to the grid connected\nenergy.\n\nSection 4 provides a description of the country’s\nclimate change observation and research\nsystems, including research to adapt to and\nmitigate climate change and the country’s\nparticipation in, and contribution to, activities\nand programmes, as appropriate to its national,\nregional and global research networks.\n\nSection 5 provides information on climate\nchange\neducation,\ntraining\nand\npublic\nawareness in the country. This includes plans of\nthe country in strengthening the mainstreaming\nof climate change in education, training and\npublic awareness.\n\nSection 6 provides a brief description of the\ncountry status on capacity-building activities at\nthe national, regional and sub-regional levels.\nThis\nincludes\nplans\nof\nthe\ncountry\nin\nstrengthening the coordination, dissemination\nand sustainability of capacity-building activities\nin the country. The section includes information\non Kenya’s efforts to promote information\nsharing.\n\nSection 7 describes the country’s constraints\nand gaps, and related financial, technical and\ncapacity\nneeds.\nAs\nassociated\nwith\nthe\nimplementation of activities, measures and\nprogrammes envisaged under the Convention,\nand with the preparation and improvement of\nnational communications on a continuous basis.\n\nSTEPS TAKEN TO INTEGRATE CLIMATE\nCHANGE INTO RELEVANT POLICIES\n\nKenya is highly vulnerable to climate change\nand therefore faces challenges in economic\ndevelopment. Kenya Vision 2030 – the longterm development blueprint for the country –\naims to transform Kenya into “a newly\nindustrialising,\nmiddle-income\ncountry\nproviding a high quality of life to all its citizens\nin a clean and secure environment.” As Kenya\nstrives to achieve middle income status,\nnational development is challenged by the\nenvironmental\nconsequences\nof\neconomic\ngrowth and the presence of climate change. In\nrecognition of the serious threats posed by\nclimate change and in adhering towards the\nimplementation\nof\nthe\nConvention\nthe\nGovernment as discussed below has taken and\ncontinues to take bold measures to secure the\ncountry’s development against the risks and\nimpacts of climate change.\n\n194\n\nKEY POLICIES CONTAINING MEASURES TO\nMAINSTREAM CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nIn recognition of the serious threats posed by\nclimate change and the need to implement the\nConvention, the Government has taken and\ncontinues to take measures to secure the\ncountry’s development against the risks and\nimpacts of climate change. The main strategies\nand policies, as well as other relevant sectoral\npolicies are described below.\n\nKenya’s National Climate Change Response\nStrategy (NCCRS)\n\nIn 2010, the Government launched a National\nClimate Change Response Strategy (NCCRS). The\nStrategy was the country’s first national policy\ndocument to fully recognize the reality of\nclimate change. It provided evidence of climate\nimpacts on different economic sectors and\nproposed adaptation and mitigation strategies.\nIt presented a series of observed climatic trends\nin Kenya, including a general warming over land\nlocations. The Strategy not only improved\nunderstanding of the global climate change\nregime and the impacts of climate change in the\ncountry but also been guiding policy decisions\nsince its launch.\n\nKenya’s National Climate Change Action\nPlan (NCCAP)\n\nA comprehensive NCCAP was launched in 2013.\nIt takes adaptation and mitigation efforts to the\nnext stage of implementation and guides action\nto respond to climate change challenges. The\nNCCAP\nencourages\npeople\ncentred\ndevelopment, ensuring that climate change\nactions\nsupport\nachievement\nof\nKenya’s\ndevelopment goals and Vision 2030.\n\nThe NCCAP was developed, through an\nextensive\nconsultative\nprocess,\nand\nhas\nreceived support from a wide range of\nstakeholders including development partners.\n\nEight subcomponents form the core of the\nNCCAP and represent long-term and integrated\nstrategies for achieving key climate change\ngoals. The eight subcomponents are;\n\nSubcomponent 1: Long-term National Low\nCarbon\nClimate\nResilient\nDevelopment\nPathway facilitates mainstreaming of climate\nchange aspects in the country’s long term\ndevelopment planning and budgeting. The\nMinistry responsible for planning has used this\nas a platform to integrate climate change into\nthe Vision 2030 Medium Term Plan (20132017).\nSubcomponent\n2:\nEnabling",

Such functions, include:\nproviding analytical support and technical\nassistance on climate change and coordinating\nthe implementation of and reporting on the\nNCCAPs as well as capacity building support\nat the two levels of government – National\nand County Governments.\nThe Act obligates, at the sectoral level, state\ndepartments and agencies to establish Climate\nChange Units (CCUs) to integrate NCCAP actions\ninto their strategies and implementation plans.\nThe Directorate performs coordination work\nthrough the Climate Change Units established\nin all ministries, counties, departments and\nagencies. At the sub-national level, county\ngovernments are required to designate a\nCounty Executive Committee member to\ncoordinate climate change in each county\nthrough the establishment of a Climate Change\nUnit (CCU).\nThe Act designates the National Environment\nManagement Authority (NEMA) as the body\nresponsible for enforcing climate change\nduties for state and non-state actors. With\nthe amendment of the Act in 2023, NEMA was\nalso appointed as the Designated National\nAuthority (DNA) for market mechanisms and\nother mechanisms stemming from Article 6\nof the Paris Agreement.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n6\n7\n\n2\nThe NDC\nDevelopment Process\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n9\n\nThe process for preparing Kenya’s New\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC 20312035) was characterised by significant time\nconstraints and the need to respond to new\ngovernment priorities, including strengthening\nimplementation of the NDC and boosting\nprivate sector interest. The New NDC has\nbeen developed in the context of the country’s\nnational circumstances and development\nagenda with a strong focus on gender equity.\nIt builds on existing national policies and legal\nframeworks, including the Constitution of\nKenya (2010), the Climate Change Act (2016),\nthe First Nationally Determined Contribution\n(2021 – 2030), the Third National Climate\nChange Action Plan (2023 – 2027), the National\nAdaptation Plan (2015 – 2030) and the Draft\nKenya’s Long-Term Low-Emission Development\nStrategy (LT-LEDS).\nThe Climate Change Directorate of the Ministry\nof Environment, Climate Change and Forestry,\nand in consultation with relevant departments\nand agencies across the government,\nconducted a detailed analysis to underpin the\nadaptation and mitigation targets upto 2035,\nreviewing a range of pathways for each sector\nof the economy that contributes significant\ngreenhouse gas emissions in line with the\nnational circumstances, the latest National\nInventory Report and the IPCC guidelines.\nThis was enriched by a comprehensive gender\nanalysis. Technology availability, potential cost\nimplications were considered, as well as the\nrole of enabling infrastructure. Incentives, and\nsupport for innovation are to be considered at\nthe detailed action design phase. Additionally,\nthere were youth specific consultation meetings\nto ensure intergenerational equity and inclusion\nof youth in the development of the NDC.\nIn order to ensure alignment and coherence\nwith Kenya’s national circumstances, sustainable\ndevelopment agenda, government objectives\nand plans, the process started with a review\nof the relevant national plans, policies and\nlegislation at both national and sector levels.\nRelevant data was collected from different\nsectors and analysed to understand and\nupdate both climate impacts and the extent\nof implementation of climate actions to date,\nand to identify potential NDC priority actions.\nVarious adaptation and mitigation actions\nwere proposed based on inputs from both\ngovernment and other stakeholders. The\nactions were then analysed to determine\npotential impacts and to identify potential\npriority actions for further analysis and\nconsultations. Comprehensive gender analysis\ninformed the revision throughout the process.\nThe NDC development process was\ngovernment-led through the Climate Change\nDirectorate of the Ministry of Environment,\nClimate Change and Forestry. The process,\nwhich entailed planning, review of official\ngovernment documents, public consultations\nand engagements, together with approvals\nat different stages, was not only consultative\nand inclusive, but was also based on clear\ncommunication using the best available\nnational data. A key objective of the process\napplied was to facilitate stakeholder ownership\nand effective implementation using both topdown and bottom-up approaches.\nDuring the NDC 2031-2035 development\nprocess, the consultants worked closely\nwith the stakeholders in an inclusive and\nconsultative manner to update and enhance\nKenya’s contributions. Stakeholders were\nidentified from various national and county\ngovernment sectors, civil society, academia\nand private sector. To ensure inputs went\nbeyond technical analysis and considered\nother aspects of Kenyan life, a range of other\nstakeholders representing the distinctive\nperspectives of the Kenyan people were\nconsulted, including the private sector, the\nlabour movement, environmental justice\norganisations, youth organisations, subnational (county) governments, and others.\nUsing both individual and group approaches,\nconsultations were conducted at different\nstages of the process as physical or virtual\nworkshops.\nIn line with paragraph 22-35 of decision 1/\nCP.21 and Decision 4/CMA .1 and its annex,\nthe process was structured to support\nenhancement of mitigation, adaptation and\ntransparent communication, together with\nthe alignment of the NDC with the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). The data and\ninformation collected from the document\nreview and various consultations were used for\nthe simultaneous determination and design\nof the New NDC, including mitigation and\nadaptation enhancements. The enhancements\nhave not only targeted mitigation ambitions\nof the NDC, but also the strengthening of\nthe NDC’s implementation. The adaptation\ncomponent of the NDC draws from the National\nAdaptation Plan (NAP). 3\nThe NDC Ambition\nThis bold\nstrategy\npositions Kenya\nas a regional\nleader in\ngreen energy\ntransition.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n10\n11\n\nKenya’s New NDC includes both mitigation\nand adaptation components based on\nher national circumstances, noting that\nclimate action must lead to socio-economic\ndevelopment. Kenya aims to achieve her longterm development objectives through a low\ncarbon, climate resilient pathway in inclusive\nand equitable ways that foster just transition\nfor sustainability. The mitigation and adaptation\ninterventions outlined in this NDC are designed\nto maximize co-benefits (between mitigation\nand adaptation), enhancing resilience in Kenya’s\nclimate-vulnerable socio-economic sectors\nwhile contributing to emission reductions.\nThese measures address projected climate\nimpacts for 2031–2035 and integrate genderresponsive approaches to account for differing\nvulnerabilities across population groups. Kenya\nwill implement its NDC through the National\nClimate Change Action Plans (NCCAPs) which\nwill be periodically reviewed.\nCognisant that there exists gender\ndifferentiated vulnerabilities due to climate\nchange impacts, and that men and women\ncontribute differently to the same due to their\nrespective gender roles, Kenya will implement\nthe outlined adaptation and mitigation priorities\nin a gender responsive manner in order to\npromote inclusivity in climate action. To do this,\nKenya will advance meaningful participation\nand representation of vulnerable populations\nin climate action through capacity building and\nskills development, technology and innovations\nas well as targeted inclusive access to climate\nfinance, among other initiatives.\n3.1\nMitigation\nKenya’s ambitious mitigation target is economywide, designed to lead to emission reductions\nacross all sectors without compromising socioeconomic development. Priority mitigation\nactions will be achieved through policies,\nprograms and measures, with additional\nemission reductions being realized through\ncarbon markets, while promoting sustainable\ndevelopment and environmental integrity.\nKenya will develop and periodically review\nher whitelist for 2031 to 2035 to support her\nparticipation in carbon markets and other\nmechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris\nAgreement. Additionally, Kenya will set annual\ntargets for the NDC implementation period to\nguide her participation in these mechanisms.\nAs part of the mitigation approach, Kenya will\nleverage carbon markets to attract investment\nand enhance its mitigation ambition. Pursuant\nto the provisions for a whitelist of eligible\ntechnologies and projects in the Climate Change\nAct (Cap. 387A), carbon market activities will\nset aside a portion of its mitigation outcomes\nfor domestic use towards achievement of her\nNDC.

effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of\npolicies, projects and programmes to ensure\naccountability, and inform decision-making.\nMonitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV)\nsystem is crucial for tracking Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (NDCs) as it ensures\ntransparency, accountability, and credibility in\nclimate commitments.\nKenya continues to strengthen its MRV\nsystem, including an integrated MRV tool for\nmonitoring and reporting both mitigation and\nadaptation actions, together with their results.\nTo facilitate tracking of climate change actions\nand reporting, Kenya will review and develop\nM&E Framework to align with this NDC. The\nMRV system is designed to be interoperable\nwith existing systems that includes National\nIntegrated Monitoring and Evaluation System\n(NIMES) and County Integrated Monitoring\nand Evaluation System (CIMES).\nIn line with the Climate Change Act, Monitoring,\nReporting and Verification of the NDC will be\ncoordinated by the Climate Change Directorate.\nDuring the NDC implementation period\n(2031-2035) Climate Change Directorate will\ncoordinate State and Non-State actors in\ndeveloping annual, mid-term and end-term\nreports. The reports generated through the\nIntegrated MRV System will provide input\nfor both national and international reporting\nobligations and help to foster global progress\ntowards the shared goal of combating climate\nchange and securing a sustainable future.\n5\nFairness in the\nAmbition\nThe sequenced\nripple effect of\naffordable and\nreliable energy\nis poised to\ndrive the NDC\nmitigation goal.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n26\n27\n\nKenya’s 2031 – 2035 NDC represents a level\nof sacrifice which is far beyond Kenya’s fair\nshare of ambition towards the achievement of\nglobal climate goals. Kenya’s contribution to\nboth current and historical global emissions\nis negligible (less than 0.1%). By October\n2021, it was estimated that cumulative\nglobal anthropogenic emissions since 1850\nwas around 2,500Gt CO2, specifically from\ndeveloped countries, leaving less than\n500Gt CO2 of remaining carbon budget\nto stay below 1.5°C of warming. Like most\nof Africa, Kenya has historically been a net\nsink, till late 1980s when negligible emissions\ncould be estimated, mainly due to population\ngrowth and pursuit of basic development.\nKenya’s per-capita emissions were less than\n2.09tCO2eq compared to the global average\nof 6.76tCO2eq in 2022.\nKenya’s emission sources are mainly from the\n“hard to abate” sectors, creating the dilemma\nof choosing between the vital climate action\nand the needed socio-economic development.\nKenya is also endowed with fossil fuel natural\nresources while still faced with developmental\nchallenges such as high poverty rates which\ndisproportionately affect the vulnerable\ngender groups, high rates of unemployment\nespecially among the youthful population, and\na huge debt burden. Kenya has demonstrated\nleadership in climate action, by sacrificing (for\nglobal good) the exploitation of brown natural\nresources that could quickly jumpstart the\nGDP, address the debt burden and trigger\neconomic growth, create jobs and trigger\nrapid development, just like other peers whose\neconomies have been transformed due to\ntheir exploitation of fossil fuels.\nThis NDC builds on the Updated First NDC\n(2020) in which Kenya undertook to make a\ncontribution that targeted a high proportion\nof its mitigation potential and was dependent\non the level of international support available.\nThe contributions set through this New NDC\nreflects an enhancement of ambition in the\nfollowing areas:\n\tꞏ\nAn increase in emission reduction\ntargets from 32% in the Updated First\nNDC to 35% in this New NDC.\n\tꞏ\nEnhanced domestic contribution from\n13% to 19% of the NDC cost.\nThis represents a high level of fairness\nand ambition in light of Kenya’s national\ncircumstances. 6\nPlanning Process\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n28\n29\n\nKenya’s planning process on mitigation and\nadaptation is based on her development\nplanning processes. It is worth noting that\nby 1st January, 2031, the Kenya Vision 2030\nimplementation period will have ended, and\na New Long Term Development Vision will\nbe commencing. This NDC will be updated\nbefore the implementation period to comply\nwith the Medium Term Plans (MTPs) of the\nnew national long term vision, which will also\nbe in sync with NCCAP IV and V as well as the\nnew version of the National Adaptation Plan.\nThe NCCAPs are reviewed every five years\nto inform the Medium Term Planning of the\nNational Long Term Vision.\nMitigation and adaptation actions are\nimplemented across the various sectors and\nat national and county government levels. The\nMinistry of Environment, Clim)ate Change and\nForestry coordinates the country’s climate\nchange affairs through the National Climate\nChange Council and the Climate Change\nDirectorate.\n7\nMeans of\nImplementation\nKenya’s NDC\n(2031–2035)\nadopts a\ncoherent\nstrategy of\nwhole-ofgovernment,\nwhole-of-society\napproach to\nclimate action.\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n30\n31\n\nKenya’s contribution will be implemented\nthrough both domestic and international\nsupport. It is estimated that USD 56 Billion\nis required for mitigation and adaptation\nactions across sectors from 1st January 2031\ntill 31st December 2035. Of the estimated total\nbudget, 40% (USD 22.5 Billion) is required\nfor mitigation efforts that will also catalyse\nKenya’s rapid socio-economic development\nin a low carbon climate resilient development\npathway. Approximately 32% (USD 17.7 Billion)\nof the budget will support adaptation activities\ndesigned to make Kenya resilient to the\nincreasing magnitude and frequency of the\nclimate change impacts. The remaining 28%\n(USD 15.8 Billion) comprises of projects\ndesigned to dually deliver mitigation and\nadaptation benefits. Subject to national\ncircumstances, Kenya will endeavour to mobilize\ndomestic resources to meet approximately\n19% (USD 10.5 Billion, at USD 2.1 Billion\nper year) of this budget. Approximately USD\n45.36 Billion (81%) will require international\nsupport. Since all loans have a repayment\nconsequence to the Kenyan taxpayer, Kenya\nwill consider climate finance support received\nin loan instruments as part of her domestic\ncontribution. Kenya will develop an elaborate\ninvestment plan for the actions outlined in\nthis NDC.\nIt is estimated\nthat USD\n56 Billion is\nrequired for\nmitigation and\nadaptation\nactions across\nsectors\nKENYA’S SECOND NATIONALLY DETERMINED\nCONTRIBUTION (2031 – 2035)\n32\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF KENYA\nMinistry of Environment,\nClimate Change and Forestry\nDesign and Layout by:",
