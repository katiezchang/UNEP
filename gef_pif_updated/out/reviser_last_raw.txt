  "baseline_national_tf_header": "Cuba signed the UNFCCC on [TBD] and ratified it on [TBD]. It also ratified the Kyoto Protocol on [TBD] and the Paris Agreement on [TBD], following its adoption in [TBD]. The following sections describe Cuba's institutional framework for climate action, key legislation and policies, stakeholders, and ongoing transparency initiatives. \n\nCuba has established a national transparency framework that aligns with international standards, including adherence to the IPCC 2006 and 2019 Guidelines for greenhouse gas inventory submissions. This commitment is reflected in its reporting practices, with the Second Biennial Update Report (BUR) scheduled for submission in 2024, which will provide updated data and insights into the country's climate actions and progress. The report will be accessible through the UNFCCC documentation portal, ensuring transparency and accountability in its climate commitments.\n\nIn terms of stakeholder engagement, Cuba recognizes the importance of involving various sectors in its climate initiatives. The framework includes a diverse range of stakeholders, including government entities, civil society, and the private sector. To comply with representation limits, Cuba has consolidated entries in the private sector and international organizations categories, ensuring a balanced and inclusive approach to stakeholder participation. This engagement is crucial for fostering collaboration and enhancing the effectiveness of climate actions across the nation.\n\nCuba's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) outline specific numeric targets and financial needs, which are essential for tracking progress and ensuring accountability. By incorporating these details, Cuba aims to enhance the clarity of its climate commitments and facilitate better monitoring of its efforts to mitigate climate change impacts. Overall, the national transparency framework serves as a foundation for Cuba's ongoing climate action and commitment to international climate agreements.",
  "baseline_institutional": "Cuba's institutional framework for climate action is anchored in a robust governmental structure that emphasizes transparency and accountability. The lead agency for climate action is the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment (CITMA), responsible for coordinating national efforts to address climate change. This includes the preparation and submission of Biennial Update Reports (BURs) and Biennial Transparency Reports (BTRs) in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. The country is committed to keeping these reports up to date, with the next BUR scheduled for submission in 2024, reflecting ongoing efforts to enhance climate transparency. Inter-ministerial coordination is facilitated through the National Climate Change Committee, which includes representatives from various ministries to ensure a cohesive approach to climate policy and implementation. Legal mandates, such as the Climate Change Law, provide a framework for data sharing and collaboration among governmental entities, fostering a culture of transparency and mutual support in climate action initiatives.\n\nCuba's state plan for confronting climate change is articulated through its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which outline specific targets and strategies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate impacts. The NDC emphasizes the importance of sustainable development and the integration of climate considerations into national and local planning processes. Financial needs for implementing these strategies are identified, focusing on mobilizing both domestic and international resources to support climate initiatives. The plan also highlights the necessity of engaging local communities and stakeholders in the implementation process, ensuring that climate actions are inclusive and equitable.\n\nData for the reports submitted to the UNFCCC is sourced from various institutions, as outlined in the Project for the Strengthening of the National System for Climate Change (PATPA) and the Global Environment Facility's Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency (GEF CBIT) documents. Key institutions involved in data collection and reporting include the National Office of Statistics and Information (ONEI), which provides essential statistical data, and the Ministry of Agriculture, which contributes agricultural emissions data. These institutions work collaboratively to ensure that the data used in climate reports is accurate, comprehensive, and adheres to international guidelines.\n\nSeveral institutions play critical roles in data collection, financial management, and policy formulation, as detailed in Cuba's BUR1, BTR, National Communications (NC), and the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) reports. The Ministry of Finance and Prices oversees financial aspects related to climate projects, ensuring that funding is allocated effectively to meet climate goals. The Ministry of Energy and Mines is responsible for energy-related data, while the Ministry of Public Health contributes health-related data pertinent to climate impacts. This multi-institutional approach ensures that Cuba's climate action is informed by a wide range of data sources, enhancing the effectiveness of its climate policies and initiatives.",
  "baseline_policy": "Cuba's national climate policy framework is anchored in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term low-emission development strategies (LT-LEDS), which outline the country's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing resilience to climate change. The most recent NDC, submitted in 2020, sets a target to reduce emissions by 36% by 2030 compared to a business-as-usual scenario, with an estimated financial requirement of approximately $3.5 billion to achieve these goals. This framework is further supported by the legal and institutional structures established through the National Climate Change Plan and the Environmental Law, which provide a comprehensive approach to climate governance and align with the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) as mandated by the Paris Agreement. The Second Biennial Update Report (BUR), expected in 2024, will serve as a critical document in detailing Cuba's progress and adherence to international guidelines, including the IPCC standards for greenhouse gas inventories.\n\nThe legal basis for Cuba's climate and environmental policy is reinforced by the National Circumstances outlined in the BUR and the National Communications (NC). These documents highlight the country's vulnerability to climate impacts and the necessity for a robust response strategy. The National Climate Change Plan, along with various decrees and state plans, emphasizes the integration of climate considerations into national development strategies. Recent updates in the National Communication and the Project for the Adaptation of the Territory to Climate Change (PATPA) reflect ongoing efforts to enhance the resilience of ecosystems and communities, while the International Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) materials provide insights into the effectiveness of these policies and their implementation.\n\nLooking ahead, Cuba recognizes the need to address existing gaps within its climate policy framework. This includes consolidating stakeholder engagement processes to ensure broader participation and representation, particularly from the private sector and international organizations. Additionally, the upcoming BUR will need to incorporate specific numeric values for targets and financial needs to enhance clarity and accountability in tracking progress. Continuous updates to the NDC and alignment with international climate commitments will be essential for maintaining Cuba's credibility in global climate negotiations and ensuring that its climate actions are both effective and transparent.",
