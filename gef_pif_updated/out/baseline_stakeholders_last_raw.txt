{"body":"Non-government stakeholders for climate action in Cuba include a diverse range of organizations and institutions that play critical roles in addressing climate change. Civil society organizations (CSOs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are actively involved in advocacy, education, and community engagement related to climate issues. The private sector is also making strides, particularly in renewable energy, with companies like Cuba Solar and the Cuban Renewable Energy Association leading initiatives to promote solar energy technologies and installations. Academia contributes significantly through research institutions such as the University of Havana and the Cuban Institute of Tropical Research, which focus on climate impacts and adaptation strategies, as well as biodiversity studies that enhance climate resilience.

Financial institutions, including the Cuban Development Bank, are pivotal in financing sustainable development projects that align with national climate goals. International organizations provide additional support through partnerships and funding mechanisms aimed at enhancing Cuba's climate action efforts. These stakeholders collectively contribute to the country's climate action framework, leveraging their unique capabilities and resources to address the challenges posed by climate change. The collaboration among these entities is essential for advancing Cuba's commitments under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other climate-related frameworks."}
